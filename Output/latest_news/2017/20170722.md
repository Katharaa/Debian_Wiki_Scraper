Updated Debian 9: 9.1 released
==============================


**July 22nd, 2017**


The Debian project is pleased to announce the first update of its
stable distribution Debian 9 (codename stretch).
This point release mainly adds corrections for security issues,
along with a few adjustments for serious problems. Security advisories
have already been published separately and are referenced where available.


Please note that the point release does not constitute a new version of Debian
9 but only updates some of the packages included. There is
no need to throw away old stretch media. After installation,
packages can be upgraded to the current versions using an up-to-date Debian
mirror.


Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have
to update many packages, and most such updates are
included in the point release.


New installation images will be available soon at the regular locations.


Upgrading an existing installation to this revision can be achieved by
pointing the package management system at one of Debian's many HTTP mirrors.
A comprehensive list of mirrors is available at:
