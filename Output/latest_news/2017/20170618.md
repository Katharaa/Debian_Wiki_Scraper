Debian Edu / Skolelinux Stretch â a complete Linux solution for your school
=============================================================================


**June 18th, 2017**



Do you have to administrate a computer lab or a whole school network?
Would you like to install servers, workstations and laptops which
will then work together?
Do you want the stability of Debian with network services already
preconfigured?
Do you wish to have a web-based tool to manage systems and several
hundred or even more user accounts?
Have you asked yourself if and how older computers could be used?




Then Debian Edu is for you. The teachers themselves or their technical support
can roll out a complete multi-user multi-machine study environment within
a few days. Debian Edu comes with hundreds of applications pre-installed,
but you can always add more packages from Debian.




The Debian Edu developer team is happy to announce Debian Edu 9
Stretch, the first Debian Edu / Skolelinux release based
on the DebianÂ 9 Stretch release.
Please consider testing it and reporting back (<debian-edu@lists.debian.org>)
to help us to improve it further.



About Debian Edu and Skolelinux
-------------------------------



[Debian Edu, also known as
Skolelinux](http://www.skolelinux.org/), is a Linux distribution based on Debian providing an
out-of-the box environment of a completely configured school network.
Immediately after installation a school server running all services
needed for a school network is set up just waiting for users and
machines to be added via GOsaÂ², a comfortable web interface.
A netbooting environment is prepared, so after initial
installation of the main server from CD or USB stick all other
machines can be installed via the network.
Older computers (even up to ten or so years old) can be used as LTSP
thin clients or diskless workstations, booting from the network without
any installation at all.
The Debian Edu school server provides an LDAP database and Kerberos
authentication service, centralized home directories, a DHCP server, a web
proxy and many other services. The desktop contains more than 60 educational
software packages and more are available from the Debian archive.
Schools can choose between the desktop environments KDE Plasma, GNOME, LXDE,
MATE and Xfce.



New features for Debian Edu 9 Stretch
-------------------------------------


These are some items from the release notes for Debian Edu 9 Stretch,
based on the Debian 9 Stretch release.
The full list is part of the manual.



* Plymouth is installed and activated by default, except for the 'Main Server' and 'Minimal' profiles.
* Icinga replaces Nagios as monitoring tool.
* LTSP now uses NBD instead of NFS for the root filesystem.
* A Japanese translation of the manual is now available.


Download options, installation steps and manual
-----------------------------------------------



A multi-architecture CD / USB stick image (647 MiB) for network booting can
be downloaded at the following locations:



* <http://ftp.skolelinux.org/skolelinux-cd/debian-edu-9+edu0-CD.iso>
* `rsync -avzP ftp.skolelinux.org::skolelinux-cd/debian-edu-9+edu0-CD.iso`



Alternatively an extended DVD / USB stick image (5.45 GiB) is also available,
with more software included (saving additional download time during installs):



* <http://ftp.skolelinux.org/skolelinux-cd/debian-edu-9+edu0-USB.iso>
* `rsync -avzP ftp.skolelinux.org::skolelinux-cd/debian-edu-9+edu0-USB.iso`



The images can be verified using the file SHA256SUMS.asc containing signed checksums of the images; see
<http://ftp.skolelinux.org/skolelinux-cd/SHA256SUMS.asc>



  

Once you've downloaded an image, you can check that
* its checksum matches that expected from the checksum file; and that
* the checksum file has not been tampered with.



For more information about how to do these steps, read the
[verification guide](https://www.debian.org/CD/verify).




Debian Edu 9 Stretch is entirely based on Debian 9 Stretch; so the sources
for all packages are available from the Debian archive.
