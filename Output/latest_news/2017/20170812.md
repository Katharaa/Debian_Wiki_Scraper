**August 12th, 2017**



Today, Saturday 12 August 2017, the annual Debian Developers
and Contributors Conference came to a close.
With over 405 people attending from all over the world
(see the [DebConf17 group photo](https://annex.debconf.org/debconf-share/debconf17/photos/aigarius/debcond17%20group%20photo.jpg)),
and 169 events including 89 talks, 61 discussion sessions or BoFs,
6 workshops and 13 other activities,
[DebConf17](https://debconf17.debconf.org) has been hailed as a success.




Highlights included DebCamp with 117 participants,
the [Open Day](https://debconf17.debconf.org/news/2017-08-05-open-day/),
where events of interest to a broader audience were offered,
talks from invited speakers
([Deb Nicholson](https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/183/),
[Matthew Garrett](https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/177/)
and [Katheryn Sutter](https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/134/)),
the traditional Bits from the DPL, lightning talks and live demos
and the announcement of next year's DebConf (DebConf18 in Hsinchu, Taiwan).




The [schedule](https://debconf17.debconf.org/schedule/)
has been updated every day, including 32 ad-hoc new activities, planned
by attendees during the whole conference.




For those not able to attend, talks and sessions were recorded and live streamed,
and videos are being made available at the
[Debian meetings archive website](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2017/debconf17).
Many sessions also facilitated remote participation via IRC or a collaborative pad.




The [DebConf17](https://debconf17.debconf.org/) website
will remain active for archive purposes, and will continue to offer
links to the presentations and videos of talks and events.




Next year, [DebConf18](https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf18) will be held in Hsinchu, Taiwan, from 29 July 2018
until 5 August 2018. It will be the first DebConf held in Asia.
For the days before DebConf the local organisers will again set up DebCamp
(21 July - 27 July),
a session for some intense work on improving the distribution,
and organise the Open Day on 28 July 2018, aimed at the general public.




DebConf is committed to a safe and welcome environment for all participants.
