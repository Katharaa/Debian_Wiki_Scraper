Statement concerning the arrest of Dmitry Bogatov
=================================================


**April 17th, 2017**



The Debian Project is concerned to hear that one of our members,
Dmitry Bogatov, has been arrested by Russian authorities.




Dmitry is a mathematics teacher, and an active Debian contributor.
As a Debian Maintainer, he worked in the Debian Haskell group
and currently maintains several packages for command line
and system tools.




We await further details of the case against him,
but hope that he receives fair treatment and due process.




In the meantime, the Debian Project has taken measures to secure
its systems by removing Dmitry's keys in the case
that they are compromised.




The Debian Project honours his good work and strong dedication
to Debian and Free Software, and we hope he is back
as soon as possible to his endeavours.




We send our full support to him and his family.
