Shutting down public FTP services
=================================


**April 25th, 2017**



After many years of serving the needs of our users,
and some more of declining usage in favor of better options,
all public-facing debian.org FTP services
will be shut down on November 1, 2017. These are:


* `ftp://ftp.debian.org`
* `ftp://security.debian.org`


This decision is driven by the following considerations:


* FTP servers have no support for caching or acceleration.
* Most software implementations have stagnated
and are awkward to use and configure.
* Usage of the FTP servers is pretty low as our own installer
has not offered FTP as a way to access mirrors for over ten years.
* The protocol is inefficient and requires adding awkward kludges to
firewalls and load-balancing daemons.


Information for users
---------------------


The DNS names `ftp.debian.org`
and `ftp.<CC>.debian.org`
will remain the same.
The mirrors should just be accessed using HTTP instead:


* `http://ftp.debian.org`
* `http://security.debian.org`


Information for developers
--------------------------


Our developer services will not be affected.
These are the upload queues for both the main and the security archive:


* `ftp://ftp.upload.debian.org`
* `ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org`
