Debian 8 Jessie released
========================


**April 25th, 2015**


After almost 24 months of constant development the Debian project is
proud to present its new stable version 8 (code name Jessie),
which will be supported for the next 5 years thanks to the combined
work of the [Debian Security
team](http://security-team.debian.org/) and of the [Debian Long Term
Support](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS) team.



Jessie ships with a new default init system, `systemd`. The
`systemd` suite provides many exciting features such as faster
boot times, cgroups for services, and the possibility of isolating part of
the services. The `sysvinit` init system is still available
in Jessie.




The UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) support introduced in
Wheezy has also been greatly improved in Jessie.
This includes workarounds for many known firmware bugs, support
for UEFI on 32-bit systems, and support for 64-bit kernels with 32-bit UEFI
firmware (with the latter being included only on our `amd64/i386`
multi-arch installation media).



Since the previous release, members of the Debian project have also
made important improvements to our supporting services. One of these is [a browsable
view of all source code shipped in Debian](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2013/14/#sources) currently available at
[sources.debian.net](https://sources.debian.net). Of
course, with over 20,000 source packages, it can be quite daunting to
locate the right file. Therefore, we are also very
pleased to present [Debian Code
Search](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2014/17/#DCS), available at [codesearch.debian.net](https://codesearch.debian.net/).
Both services are complemented by a completely rewritten and more
responsive [package tracking system](https://tracker.debian.org/).




This release includes numerous updated software packages, such as:



* Apache 2.4.10
* Asterisk 11.13.1
* GIMP 2.8.14
* an updated version of the GNOME desktop environment 3.14
* GNU Compiler Collection 4.9.2
* Icedove 31.6.0 (an unbranded version of Mozilla Thunderbird)
* Iceweasel 31.6.0esr (an unbranded version of Mozilla Firefox)
* KDE Plasma Workspaces and KDE Applications 4.14.2
* LibreOffice 4.3.3
* Linux 3.16.7-ckt9
* MariaDB 10.0.16 and MySQL 5.5.42
* Nagios 3.5.1
* OpenJDK 7u75
* Perl 5.20.2
* PHP 5.6.7
* PostgreSQL 9.4.1
* Python 2.7.9 and 3.4.2
* Samba 4.1.17
* Tomcat 7.0.56 and 8.0.14
* Xen Hypervisor 4.4.1
* the Xfce 4.10 desktop environment
* more than 43,000 other ready-to-use software packages, built from
nearly 20,100 source packages.



With this broad selection of packages and its traditional wide architecture support,
Debian once again stays true
to its goal of being the universal operating system. It is suitable
for many different use cases: from desktop systems to netbooks; from
development servers to cluster systems; and for database, web, or
storage servers. At the same time, additional quality assurance
efforts like automatic installation and upgrade tests for all packages
in Debian's archive ensure that Jessie fulfills the high
expectations that users have of a stable Debian release.




A total of ten architectures are supported: 32-bit PC / Intel IA-32
(`i386`), 64-bit PC / Intel EM64T / x86-64
(`amd64`), Motorola/IBM PowerPC (`powerpc` for
older hardware and `ppc64el` for the new 64-bit
(little-endian)), MIPS (`mips` (big-endian) and
`mipsel` (little-endian)), IBM S/390 (64-bit
`s390x`) and for ARM, `armel` and `armhf`
for old and new 32-bit hardware, plus `arm64` for the new 64-bit
AArch64 architecture.


### Want to give it a try?



If you simply want to try Debian 8 Jessie without having to install it, you can use a
special image, known as a live image, available for CDs, USB sticks, and netboot
setups. Initially, these images are provided for the `amd64` and
`i386` architectures only. It is also possible to use these live
images to install Debian. More information is available from the
[Debian Live homepage](http://live.debian.net/).




If, instead, you want to install it to your computer's permanent storage, you can choose from
a range of installation media, such as Blu-ray Discs, DVDs,
CDs, and USB sticks, or from the network. Several desktop environments —
GNOME, KDE Plasma Desktop and Applications, Xfce, and LXDE — may be
installed through CD images; the desired one may be chosen from the boot menus
of the CDs/DVDs. In addition, multi-architecture CDs and DVDs are available
which support installation of multiple architectures from a single disc.
Or you can always create bootable USB installation media
(see the [Installation Guide](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/installmanual)
for more details). For cloud users Debian also offers
[pre-built
OpenStack images](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/openstack/current/), ready to use.




The installation images may be downloaded right now via
[bittorrent](https://www.debian.org/CD/torrent-cd/) (the recommended method),
[jigdo](https://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/#which), or
[HTTP](https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/); see
[Debian on CDs](https://www.debian.org/CD/) for further information. Jessie will
soon be available on physical DVD, CD-ROM, and Blu-ray Discs from
numerous [vendors](https://www.debian.org/CD/vendors) too.



### Upgrading Debian



Upgrades to Debian 8 from the previous release, Debian
7 (codenamed Wheezy), are automatically handled by
the apt-get package management tool for most configurations.
As always, Debian systems may be upgraded painlessly, in place,
without any forced downtime, but it is strongly recommended to read
the [release notes](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/releasenotes) as well as
the [installation guide](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/installmanual)
for possible issues, and for detailed instructions on installing and
upgrading. The release notes will be further improved and translated
to additional languages in the weeks after the release.



About Debian
------------



Debian is a free operating system, developed by
thousands of volunteers from all over the world who collaborate via the
Internet. The Debian project's key strengths are its volunteer base, its
dedication to the Debian Social Contract and Free Software, and its commitment to provide
the best operating system possible. Debian 8 is another important step
in that direction.
