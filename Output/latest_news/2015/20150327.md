Imagination maintains momentum for Debian MIPS ports
====================================================


**March 27th, 2015**



In October of 2014, Imagination Technologies donated several
MIPS-based machines for Debian development; these include
substantially faster Loongson 3A (mipsel) and Cavium Octeon II (mips)
servers. The brand new machines include three Loongson LS3A-RS780E
development boards, one Lemote 3A ITX and three EdgeRouter Pro 8 port
machines.




Debian's distributed build cluster requires high performance and high
reliability from the machines used, explains Aurelien Jarno, Debian
MIPS port maintainer. We are confident that these devices will help us
build and maintain Debian's MIPS ports over the next release cycles.




The Debian MIPS ports are also possible thanks to donations from the
AQL hosting service provider, the Eaton remote controlled ePDU and
many other individual members of the Debian community.
