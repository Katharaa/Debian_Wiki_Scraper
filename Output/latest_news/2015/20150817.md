Debian and Software Freedom Conservancy announce Copyright Aggregation Project
==============================================================================


**August 17th, 2015**


### New Services Agreement Implemented between Conservancy and Debian


This past weekend, in his keynote at DebConf
(the [Debian
Project](https://www.debian.org/)'s [annual conference in
Heidelberg, Germany](https://debconf15.debconf.org/)), Software Freedom Conservancy's Distinguished
Technologist and
President, [Bradley
M. Kuhn, announced](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2015/aug/17/debian/) Conservancy's Debian Copyright Aggregation Project.
This new project, formed at the request of Debian developers, gives Debian
contributors various new options to ensure the defense of software freedom.
Specifically, Debian contributors may chose to either assign their copyrights to
Conservancy for permanent stewardship, or sign Conservancy's license
enforcement agreement, which delegates to Conservancy authority to enforce
Free Software licenses (such as the GNU General Public License). Several
Debian contributors have already signed both forms of agreement.


Former [Debian Project Leader
 (DPL)](https://www.debian.org/devel/leader), Stefano Zacchiroli enthusiastically welcomed the program,
 saying: I urged Conservancy to work with Debian to create this program.
 Holding copyright on Free Software code is a privilege, but also a huge
 responsibility. Debian Developers have asked me for years a way to make
 sure some charity they can trust looked after their hard work and ensured
 Free Software licenses were upheld. Conservancy is the best partner I can
 imagine for this job. I've signed up myself for the program!


On behalf of the Debian community, Conservancy can now safeguard the long
term interests of Debian and its commitment to software freedom. In connection with the Aggregation Project, Conservancy will provide license consulting, advice, and compliance services to Debian in coordination with the
DPL. The framework for all
these services to the Debian community was implemented by Lucas Nussbaum
during his term as DPL. The agreement established the DPL as the primary
contact point for the services agreement.


Neil McGovern, the current DPL, stated: With this new program, Debian
 has a fantastic opportunity to build an ongoing collaboration with
 Conservancy to enforce Debian contributors' rights in accordance with
 the [Debian
 Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines). I welcome the experience and sage
 advice from Conservancy on licensing and policy matters, and applaud
 their various other efforts on software freedom.


Conservancy can now accept assignment agreements or
enforcement agreements for any Debian contributors who choose to join the
Aggregation Project. Currently, Debian developers interested in this program
can contact
[debian-services@sfconservancy.org](mailto:debian-services@sfconservancy.org).
The DPL and Conservancy are working together to create a self-service system
for filing the paperwork.


Kuhn's keynote from DebConf is available [in

Conservancy's website](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2015/aug/17/debian/).

The Debian Project was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock to be a truly

supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the
universal operating system.
