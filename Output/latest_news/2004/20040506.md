Debian adds integrated XML Support
==================================


**May 6th, 2004**


The upcoming stable Debian release (code-named sarge) will feature fully
integrated XML support. Multiple toolchains for XSL(T) processing, a
fully standards-compliant XML catalog system, and a Debian XML policy
document for both Debian developers and users provide the backbone of a
complete, out-of-the-box system for XML developers and authors.


Supplementing the already integrated SGML and DSSSL infrastructure and
packages, the resulting innovative XML subsystem positions Debian as a
premier platform for SGML and XML developers, offering a complete
working set of tools for documenters and markup programmers with no manual
setup required.


### Features


* Standards-compliant hierarchical [implementation](https://debian-xml-sgml.alioth.debian.org/xml-policy/xml-catalogs.html) of
 the OASIS XML Catalogs [specification](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/4952/wd-entity-xml-catalogs-1.0_2e.html).
* XML catalog system maintenance tool (update-xmlcatalog).
* Complete policy documents for both [XML](https://debian-xml-sgml.alioth.debian.org/xml-policy/) and
 [SGML](https://debian-xml-sgml.alioth.debian.org/sgml-policy/) implementation on Debian systems.
* Developer [documentation/guidelines](https://debian-xml-sgml.alioth.debian.org/xml-policy/xml-registering-resources.html) for
 packaging of XML resources and tools
 (`dh_installxmlcatalog`) for registering package
 resources in the XML catalog system.
* Emphasis on maintaining [backwards
 compatibility](https://debian-xml-sgml.alioth.debian.org/xml-policy/xml-migration-symlink.html) with previous Debian releases.
* [FHS](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/) compliant placement of XML resources.
* Integrated editor support for XML with GNU Emacs using the [psgml](https://packages.debian.org/psgml)
 and nxml-mode packages and related tools.


Debian's open model of participation and continuing commitment to
system quality (as reflected in the [Debian Policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/))
puts it head-and-shoulders above other commercial or free
distributions.


### How To Get Involved
