Security Host Downtime
======================


**February 2nd, 2004**


Yesterday around 15:00 UTC the host klecker.debian.org crashed.
Unfortunately, it didn't react on the serial console and to a remotely
issued power-cycle.


The following services are affected by this downtime:



**security.debian.org**

The public security archive. As a temporary solution, please
switch to <http://ftp.rfc822.org/debian-security> instead.



**nonus.debian.org**

The public non-US archive. As a temporary solution, please switch
to <http://ftp.rfc822.org/debian-non-US> instead.



**search.debian.org**

The public search facility for the Debian website.



**qa.debian.org**

The public resources of the quality assurance (QA) team.



**nm.debian.org**

The public resources for new-maintainership organising.



**www-master.debian.org**

The internal master website. This means that no updates to the
public webserver are possible until klecker is restored.




Our site admin will have physical access to the machine in the
colocation facility about noon tomorrow (February 3rd). We hope that
the machine can be revived and that the affected services will be back
at the afternoon.
