Debian mourns the loss of two project members
=============================================


**May 15th, 2004**


Recently, the Debian Project has lost two members of its community.
Manuel Estrada Sainz (ranty) and AndrÃ©s GarcÃ­a (ErConde) were killed in
a tragic car accident while returning from the Free Software conference
held at Valencia, Spain.


Manuel Estrada Sainz was a kernel hacker and maintained a number of
packages in Debian including the VisualOS educational tool, for which he
was the lead developer as well. The Orinoco USB driver as well as the
multi-purpose firmware loading support he developed for the Linux kernel
are also provided in Debian.


AndrÃ©s GarcÃ­a was a Debian advocate, a contributor in the development of
the custom Debian distribution for the Junta de AndalucÃ­a (regional
government for most of southern Spain) and also an active member (and
administrator) within the Spanish Hispalinux association.


The Debian Project honors their good work and strong dedication to
Debian and Free Software. The contributions of both Manuel and AndrÃ©s
will not be forgotten, and other developers will continue their work.


Manuel and AndrÃ©s will both be missed.
