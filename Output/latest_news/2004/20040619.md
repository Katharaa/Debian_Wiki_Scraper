Debian at LinuxTag 2004
=======================


**June 19th, 2004**


This year's LinuxTag will take place from June 23rd to June 26th at
the exhibition and conference center in Karlsruhe, Germany. The
Debian project will attend this show quite actively.


The Debian headquarter will be booth F43 in the exhibition hall, where
we will demonstrate Debian GNU/Linux on several different
architectures, hand out DVDs with a preview of sarge for the i386 and
powerpc architectures, demonstrate sub-projects such as FAI (Fully
Automatic Installation), Adamantix, Debian-Med and m23.


There will also be a Skolelinux booth/class room in the conference
building and a Linux Porting booth (F21) in the exhibition hall where
it is demonstrated that Linux runs on a large variety of hardware
platforms, with Debian as preferred operating system.

On Thursday, June 24th, 2004, the Debian project also holds a mini
Debian conference in room 2.05 in the conference building with the
following schedule:

Not all talks with a relation to Debian fit on the Debian day, hence,
some of them will be delivered outside of it, and some of them are
part of the regular conference schedule.
