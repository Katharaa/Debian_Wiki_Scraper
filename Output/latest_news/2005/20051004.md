Debian Security Hosting Modification
====================================


**October 4th, 2005**


The Debian project has split the public frontend of security.debian.org
to a new machine liberally hosted at Telegraaf Media Groep. By this move
internal and external services of the Debian security infrastructure have
been split which was a major requirement for future improvements of this
service.


After the release of an update to XFree86 (Debian Security Advisory 816)
it became obvious that the old machine was not able to properly serve the
needs of the large number of users anymore. The outgoing 100MBit/s
connection was totally saturated during 70% of the day and the machine
was throttling.


Restructuring the security infrastructure has been discussed before the
incident last month and will continue until the final setup is installed.
The move of the public frontend to a more powerful machine is the first
step towards a more flexible and failsafe solution that can deal with
high bandwidth peaks better than a single machine only.
