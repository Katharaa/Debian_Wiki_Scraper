Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 updated (r6)
=================================


**June 2nd, 2005**


This is the sixth and final update of Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (codename ‘woody’)
which mainly adds security updates to the stable release, along with a
few corrections to serious problems. Those who frequently update from
security.debian.org won't have to update many packages and most
updates from security.debian.org are included in this update.


Please note that this update does not produce a new version of Debian
GNU/Linux 3.0 but only adds a few updated packages to it. There is no
need to throw away 3.0 CDs but only to update against ftp.debian.org
after an installation, in order to incorporate those late changes.


Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
‘apt’ package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to one of
Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors. A comprehensive list of mirrors is
available at:
