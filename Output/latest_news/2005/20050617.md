Debian Project at OSS Symposium, LinuxTag and DebConf
=====================================================


**June 17th, 2005**


The Debian project will attend the Open Source Software Symposium in
Stuttgart and the LinuxTag in Karlsruhe next week, both in Germany.


Three exhibitions and conferences that will cover Free Software and
GNU/Linux will take place within the following weeks in several cities
where the Debian project participates.

 Ostfildern, Germany

The Debian project will run a booth and will present the
distribution at this symposium for business and public
administration. Michael Meskes will also give a talk about
the use of the Debian system in companies and in public
administration.



**June 22nd - 25th: [LinuxTag](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/0622-linuxtag)**,

This is the largest and most important Free Software exhibition
and conference. The Debian project will maintain a booth in
the exhibition area and organise a mini conference called
Debian Day. The new and shiny release of Debian 3.1 alias
sarge will be demonstrated at the booth where visitors can get
pressed DVDs with the release on it for the i386, amd64 and
powerpc platforms.


In addition to this, there will be several other talks that
cover Free Software and Debian in particular. There will also
be a keysigning party again on Saturday which requires to
submit the keys before.

The Debian conference aims at Debian developers and interested
