Debian 7 Long Term Support reaching end-of-life
===============================================


**June 1st, 2018**


The Debian Long Term Support (LTS) Team hereby announces that Debian 7
"Wheezy" support has reached its end-of-life on May 31, 2018,
five years after its initial release on May 4, 2013.


Debian will not provide further security updates for Debian 7. A
subset of Wheezy packages will be supported by external parties. Detailed
information can be found at [Extended LTS](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Extended).


The LTS Team will prepare the transition to Debian 8 "Jessie", which
is the current oldstable release. The LTS team will take over support
from the Security Team on June 17, 2018.


Debian 8 will also receive Long Term Support for five years after its
initial release with support ending on June 30, 2020. The supported
architectures include amd64, i386, armel and armhf.


For further information about using Jessie LTS and upgrading from Wheezy
LTS, please refer to [LTS/Using](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Using).


Debian and its LTS Team would like to thank all contributing users,
developers and sponsors who are making it possible to extend the life
of previous stable releases, and who have made this LTS a success.


If you rely on Debian LTS, please consider
[joining the team](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development),
providing patches, testing or
[funding the efforts](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Funding).
