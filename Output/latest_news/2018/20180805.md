DebConf18 closes in Hsinchu and DebConf19 dates announced
=========================================================


**August 5th, 2018**



Today, Sunday 5 August 2018, the annual Debian Developers
and Contributors Conference came to a close.
With over 306 people attending from all over the world,
and 137 events including 100 talks, 25 discussion sessions or BoFs,
5 workshops and 7 other activities,
[DebConf18](https://debconf18.debconf.org) has been hailed as a success.




Highlights included DebCamp with more than 90 participants,
the [Open Day](https://debconf18.debconf.org/schedule/?day=2018-07-28),
where events of interest to a broader audience were offered,
plenaries like the traditional Bits from the DPL,
a Questions and Answers session with Minister Audrey Tang,
a panel discussion about "Ignoring negativity" with Bdale Garbee, Chris Lamb, Enrico Zini and Steve McIntyre,
the talk "That's a free software issue!!" given by Molly de Blanc and Karen Sandler,
lightning talks and live demos
and the announcement of next year's DebConf
([DebConf19](https://wiki.debian.org/DebConf/19) in Curitiba, Brazil).




The [schedule](https://debconf18.debconf.org/schedule/)
has been updated every day, including 27 ad-hoc new activities, planned
by attendees during the whole conference.




For those not able to attend, most talks and sessions were recorded and live streamed,
and videos are being made available at the
[Debian meetings archive website](https://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2018/DebConf18/).
Many sessions also facilitated remote participation via IRC or a collaborative text document.




The [DebConf18](https://debconf18.debconf.org/) website
will remain active for archive purposes, and will continue to offer
 links to the presentations and videos of talks and events.




Next year, [DebConf19](https://wiki.debian.org/DebConf/19) will be held in Curitiba, Brazil, from
21 July to 28 July, 2019. It will be the second DebConf held in Brazil (first one was DebConf4 in
Porto Alegre).
For the days before DebConf the local organisers will again set up DebCamp
(13 July â 19 July),
a session for some intense work on improving the distribution,
and organise the Open Day on 20 July 2019, open to the general public.




DebConf is committed to a safe and welcome environment for all participants.
See the [DebConf Code of Conduct](https://debconf.org/codeofconduct.shtml)
and the [Debian Code of Conduct](https://www.debian.org/code_of_conduct) for more details on this.
