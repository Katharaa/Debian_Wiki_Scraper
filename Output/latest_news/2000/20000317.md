Debian receives UltraSPARC60 donation
=====================================


**March 17th, 2000**


Debian has recently added another machine to its computing resources. The
system is an UltraSPARC 60 with dual 360Mhz CPU's and 512Megs of RAM. It
was donated by [Sun Microsystems](http://www.sun.com/).
To add to the system, Sun also donated a Netra st A1000 Telecom Class storage array. The array
contains eight 9gig 10k RPM drives, for a total of 72gigs of raw capacity.
The storage unit, configured as a RAID 5 system, will serve as Debian's new
primary internal archive server. [IntraServer](http://www.intraserver.com/)
also assisted in getting this system operational by donating the PCI
Differential UltraWide SCSI Controller that the array is attached to.
The system is currently running Debian's frozen SPARC GNU/Linux
distribution, potato (aka, Debian 2.2), utilizing a 2.2.15-pre11 SMP
kernel. The machine is being hosted at [VisiNet](http://www.visi.net/),
a [Winstar](http://www.winstar.com/) owned ISP.
Debian wishes to thank all of the contributors of the system and hosting
site as well as the developers who invested time and effort into testing and
configuring the system for Debian's network.
