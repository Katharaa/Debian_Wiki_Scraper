New Debian Web Site Search Engine
=================================


**October 25th, 2000**


After an extended period without a search facility, the Debian project
has selected [UdmSearch](http://search.mnogo.ru/) as their web
site indexer. This means that users will be able to perform keywords
searches on the site in their own language.
The [search page](https://search.debian.org/), along with the
rest of the site, uses language content negotiation and has been integrated
to have the same look and feel as all other content on the Debian web site.
[UdmSearch](http://search.mnogo.ru/) uses
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) as its URL and keyword
database and has a [PHP](http://www.php.net/) front end. It is
licensed under the GNU GPL and is currently available in the unstable
'woody' distribution of Debian GNU/Linux.
