Debian project at LinuxFEST 2000
================================


**December 13th, 2000**


The Debian project will run a booth at this year's LinuxFEST in
Belgrad, Yugoslavia. LinuxFEST 2000 takes place from December 15th to
December 18th at the main hall in Dom Omladine in Belgrad, Yugoslavia.
The main aim of the event is to educate people and promote Linux in
a country that has been left far behind the technological
advancements because of the political situation for the past decade.
[LinuxFEST](http://www.linuxfest.org.yu/index_e.html) is
organised by a group of Linux enthusiasts who believe that Linux should come
to Yugoslavia on a large scale and not be employed only in research
organisations, universities and among a few 'geeks'. The event will
comprise a full research conference, promotional talks, exhibitions and
install fest.
