Debian project at Systems exhibition
====================================


**November 4th, 2000**


The Debian project happily announces that they have received an offer to
represent the project and its sane Linux distribution from November 5th to
November 11th as part of LinuxPark at Europe's second most important
computer-oriented exhibition, Systems 2000 in Munich, Germany.
Members of the Debian project are waiting in exhibition hall A3, booth
103-D3 at the Debian booth to answer your questions and demonstrate the
Debian GNU/Linux distribution. If you are interested in the project, just
stop by at the booth. If you plan to become a maintainer at some time, don't
forget to take your GPG key with you.
During the exhibition, on Monday at 6pm, it is planned that Debian
receives a donation from LinuxLand International. They sold more than 1000
copies of their commercial Debian GNU/Linux product within two weeks.
[Systems](http://www.systems.de/) is the second most important
computer-oriented exhibition in Europe.
[LinuxPark](http://www.linux-events.de/en) is a sub-exhibition
within the regular one combining lots of Linux-oriented and -based companies
in one exhibition hall with the addition of open projects.
[LinuxLand International](http://www.linuxland.de/) is an
independent distributor for products based upon Linux, including
applications and distributions.
