First official Test Cycle for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 started
==========================================================


**May 3rd, 2000**


"The first official Test Cycle has started today," said Richard
Braakman, current Debian Release Manager. This is the next milestone
in the release-cycle of "potato", which will become Debian GNU/Linux
2.2 when it is released.
The next few days are dedicated to getting boot-floppies and CD images
ready for testing. No uploads are allowed into potato except the ones
that are substantial for these two systems.
After that, the entire distribution will be tested for about 10 days.
During the period, no changes will be made to the archive. Following
these tests comes an evaluation period, during which either potato
will be released as-is, or new fixes will be installed into the
archive and a new Test Cycle will start.
