Updated Debian 9: 9.11 released
===============================


**September 8th, 2019**


The Debian project is pleased to announce the eleventh update of its
oldstable distribution Debian 9 (codename stretch).


This point release is primarily an update to the recently-released 9.10,
in order to resolve a critical problem with the installer that was discovered
during image testing.


Please note that the point release does not constitute a new version of Debian
9 but only updates some of the packages included. There is
no need to throw away old stretch media. After installation,
packages can be upgraded to the current versions using an up-to-date Debian
mirror.


Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have
to update many packages, and most such updates are
included in the point release.


New installation images will be available soon at the regular locations.


Upgrading an existing installation to this revision can be achieved by
pointing the package management system at one of Debian's many HTTP mirrors.
A comprehensive list of mirrors is available at:
