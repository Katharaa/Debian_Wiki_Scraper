Updated Debian 9: 9.7 released
==============================


**January 23rd, 2019**


The Debian project is pleased to announce the seventh update of its
stable distribution Debian 9 (codename stretch).
This point release incorporates the recent security update for [APT](https://packages.debian.org/src:APT),
in order to help ensure that new installations of stretch are not
vulnerable. No other updates are included.



New installation images will be available soon at the regular locations.


Upgrading an existing installation to this revision can be achieved by
pointing the package management system at one of Debian's many HTTP mirrors. Due to
the nature of the included updates, in this case it is recommended to follow the
instructions listed in [DSA-4371](https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4371).
