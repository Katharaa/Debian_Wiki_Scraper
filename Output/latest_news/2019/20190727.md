DebConf19 closes in Curitiba and DebConf20 dates announced
==========================================================


**July 27th, 2019**



Today, Saturday 27 July 2019, the annual Debian Developers
and Contributors Conference came to a close.
Hosting more than 380 attendees from 50 different countries over a
combined 145 event talks, discussion sessions,
Birds of a Feather (BoF) gatherings, workshops, and activities,
[DebConf19](https://debconf19.debconf.org) was a large success.




The conference was preceded by the annual DebCamp held 14 July to 19 July
which focused on individual work and team sprints for in-person collaboration
toward developing Debian and host to a 3-day packaging workshop
where new contributors were able to start on Debian packaging.




The [Open Day](https://debconf19.debconf.org/news/2019-07-20-open-day/)
held on July 20, with over 250 attendees, enjoyed presentations
and workshops of interest to the wider audience, a Job Fair with booths from
several of the DebConf19 sponsors and a Debian install fest.




The actual Debian Developers Conference started on Sunday 21 July 2019.
Together with plenaries such as the traditional 'Bits from the DPL',
lightning talks, live demos
and the announcement of next year's DebConf
([DebConf20](https://wiki.debian.org/DebConf/20) in Haifa, Israel),
there were several sessions related to the recent release of Debian 10 buster
and some of its new features, as well as news updates on several projects and
internal Debian teams, discussion sessions (BoFs) from the language, ports,
infrastructure, and community teams,
along with many other events of interest regarding Debian and free software.




The [schedule](https://debconf19.debconf.org/schedule/)
was updated each day with planned and ad-hoc activities introduced by attendees
over the course of the entire conference.




For those who were not able to attend, most of the talks and sessions were
recorded for live streams with videos made,
available through the
[Debian meetings archive website](https://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2019/DebConf19/).
Almost all of the sessions facilitated remote participation via IRC messaging
apps or online collaborative text documents.




The [DebConf19 website](https://debconf19.debconf.org/)
will remain active for archival purposes and will continue to offer
links to the presentations and videos of talks and events.




Next year, [DebConf20](https://wiki.debian.org/DebConf/20) will be held in Haifa, Israel,
from 23 August to 29 August 2020.
As tradition follows before the next DebConf the local organizers in Israel
will start the conference activites with DebCamp (16 August to 22 August),
with particular focus on individual and team work toward improving the
distribution.




DebConf is committed to a safe and welcome environment for all participants.
During the conference, several teams (Front Desk, Welcome team and Anti-Harassment team)
are available to help so both on-site and remote participants get their best experience
in the conference, and find solutions to any issue that may arise.
See the [web page about the Code of Conduct in DebConf19 website](https://debconf19.debconf.org/about/coc/)
for more details on this.
