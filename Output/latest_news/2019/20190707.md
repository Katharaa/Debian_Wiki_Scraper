Debian Edu / Skolelinux Buster â a complete Linux solution for your school
============================================================================


**July 7th, 2019**



Do you have to administrate a computer lab or a whole school network?
Would you like to install servers, workstations and laptops which
will then work together?
Do you want the stability of Debian with network services already
preconfigured?
Do you wish to have a web-based tool to manage systems and several
hundred or even more user accounts?
Have you asked yourself if and how older computers could be used?




Then Debian Edu is for you. The teachers themselves or their technical support
can roll out a complete multi-user multi-machine study environment within
a few days. Debian Edu comes with hundreds of applications pre-installed,
but you can always add more packages from Debian.




The Debian Edu developer team is happy to announce Debian Edu 10
Buster, the Debian Edu / Skolelinux release based
on the DebianÂ 10 Buster release.
Please consider testing it and reporting back (<debian-edu@lists.debian.org>)
to help us to improve it further.



About Debian Edu and Skolelinux
-------------------------------



 [Debian Edu, also known as
Skolelinux](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu), is a Linux distribution based on Debian providing an
out-of-the box environment of a completely configured school network.
Immediately after installation a school server running all services
needed for a school network is set up just waiting for users and
machines to be added via GOsaÂ², a comfortable web interface.
A netbooting environment is prepared, so after initial
installation of the main server from CD / DVD / BD or USB stick all other
machines can be installed via the network.
Older computers (even up to ten or so years old) can be used as LTSP
thin clients or diskless workstations, booting from the network without
any installation and configuration at all.
The Debian Edu school server provides an LDAP database and Kerberos
authentication service, centralized home directories, a DHCP server, a web
proxy and many other services. The desktop contains more than 60 educational
software packages and more are available from the Debian archive.
Schools can choose between the desktop environments Xfce, GNOME, LXDE,
MATE, KDE Plasma and LXQt.

Download options, installation steps and manual
-----------------------------------------------



Separate Network-Installer CD images for 64-bit and 32-bit PCs
are available. Only in rare cases (for PCs older than around 12 years) the
32-bit image will be needed. The images can be downloaded at the following
locations:



* <http://get.debian.org/cdimage/release/current/amd64/iso-cd>
* <http://get.debian.org/cdimage/release/current/i386/iso-cd>



Alternatively extended BD images (more than 5 GB large) are
also available. It is possible to set up a whole Debian Edu network without an
Internet connection (all supported desktop environments, all languages supported
by Debian). These images can be downloaded at the following locations:



* <http://get.debian.org/cdimage/release/current/amd64/iso-bd>
* <http://get.debian.org/cdimage/release/current/i386/iso-bd>



The images can be verified using the signed checksums provided in the download
directory.
  

Once you've downloaded an image, you can check that



* its checksum matches that expected from the checksum file; and that
* the checksum file has not been tampered with.



For more information about how to do these steps, read the
[verification guide](https://www.debian.org/CD/verify).




Debian Edu 10 Buster is entirely based on Debian 10 Buster; so the
sources for all packages are available from the Debian archive.




Please note the
[Debian Edu Buster status page](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu/Status/Buster).
for up-to-date information about Debian Edu 10 Buster including
instructions how to use `rsync` for downloading the ISO images.
