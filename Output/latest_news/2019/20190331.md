The Debian Project mourns the loss of Innocent de Marchi
========================================================


**March 31st, 2019**


The Debian Project recently learned that it has lost a member of its
community. Innocent de Marchi passed a few months ago.



Innocent was a math teacher and a free software developer. One of his passions
was tangram puzzles, which led him to write a tangram-like game that he later
packaged and maintained in Debian. Soon his contributions expanded to other
areas, and he also worked as a tireless translator into Catalan.



The Debian Project honors his good work and strong dedication to Debian
and Free Software. Innocent's contributions will not be forgotten, and the
high standards of his work will continue to serve as an inspiration to
others.
