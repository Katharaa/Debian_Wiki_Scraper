Debian at Solutions Linux and FOSDEM
====================================


**January 27th, 2003**


Two exhibitions and conferences covering Free Software and GNU/Linux
will take place during the next couple of days. The Debian project
has been offered to participate in them.



**February 4th - 6th: [Solutions Linux 2003 / Linux Expo France](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0204-linexpo-paris)**,
 Paris, France

 The Debian project will maintain a booth at this conference and
 exhibition, which is the largest Free Software event in
 France. French and Belgian developers will run the booth.

**February 8th - 9th: [Free and Open Source Software Developers' Meeting](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0208-fosdem)**,
 Brussels, Belgium

 FOSDEM is a non-commercial meeting for Free Software developers
 organised by members of the community. Famous speakers from
 around the world are expected. RaphaÃ«l Hertzog will present
 the goals and the current status of Debian-Edu. Furthermore,
 Martin Michlmayr will give a talk about adapting Debian to
 embedded use.


We invite all interested people in that area to attend one of these
conferences, meet Debian developers and users, exchange GnuPG
fingerprints, discuss various topics on Debian and Free Software, and
otherwise participate in our vibrant community.
