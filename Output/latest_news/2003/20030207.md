Debian joins Desktop Linux Consortium
=====================================


**February 7th, 2003**


The Debian Project is a founding member of the [Desktop Linux
Consortium](http://www.desktoplinuxconsortium.org/) (DLC) which was recently founded and will be
incorporated as a non-profit association. A recent [survey](http://www.desktoplinux.com/cgi-bin/survey/survey.cgi?view=results&id=0124200313234) on DesktopLinux.com indicated that Debian is the most
popular GNU/Linux Distribution for the Desktop. The [Debian Desktop](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-desktop/) sub-project is
an example of our continuing efforts to improve Debian for Desktop
GNU/Linux users.


The Desktop Linux Consortium is a vendor-neutral association which is
comprised of both commercial companies and open source organizations
that are developing and shaping GNU/Linux desktop technologies. The
association will help shape the future of GNU/Linux on the desktop,
targeting the needs of corporate, institutional, and home users.
