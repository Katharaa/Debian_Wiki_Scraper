Debian at Conferences in Austria and Brazil
===========================================


**May 31st, 2003**


Two exhibitions and conferences that cover Free Software and GNU/Linux
are taking place during the next couple of days. The Debian project
has been invited to participate in them with various means.



**June 5th - 7th: [2nd LinuxWochen](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0605-linuxwochen)**,
 Vienna, Austria

The Debian project will participate in the Vienna event of the
LinuxWochen roadshow with a booth run by Gerfried Fuchs. He is
also organizing a keysigning party and will give a talk about
the first steps after Debian has been installed freshly on a
machine.



**June 5th - 7th: [International Free Software Convention](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0605-softwarelivre)**,
 Porto Alegre, Brazil

Almost all Brazilian Debian Developers and members of the
Debian-BR project will meet at this convention. Bdale Garbee
and Wichert Akkerman will also deliver a talk.




We invite all interested people in these areas to attend one of these
conferences, meet Debian developers and users, exchange GnuPG
fingerprints, discuss various topics on Debian and Free Software, and
otherwise participate in our vibrant community.
