Debian announces first South American Security Mirror
=====================================================


**March 2nd, 2011**


The Debian project is proud to announce the availability of the first
official `security.debian.org` mirror in South America. `security.debian.org`
carries all the security updates of the stable and oldstable releases.




In combination with the GeoDNS feature used by Debian, this
should speed up downloads for our users in that geographical area
drastically. This is a welcome improvement in the worldwide coverage of
dedicated official `security.debian.org` mirrors, administrated by the
Debian project says Martin Zobel-Helas, member of the Debian System
Administration team.


Debian has many users in South America and we are
happy to help the Debian project with hardware and bandwidth to
distribute locally content that was previously available only in the
northern hemisphere adds Carlos Carvalho of the C3SL.


Hosting of the `security.debian.org` service in Brazil
is provided by the [C3SL](http://www.c3sl.ufpr.br/), or
Centro de Computação Científica e Software
Livre (Center for Scientific Computing and Free Software).


About C3SL
----------


The [C3SL](http://www.c3sl.ufpr.br/) is a research group of
the [Computer Science Department](http://www.inf.ufpr.br/) of the
[Federal University of Paraná](http://www.ufpr.br/) (UFPR), a public university in the city
of Curitiba, Brazil. The group develops both research and
applications/systems with free software. At each term several tens of
undergraduate and graduate students have the opportunity to learn the
technical and philosophical aspects of free software by participating
in several projects. Of particular interest to the Debian community is
Paraná Digital, which deployed Debian and custom packages at all two
thousand public schools of the state of Paraná, serving about
1.5 million students. C3SL also hosts the Debian
official country mirror `ftp.br.debian.org` since 2005.
