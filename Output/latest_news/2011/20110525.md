Debian announces Chinese Mirror
===============================


**May 25th, 2011**


The Debian project is proud to announce the availability of a new primary
mirror in mainland China. The new mirror, [ftp.cn.debian.org](http://ftp.cn.debian.org), will
significantly reduce network latency to the Debian software repositories
and help to raise Debian's profile in China, and is accessible via
IPv6 as well as via IPv4. Besides Debian's package archive, the
mirror also offers Debian's CD and DVD images as well as the
backports archive, and for users of Debian's oldstable release (Lenny), the Debian
volatile archive.


The Debian mirror team worked with Stephen Zhang and Aron Xu to set up the mirror in China. To quote
Aron, this will significantly reduce the lag time when synchronizing with
Debian's ftp-master server. Previously it was common to have a lag time of about
two days between ftp-master and China. With the new primary mirror, the
mirror team has been able to reduce that time to under six hours for push
clients and under twelve hours for passively synchronizing mirrors.


A primary mirror site has good bandwidth, is available 24 hours a day, and
has an easy to remember name of the form ftp.<country code>.debian.org.
Such a mirror is automatically updated whenever there are updates to the Debian
archive.


Hosting of the primary mirror in China is provided by the University of
Science and Technology of China.


Usage of the new ftp.cn.debian.org mirror
-----------------------------------------


CD and DVD images can either be downloaded
[directly from the mirror](http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian-cd/)
or via the tool [jigdo](https://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/).


Users of the current stable release Debian 6.0 Squeeze should
replace their existing /etc/apt/sources.list with the following:



```

deb http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian squeeze main
deb-src http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian squeeze main

deb http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian squeeze-updates main
deb-src http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian squeeze-updates main

deb http://security.debian.org/ squeeze/updates main
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ squeeze/updates main

```

Users of the current oldstable release Debian 5.0 Lenny should
replace their existing /etc/apt/sources.list with the following:



```

deb http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian lenny main
deb-src http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian lenny main

deb http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main
deb-src http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main

deb http://security.debian.org/ lenny/updates main
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ lenny/updates main

```

Add the following optional lines to use packages backported for
Squeeze:



```

deb http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian-backports squeeze-backports main
deb-src http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian-backports squeeze-backports main

```

Or for packages backported for Lenny:



```

deb http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian-backports lenny-backports main
deb-src http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian-backports lenny-backports main

```

Of course users of the current testing and unstable distributions, Wheezy
and Sid, can also use the new mirror.


Please note that after changing the sources.list, users need
to update their package manager's index files, for instance by running
`apt-get update`.
