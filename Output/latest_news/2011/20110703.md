Debian at several conferences
=============================


**July 3rd, 2011**


The Debian Project is pleased to announce that it will be present at
several events in the coming weeks, ranging from developer-oriented
conferences to workshops for users and wannabe developers. As usual,
[upcoming events](https://www.debian.org/events/) are also
listed on our website.


From June 27 to July 3, during [Campus Party 2011](http://campus-party.com.co/)
in BogotÃ¡, Colombia,
[Debian Colombia](https://debiancolombia.org/) invites all to
join the special event Lleva un paquetico en tu corazÃ³n (Keep a
Little Package in Your Heart) during which attendees will work on
bugs and will create Debian packages. It will also be possible to
participate via IRC by joining the channel #debian-co on
irc.debian.org. Further information (in Spanish) is available on [the
wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianColombia/LLevaUnPaqueticoEnTuCorazon_2011).


From July 9 to 14, Debian will be present with a booth at the [Rencontres mondiales du logiciel
libre (Libre Software Meeting)](http://2011.rmll.info/) in Strasbourg, France.
There will be also an interesting workshop animated by Lucas Nussbaum,
long standing Debian Developer, titled [Tutorial
on Creating a Debian Package](http://2011.rmll.info/Tutoriel-de-creation-de-paquet-DEBIAN) during which Lucas will go over all the basic
steps involved when packaging software. The workshop will be on July 11
at 09:40 at Patio 3211. Further information is available on the [coordination
page](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEventsFr/2011/RMLL).


Some Debian contributors will be present at the [Encontro de Software Livre (ENSOL)](http://www.ensol.org.br/)
in JoÃ£o Pessoa, Brazil, from July 20 to 23. There will
also be a Debian-related presentation, but the final program hasn't been
announced yet.


The Debian Project invites all interested persons to attend these events,
ask questions, take a look at Debian 6.0 Squeeze, exchange
GPG fingerprints to boost the web of trust, and get to know the members and
the community behind the Debian Project.
