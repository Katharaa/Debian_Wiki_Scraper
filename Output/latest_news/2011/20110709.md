Community Distribution Patent Policy FAQ now available
======================================================


**July 9th, 2011**


The Debian Project is pleased to announce the availability of
the [Community Distribution Patent Policy
FAQ](https://www.debian.org/reports/patent-faq), a document meant to educate Free Software developers, and especially
distribution editors, about software patent risks.


The FAQ has been prepared by lawyers
at [Software Freedom Law Center](http://www.softwarefreedom.org)
(SFLC) at the request of and with input from the Debian Project. While the
document does not constitute legal advice, it provides insights on dealing with
software patents, which might be applicable to other community-driven Free
Software distributions.


The Debian Project maintains a critical stance towards software patents: we
consider software patents a threat to Free Software and we believe they provide
no advantages in promoting software innovation.


At the same time, given the *de facto* possibility of patenting
software related ideas in several countries around the world, it is important
for Free Software developers and distributors to neither underestimate nor
overestimate software patent issues. Patent FUD is a serious problem, as is the risk of
patent aggression against Free Software, said Eben Moglen, founding
director of the Software Freedom Law Center. SFLC is pleased to work with
Debian to help volunteers for community distributions everywhere understand the
real risks, and real solutions, without being disheartened by fear,
uncertainty, and doubt.


We believe that the [Community
Distribution Patent Policy FAQ](https://www.debian.org/reports/patent-faq) helps in that respect and we are glad to
make it available to others. Debian, as many other community distributions,
has often had troubles in assessing the risks of patent aggression toward
volunteer developers. I'm glad and thrilled about the opportunity we have of
collaborating with SFLC to shed some light on these matters. said Stefano
Zacchiroli, Debian Project Leader. We will do our best to disseminate our
findings, in a humble attempt to minimize the damages that software patents,
and some of their myths, cause every day to Free Software.
