Debian volatile replaced by new updates suite
=============================================


**February 15th, 2011**


The Debian Volatile archive is discontinued starting from the upcoming
Debian release 6.0 (Squeeze). It is replaced by the suite
squeeze-updates on the official mirrors. Its management will move to the
Debian Release Team, who already manage regular updates to Debian stable and
oldstable.


The squeeze-updates suite is carried by all [official mirrors](https://www.debian.org/mirror/list) just like Squeeze
itself. To use it, a snippet such as the following can be used in
`/etc/apt/sources.list`:



```

deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian squeeze-updates main

```

Announcements about stable updates pushed through squeeze-updates will be
published on [debian-stable-announce@lists.debian.org](https://lists.debian.org/debian-stable-announce/).
To subscribe please visit its [web page](https://lists.debian.org/debian-stable-announce/).


This suite will contain updates that satisfy one of the following
criteria:


* The update is urgent and not of a security nature. Security updates will
 continue to be pushed through the security archive. Examples include
 packages broken by the flow of time (c.f. spamassassin and the year 2010
 problem) and fixes for bugs introduced by point releases.
* The package in question is a data package and the data must be updated in a
 timely manner (e.g. tzdata).
* Fixes to leaf packages that were broken by external changes (e.g. video
 downloading tools and tor).
* Packages that need to be current to be useful (e.g. clamav).


These updates will also be included in the next stable point release after
the announcement. Regular updates not fitting the criteria above will be
pushed through point releases according to the rules of the Stable Release
Management.
