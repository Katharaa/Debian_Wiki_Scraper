Debian derivatives census
=========================


**January 24th, 2011**


The Debian Project would like to invite representatives of distributions
derived from Debian to participate in a [census of Debian
derivatives](https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census).
In addition we would like to invite representatives of distributions
derived from Debian to join the [Debian derivatives](https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives) [front](https://wiki.debian.org/DerivativesFrontDesk) [desk](https://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100629).
Debian encourages members of derivative distributions to contribute
their ideas, patches, bug reports to Debian and to the upstream
developers of software included in Debian.


By participating in the census you will increase the visibility of your
derivative within Debian, provide Debian contributors with a contact
point and a set of information that will make it easier for them to
interact with your distribution. Representatives of distributions
[derived from
Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DerivativeTeam/Derivatives) are encouraged to get their distribution added to
the [Ubuntu
Derivative Team wiki page](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DerivativeTeam/Derivatives).


By participating in the Debian derivatives front desk you can support
other Debian derivatives, share your experience with other Debian
derivatives and with Debian contributors and benefit from the experience
of other Debian derivatives. Debian encourages representatives from all
derivatives to join the [mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/) and [IRC channel](irc://irc.debian.org/debian-derivatives).
Future plans for the Debian derivatives census include keeping track of
Debian derivatives, addition of more information useful to Debian
contributors, inclusion of machine-readable information and subsequent
integration of information about derivatives into Debian infrastructure.


About Debian
------------



The Debian Project was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock to be a truly
free community project. Since then the project has grown to be one of
the largest and most influential open source projects. Over three
thousand volunteers from all over the world work together to create and
maintain Debian software. Translated into over 65 languages, and
supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the
universal operating system.
