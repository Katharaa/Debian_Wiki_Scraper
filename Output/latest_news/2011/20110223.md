The Debian Project is happy to announce that it will again be

again be a present as special guest at the booth of [Univention GmbH](http://www.univention.de/en/), whose motto this year is
 Open source keeps the promises of the cloud and which can be found in
[hall 2](http://maps.messe.de/ipar?fid=007&mapType=overview&hallId=2&sizeX=415&sizeY=415&lang=en)
[stand
D36](http://maps.messe.de/ipar?fid=007&mapType=detail&hallId=2&standId=D36&sizeX=415&sizeY=415&lang=en).


Members of the project will be available for questions and discussions
and demonstrate new features of the recently released Debian 6.0
Squeeze, including the new port to the kernel of the FreeBSD
project. Visitors will also have the opportunity to bring USB thumb drives or blank CDs in order to get a free copy of Debian 6.0.


In addition some of Squeeze's new features will be presented
in a short talk at the [Univention
Open Source-BÃ¼hne](http://www.univention.de/univention/termine/cebit-2011/open-source-buehne/) on Tuesday the 1st of March at 13:30 and again

open their Podcast on Saturday the 5th of March with interviews with Debian
Developers and Press Officers Meike Reichle and Alexander
Reichle-Schmehl.


We would like to thank our sponsors, notably [Univention GmbH](http://www.univention.de/en/) and [Deutsche Messe AG](http://messe.de) for again sponsoring Debian's presence at
