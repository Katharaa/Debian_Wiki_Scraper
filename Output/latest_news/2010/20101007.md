Debian to be at the Society for Neuroscience meeting
====================================================


**October 7th, 2010**


The Debian project is pleased to announce its presence at the [Society for Neuroscience meeting](http://www.sfn.org/am2010/)
(SfN2010) that will take place November 13-17 in San Diego, USA. Debian
will present the upcoming release Debian 6.0 Squeeze and demonstrate
its utility as a robust and versatile research environment for
neuroscience. Booth visitors will have the opportunity to meet with
developers of neuroscience research software, and to get information on
available software and recommendations for deployment strategies in
research laboratories. Members of the [NeuroDebian](http://neuro.debian.net) team will be available to
discuss the advantages of integrating research software into the Debian
operating system.


If you are going to SfN2010, come talk to us at [booth #3815](http://www.expocadweb.com/2010sfn/ec/forms/attendee/index.aspx?content=vbooth&id=1153).

The Debian Project was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock to be a truly

the largest and most influential open source projects. Over three
thousand volunteers from all over the world work together to create and
maintain Debian software. Translated into over 30 languages, and
supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the
universal operating system.
