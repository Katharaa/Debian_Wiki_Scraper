Updated Debian GNU/Linux: 5.0.7 released
========================================


**November 27th, 2010**


The Debian project is pleased to announce the seventh update of its
stable distribution Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 (codename "lenny"). This update
mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable release,
along with a few adjustment to serious problems.


Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of Debian
GNU/Linux 5.0 but only updates some of the packages included. There is
no need to throw away 5.0 CDs or DVDs but only to update via an
up-to-date Debian mirror after an installation, to cause any out of date
packages to be updated.


Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have
to update many packages and most updates from security.debian.org are
included in this update.


New CD and DVD images containing updated packages and the regular
installation media accompanied with the package archive respectively will
be available soon at the regular locations.


Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
aptitude (or apt) package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to
one of Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors. A comprehensive list of
mirrors is available at:

The Debian Installer has been updated to incorporate a new kernel containing
a number of important fixes.

updated kernel included in this release of the Installer does not incorporate the
security fixes released in DSA 2110-1. DSA 2126-1, which has just been released,
includes the updates from both DSA 2110-1 and the linux-2.6 packages
from this point release and will be included in the installed system assuming
that updates from the security repositories are selected during installation.
