After logging in
----------------


After logging in, please fill in at least the General,
Contact and Travelt tabs reachable through the
Registration details button on the bar on the left of the page.
Please pay special attention to the DebConf and DebCamp boxes on the
General tab. You need to select at least the I want to attend this
conference checkbox or your registration won't be valid.


Note to users who have an account from previous years: We did our best to
make sure you do not have to re-enter all your personal data again, just
the conference-specific changes. But please check carefully whether the
data kept from your previous registration is still valid, and update it if
appropriate.


After making changes in the conference management system, please reload
the page from the server to check that your changes were properly recorded
â€” a few attendees have had trouble with certain web browsers not
uploading the data they had entered.
