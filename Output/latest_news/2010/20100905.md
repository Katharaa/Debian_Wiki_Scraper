Backports service becoming official
===================================


**September 5th, 2010**


The Debian Project is proud to announce that the backports service,
previously available at [www.backports.org](http://www.backports.org/)
is now an official Debian service available at
[backports.debian.org](https://backports.debian.org/).


Backports are packages from the testing distribution recompiled for the
current stable (or even oldstable) release to provide users of the stable
distribution with new versions of certain packages, like the Linux kernel,
the Iceweasel browser or the OpenOffice.org suite, without sacrificing
the overall stability of the system.


The archive currently has 528 packages backported for the Lenny distribution.
As the infrastructure to accept packages for the upcoming
Squeeze release is already in place, this allows Debian Installer images to
configure the backports repository by default without generating errors
on user systems. The service for Squeeze will be enabled at a later
date, after the release.


Because of limitations in the Debian Bug Tracking System, any bugs
relevant to backported packages still have to be reported to the
[debian-backports](https://lists.debian.org/debian-backports/) list, which have now also been moved to lists.debian.org.


Informations on how to use the backports service are available at the
new [backports
website](https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/). Users of the old backports service should change their
sources.list to point to deb
http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports lenny-backports main contrib
non-free (or one of its mirrors). Please also note, that with the
integration into Debian's infrastructure the GPG key used to sign the
backports repository has been changed to Debian's official FTP-master
key.


About www.backports.org
-----------------------


The backports service at
[www.backports.org](http://www.backports.org/) was originally
started by Debian Developer Norbert Tretkowski with much support from
[team(ix)](http://www.teamix.net/). It was later continued and
improved by Debian Developers Alexander Wirt (organisation) and JÃ¶rg
Jaspert (technical support) to host over 500 backported
packages for various architectures.  

We would like to thank team(ix) for providing a good home for this service
for all these years.
