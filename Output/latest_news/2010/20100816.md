Debian celebrates its 17th birthday
===================================


**August 16th, 2010**


The Debian Project is pleased to mark the 17th anniversary of its start.
As the [official project history states](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/intro): The Debian Project was
officially founded by Ian Murdock on August 16th, 1993. At that time,
the whole concept of a distribution of Linux was new. Ian intended
Debian to be a distribution which would be made openly, in the spirit
of Linux and GNU.


Over the last seventeen years Debian has grown significantly.
Initiated as a small project with just a handful of developers
it now has more than 1000 contributors from many corners
of the globe. Documentation has been written in numerous languages,
and it now has tens of thousands of software packages, all following
the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines).


Thanks to the contributions of individual developers, translators,
graphic designers, system administrators, users and many others,
Debian continues to thrive in the wider Free Software ecosystem.
Debian is used by a number of derivative distributions that further
expand the reach of Debian's software and Debian's philosophy of
putting the user first.


Under the auspices of [Software In the Public Interest](https://www.spi-inc.org/about/) and through
the [Debian Partners program](https://www.debian.org/partners/) Debian continues to work with some of
the largest names in hardware and software development. Debian has
always striven to support a broad range of hardware with high-quality,
well tested software and continues to work with numerous partners in
various industries to do so. Debian is also widely used in the
computational and engineering disciplines in areas such as astronomy,
bioinformatics, and physics.


The Debian Project continues to welcome contributions in all forms,
from users to developers, encouraging people to download, use, modify,
and distribute its source code in the hopes that it is useful. The
project will release Debian 6.0, code named Squeeze, at some point
this year once the hard work of fixing release critical bugs is
finished. In the spirit of the Free Software community, Debian
welcomes everyone to participate in this and all of Debian's
activities and looks forward to the next seventeen years.


Debian users are invited to use <http://thank.debian.net/> to express their
gratitude and submit congratulations.
