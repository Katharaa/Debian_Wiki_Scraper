Paris Mini-DebConf 2010
=======================


**September 8th, 2010**


Debian France is organizing the first Paris Mini-DebConf. This event
will welcome everyone with an interest in the Debian project for a
series of talks and workshops about Debian. Allowing users, contributors
and developers to meet each other is also one of the main goals of this
event. We are especially looking forward to meeting Debian developers
from around the world :)


The Paris Mini-DebConf 2010 will be held at Université Paris Diderot -
Paris 7, Paris, France, on October 30 and 31.


Further information is in the [Paris Mini-DebConf website](http://fr2010.mini.debconf.org/). If you
wish to attend, it is \*mandatory\* to add some information about yourself
to this page because of University security.


We are in the process of defining the talks and workshops. If you wish
to contribute, please let us know by [dropping an email](mailto:chaica@ohmytux.com) or describing
your talk/workshop in the [DebConf wiki](http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Miniconf-Paris/2010)
before September 30. Most of the talk will be in French, but you're welcome
to submit talk proposals in English.


The event wouldn't have been possible without the support of generous
sponsors who have donated money and other needed facilities. We hereby
thank:
