Bug Squashing Party
-------------------


In order to help Debian towards the release of Squeeze, a Bug Squashing Party
will be held during LSM/RMLL.


Even if you are not a Debian developer, as long as you are interested in
helping Debian to get all the open release-critical bugs fixed, you're welcome
at the BSP. There will be enough developers around to sponsor your NMUs. 


There are some more information about [BSPs](https://people.debian.org/~vorlon/rc-bugsquashing.html) and [RC](https://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/)-Bugsquashing.


Coordination for the BSP is done on the [wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/BSP2010/Bordeaux).


About LSM/RMLL
--------------


2010 Libre Software Meeting is a free (as a beer and as a speech) and non

Software and its uses. The LSM goal is to provide a place for exchange between
Free Software developers, users and stakeholders.


LSM has been organized this year in Bordeaux from 6th to 11th of July, 2010 by a set
of local LUGs and organizations with the help of several public and private
sponsors.

About Debian
------------


The Debian Project was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock to be a truly
free, community project. Since then the project has grown to be one of
the largest and most influential open source projects. Over three
thousand volunteers from all over the world work together to create and
maintain Debian software. Translated into over 30 languages, and
supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the
universal operating system.
