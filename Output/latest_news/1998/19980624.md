Debian v2.0 ("Hamm") Beta Test
==============================


**June 24th, 1998**


Though significantly delayed, Debian 2.0 (Hamm) has officially been released
as beta for the i386 and m68k architectures. The packages on ftp.debian.org
are up to date and ready for downloads. Mirror sites are busy catching up on
the last few changes and should be complete by the end of the day (Thursday
morning at the absolute latest).
Debian 2.0 marks the move from the older libc5 to the newer libc6. Since
this is a significant change, we took a long time to make sure everything
was working correctly.


Changes to Hamm are restricted to important bug fixes so you should encounter
relatively few changes between now and the official release. I would
encourage those interested to go ahead with the Debian 1.3 (Bo) to 2.0
upgrade. This final bit of testing should help eliminate the remaining
upgrade/install problems likely to be encountered.


Debian distributions for Alpha, Sparc, and PowerPC are also available under
the unstable tree. They will likely release with Debian 2.1.


To avoid problems in just upgrading packages via dpkg, dselect, or dftp (due
to possible libc5/libc6 conflicts), it is recommended that the following
upgrade procedure be followed. This document can be found at
<http://bhmit1.home.ml.org/deb/faq>
and

Q: How do I upgrade from an earlier version of Debian?  

A: There are several methods:


1. autoup.sh — This is a script that will upgrade the programs in
 the correct order, even download the deb's for you. Because of
 the continuing changes to the archive, a tar archive of the
 packages that were available at the time autoup.sh was last
 released is provided.
 Versions are available at:  

 ../../releases/hamm/autoup/ (dead link) the current site  

<http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/>  

<http://debian.vicnet.net.au/autoup/>  

 http://www.uk.debian.org/releases/hamm/autoup (dead link)
 (ftp: also okay)
2. apt-get — This is the command line part of Debian's future
 package manager. It knows how to order packages and will
 download them from a local archive, http, and ftp sites. It is
 able to merge the info from several sites, so you can use your
 cd, an up to date mirror, and a non-us site for the best mix of
 speed, variety, and recentness (if you can't tell, I like this
 one). Just run apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade. The bo
 version is at: <https://www.debian.org/~jgg/>
 and [on the current site](https://www.debian.org/releases/hamm/apt-get.gz).
 The hamm version is in project/experimental.
3. Do it by hand. There is a howto at:
 <http://www.gate.net/~storm/FAQ/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html>
 but the autoup.sh simply automates this, so most users won't
 want to do this.
