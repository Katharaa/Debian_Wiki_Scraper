New Debian Mailing List Set Up: debian-security-announce
========================================================


**May 23rd, 1998**


Debian-security-announce is a new mailing-list, dedicated to the
broadcasting of Debian Security Advisories. The advisories will document
security vulnerabilities in the current versions of Debian and provide
fixes, either as updated Debian packages to fetch and install or as
instructions for working around the security problem.
The list is low-volume and digital (PGP) signatures are used for
moderation, so subscribing to it will not add a single piece of spam to
your mailbox. We encourage everyone to subscribe.
To subscribe:

 send email to [debian-security-announce-REQUEST@lists.debian.org](mailto:debian-security-announce-REQUEST@lists.debian.org)
 with the single word 'subscribe' as the subject of the mail.
