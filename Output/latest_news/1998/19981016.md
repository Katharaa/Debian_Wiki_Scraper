"Linux Actual" includes Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' CDs
=======================================================


**October 16th, 1998**


The Spanish magazine Linux Actual is currently the only magazine for
Spanish speakers dedicated to Linux. In its September issue it features
three articles on Debian GNU/Linux entitled An Introduction to Debian,
The Debian package system, and Installation of Debian 2.0. It also
includes two CDs with the official Debian GNU/Linux 2.0r1b1 binary and
source distributions.


This is a chance for Spanish Linux users to try Debian 2.0 since Spanish
CD vendors currently only ship Debian 1.3.1 CDs.


Linux Actual is also shipped overseas to South America countries.
Previous issues of the magazine are available from:
