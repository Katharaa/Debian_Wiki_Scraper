Debian Powers 512 Node Cluster into Book of Records
===================================================


**December 11th, 1998**


Over 512 computers were assembled for the CLOWN (CLuster Of Working Nodes)
system that ran on the night of December 5-6. This cluster used a modified
version of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution (reduced in size to a mere 16
MB, and boot script modifications) to run a combination of PVM (Parallel
Virtual Machine) and several application programs. These programs included
povray (a ray tracing program used to calculate frames for a film), Cactus,
a program that solves the Einstein Equations, which are ten non-linear joint
hyperbolic-elliptical partial differential equations. These are used to
describe Black Holes, Neutron Stars, etc. and are among the most complex in
the field of mathematical Physics.
