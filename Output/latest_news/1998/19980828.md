### What is Hamm-JP?


Hamm-JP is a set of add-on packages for Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 Hamm.
It completely conforms to the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG),
which guarantee Hamm-JP to be 100% free software.


Hamm-JP is comprised of over 210 precompiled binary packages, including:


* X Windows System with TrueType font support
* Libc6 featuring improved multibyte character support
* Manual pager with Japanese support
* X Windows System with TrueType font support
* and many more!


Also it contains a lot of free software from Japan such as


* Ruby, a newly-developed object-oriented script language
* Kinput2, the Kanji input method for X11
* MagicPoint(mgp), an X11 based presentation tool
* and more!


You can easily enhance your Debian system by installing Hamm-JP!


Although at this time Hamm-JP is released as an independent add-on,
in the future all of Debian JP products will be contributed to
Debian GNU/Linux itself. Some packages have already become part
of the standard Debian distribution.


Hamm-JP is primarily compiled for Japanese Debian users, but
most packages are very useful for non-Japanese speakers as well.


Debian documentation written in or translated into Japanese
is also available on the Debian JP web site
<http://www.debian.or.jp/>.
