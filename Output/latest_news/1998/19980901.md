News Mailing List debian-news created
=====================================


**September 1st, 1998**


A new mailing list debian-news has been created for dissemination of news
about the project that is does not need to be distributed as widely as posts
to debian-announce are. debian-news list will carry announcements that
include news articles about Debian, books that are about Debian or include
the distribution, and other miscellaneous Debian related news items that
people may find interesting.


News items from both debian-announce and debian-news will appear in the News
section of the Debian web page.


The first few news items will be cross posted to both lists to allow people
to subscribe to the new list should they choose to do so.
