New SPI Web Pages
=================


**October 29th, 1998**


### Intro


Software in the Public Interest, Inc. is pleased to announce its new web
pages. They can be found at <https://www.spi-inc.org/>. SPI is a non profit organization that was founded
to help projects in developing software for the community. Several projects are
currently being supported through monetary and hardware donations that have been
made to SPI. As SPI is a non profit organization, all donations to it and the
projects it supports are tax deductible.
### Project


Projects that are affiliated with and receive support from SPI are:
* [Berlin](http://www.berlin-consortium.org/)* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)* [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/)* [Linux Standard Base](http://www.linuxbase.org/)* [Open Source](http://opensource.org/)* [Open Hardware](http://www.openhardware.org/)


These projects use the monetary and legal infrastructure available to them
through SPI to accomplish their individual goals. SPI serves as a guiding
organization only, and does not actively control any of the projects it is
affiliated with.
### Trademarks


SPI currently owns several trademarks and certification marks. Although
these trademarks are owned by SPI, they are managed by the projects that
they are associated with.
The Open Source Certification Mark is managed by Eric Raymond on behalf of
the free software community.
The Open Hardware Certification Mark is managed by Vincent Renardias.
The Debian Trademark is managed by Debian.
