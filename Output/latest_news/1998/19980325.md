Code freeze (and rumours)
=========================


**March 25th, 1998**


The following is a message from the leader of Debian, Ian Jackson:

> 
> The codefreeze for Debian 2.0, the libc6 system, is now in place,
> and alpha and beta testing will start very soon.
> 
> 
> There has been some confusion regarding Bruce Perens's relationship
> with SPI (Software in the Public Interest, Debian's support and
> umbrella organization). Bruce is the President of SPI, and felt he
> was unhappy with certain aspects of the Debian Project's work. Ian
> Murdock, Tim Sailer and I — the other board members of SPI — are
> currently discussing with Bruce the future direction of SPI, and SPI's
> relationship with Debian, and there is an ongoing discussion within
> the Debian Project about these issues.
> 
> 
> However, this will not distract us from our progress towards releasing
> 2.0. The Debian Project has a long tradition of apparent political
> instability shortly before making releases, so you can be optimistic!
