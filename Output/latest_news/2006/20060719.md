Dzongkha Version of Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 launched
=================================================


**July 19th, 2006**


The Information and Communication minister of the Royal Government of
Bhutan, Lyonpo Leki Dorji, launched DzongkhaLinux, an entirely
localised GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian GNU/Linux 3.1. This
is the first operating system that fully supports the country's
national language and which has been developed in Bhutan.


The Bhutan Department of Information Technology chose Debian for its
high versatility and reliability as well as the guarantee to always
remain 100Â % Free Software. DzongkhaLinux developers have already
contributed back their translations and development (fonts, input
methods...) to both Debian and end-user applications, such as GNOME,
OpenOffice.org and the Mozilla.


The development of DzongkhaLinux was supported by the International
Development Research Center, from Canada, and the PANl10n project,
aimed at bringing localised computer use in several Asian countries.
The system consists of one CD which can be either installed or used as
a live system.


Recent laws in the country have enforced the use of the national
language in all official events and all official communication.
DzongkhaLinux is the first opportunity for the entire Bhutanese
population to join the information and communication age, using their
own language.


About Bhutan
------------


The Kingdom of Bhutan is a landlocked South Asian nation
situated between India and Tibet, People's Republic of China,
and is often described as the last surviving traditional
Himalayan Buddhist culture. The official
language is Dzongkha, a language from the Sino-Tibetan family. Bhutan
is very committed to preserve its local culture and traditions.


About Debian
------------


Debian GNU/Linux is a free operating system, developed by more than a
thousand volunteers from all over the world who collaborate via the
Internet. Debian's dedication to Free Software, its non-profit nature,
and its open development model make it unique among GNU/Linux
distributions.


The Debian project's key strengths are its volunteer base, its dedication
to the Debian Social Contract, and its commitment to provide the best
operating system possible.
