Upcoming Release of Debian GNU/Linux 4.0
========================================


**July 24th, 2006**


The Debian project confirms December 2006 as the date for the next
release of its distribution which will be named Debian GNU/Linux 4.0
alias 'etch'. This will be the first official release to include the
AMD64 architecture. The distribution will be released synchronously
for 11 architectures in total.


At this stage, the upcoming release will ship with Linux 2.6.17 as its
default kernel. This kernel will be used across all architectures and
on the installer. A later version may be selected during a review in
October.


New features of this release include the GNU Compiler Collection 4.1
as default compiler. X.Org will replace XFree86 as implementation of
the X Window System X11. Secure [APT](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt) will add extra
security by easily
supporting strong cryptography and digital signatures to validate
downloaded packages.


Bug Squashing Parties
---------------------


A number of real-life bug squashing parties will happen before the new
distribution is released in order to squash as many of the open
release-critical bugs as possible. They will be held in different
cities so that many people can participate in real-life.


Interested people who cannot join the developers in the respective
cities are invited to join the #debian-bugs channel on irc.debian.org
and participate online.
