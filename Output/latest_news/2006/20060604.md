Debian IRC Network moves to OFTC
================================


**June 4th, 2006**


Starting with today the Debian IRC host alias irc.debian.org directs
to irc.oftc.net maintained by the Open and Free Technology Community
(OFTC). An increasing number of online discussions has been taken
place in this network already despite irc.debian.org pointing to a
different network. In recognition of that, Debian has decided to move
the irc.debian.org alias over.


The Debian project wishes to thank [Freenode](https://freenode.net/), the well-known Free Software friendly IRC network that
has been providing the IRC service for Debian for the past years.


IRC clients configured to connect to irc.debian.org (as with most IRC
clients packaged in Debian) should need no changes by users wishing to
follow the changeover, but long-running clients may need to be
reconnected or restarted. Developers will be on hand in most of the
common development channels on both networks in case any help is
needed.
