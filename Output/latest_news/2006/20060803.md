Debian GNU/Linux adopted in Extremadura
=======================================


**August 3rd, 2006**


The councillor for Infrastructure and Technological Development, Luis
MillÃ¡n VÃ¡zquez de Miguel, announced that within one year all the
computers of the [Junta of
Extremadura](http://www.juntaex.es/) (government of the autonomous
region of Extremadura, Spain) will run Free Software office tools and
gnuLinEx, the local flavour of Debian GNU/Linux 3.1, as mandatory
operating system. It will be gradually introduced to all
administrative organisations of the Junta of Extremadura.


From now on, all workers of the public administration will also use
Open Document Formats (ISO/IEC DIS 26300) for their office
applications as well as PDF/A (Portable Document Format, ISO
19005-1:2005) for document exchange, when guaranteed unalterable
visualisation is required.


VÃ¡zquez de Miguel explained that at the end of the period all
additional software must be distributed under a free license. "This
is an important initiative that the Junta of Extremadura has been
working on for a long time, accumulating experience and analysing the
impact on our organisation so as to guarantee its success", the
councillor declared. According to VÃ¡zquez de Miguel, Free Software
also improves security, autonomy and rationalises public spending.


Using Open Document Formats will guarantee the conservation of all the
administrative documents for longer periods of time. It will also
improve the relationship with the general public since it's not
obliged to acquire proprietary software to access official documents.
