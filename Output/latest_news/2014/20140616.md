Debian 6 debuts its long term support period
============================================


**June 16th, 2014**


The Debian project is pleased to announce that the Long Term Support
(LTS) infrastructure to provide security updates for Debian GNU/Linux 6.0
(code name squeeze) until February 2016 is now in place. Users of
this version should follow the [instructions from the LTS wiki
page](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Using) to ensure that they get the LTS security updates.


We would like to thank the [volunteers who joined the LTS
team](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Team) and the organizations which expressed their interest to
contribute to the LTS initiative:
[AD&D - IntarS Austria](http://www.intars.at/),
[Deezer](http://www.deezer.com/),
[ÃlectricitÃ© de France](http://www.edf.com/),
[Freeside](http://freeside.biz/),
[Offensive Security](http://www.offensive-security.com/),
[Positive Internet](http://www.positive-internet.com/),
[Seznam.cz](http://www.seznam.cz/),
[Sipwise](http://www.sipwise.com/),
[Univention](http://www.univention.de/),
[University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/)
and all the others who will join them in the coming months.


However, to ensure its success and cover more packages, more help is
needed: organizations benefiting from the extended support period are
encouraged to contribute manpower to the [LTS team](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development).
For organizations that cannot contribute their own workforce to the LTS
team, [Freexian](http://www.freexian.com) â a French company
owned by Debian Developer RaphaÃ«l Hertzog â offered to act as an intermediary
between organizations interested in funding LTS work, and individual Debian
contributors preparing LTS security updates. For more information, see
[Freexian's description
of their proposal](http://www.freexian.com/services/debian-lts.html).


The Debian Project welcomes this initiative, and is generally supportive
of organizations exploring ways to help sustain the LTS project and
Debian in general.


Should Debian 6 LTS be a success, it would be repeated and
generalized so that Debian 7 (wheezy) and Debian 8 (jessie)
would also benefit from Long Term Support.


More information can be found in the [Debian LTS project's wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS).
