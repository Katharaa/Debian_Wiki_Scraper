The Debian Project mourns the loss of Peter Miller
==================================================


**October 20th, 2014**


The Debian Project recently learned that it has lost a member of its
community. Peter Miller died on July 27th after a long battle with
leukemia.


Peter was a relative newcomer to the Debian project, but his
contributions to Free and Open Source Software go back the late
1980s. Peter was significant contributor to GNU gettext as well as being
the main upstream author and maintainer of other projects that ship as
part of Debian, including, but not limited to srecord, aegis and cook.
Peter was also the author of the paper "Recursive Make Considered
Harmful".


The Debian Project honours his good work and strong dedication to
Debian and Free Software. Peter's contributions will not be
forgotten, and the high standards of his work will continue to serve as
an inspiration to others.
