Debian Available Pre-installed on New Computers
===============================================


**December 11th, 1997**


We're happy to announce a computer manufacturer that supports Debian.
[VA Research](http://www.varesearch.com/) is offering Debian
pre-installed at no extra charge on all of the computer systems they sell:
laptops, workstations, and file servers. You can see the products at
<http://www.varesearch.com/>.
VA has donated a system and a high-bandwidth network connection to Debian.
Here's some information on a system on sale this month that includes a
Debian donation.

> 
> We have a new system. It's a VArStation 25 â€” a dual capable Pentium II
> system, available with either one or two 233, 266, or 300Mhz cpus. It's an
> ide based system, and we're pricing the whole thing starting at $2200
> including a Matrox card, 64 megabytes of ram, and a SoundBlaster.
> 
> 
> There are a few upgrades...bigger disk, more ram, better graphics, etc.
> It's a good system because people can start with a single processor and
> some ram, and add a second processor and double their ram later.
> 
> 
> In order to help Debian, we are going to donate 2% of the price of any
> VArStation 25 system ordered in December with Debian pre-installed.
