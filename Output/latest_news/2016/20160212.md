=================================================


**February 12th, 2016**


The Debian [Long Term Support (LTS)](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/)
Team hereby announces that Debian 6.0
(squeeze) support will reach its end-of-life on February 29, 2016,
five years after its initial release on February 6, 2011.


There will be no further security support for Debian 6.0.


The LTS Team will prepare the transition to Debian 7 (wheezy), which
is the current oldstable release. The LTS team will take over support from the
Security Team on April 26, 2016.


Debian 7 will also receive Long Term Support for five years after its
initial release with support ending in May 2018.


Debian and its LTS Team would like to thank all contributing users,
developers and sponsors who are making it possible to extend the life
of previous stable releases, and who have made this LTS a success.
