DebConf16 closes in Cape Town and DebConf17 dates announced
===========================================================


**July 9th, 2016**



Today, Saturday 9 July 2016, the annual Debian Developers
and Contributors Conference came to a close.
With over 280 people attending from all over the world,
and 113 hours of talks in 114 events,
[DebConf16](https://debconf16.debconf.org/) has been hailed
as a success.




Highlights included the
[Open Festival](https://debconf16.debconf.org/open-festival/),
where events of interest to a broader audience were offered (ranging from topics
specific to Debian to a wider appreciation of the open and maker movements),
the traditional Bits from the DPL, lightning talks and live demos
and the announcement of next year's DebConf (DebConf17 in Montreal).




For those not able to attend, talks and sessions were recorded and live streamed,
and videos are being made available at the
[Debian meetings archive website](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2016/debconf16).




Next year, DebConf will be held in Montreal, Canada, from 6 to 12 August 2017.
For the days before DebConf the local organisers will again set up DebCamp,
a session for some intense work on improving the distribution,
and the Debian Day on 5 August 2017, aimed at the general public.




Debian thanks the commitment of numerous
[sponsors](https://debconf16.debconf.org/sponsors/)
to supporting DebConf16, particularly our Platinum Sponsor
[Hewlett Packard Enterprise](http://www.hpe.com/engage/opensource).
