Debian Edu / Skolelinux Bullseye â a complete Linux solution for your school
==============================================================================


**August 15th, 2021**



Are you the administrator for a computer lab or an entire school network?
Would you like to install servers, workstations, and laptops to
work together?
Do you want the stability of Debian with network services already
preconfigured?
Do you wish to have a web-based tool to manage systems and several
hundred or even more user accounts?
Have you asked yourself if and how older computers could be used?




Then Debian Edu is for you. The teachers themselves or their technical support
can roll out a complete multi-user multi-machine study environment within
a few days. Debian Edu comes with hundreds of applications pre-installed,
and you can always add more packages from Debian.




The Debian Edu developer team is happy to announce Debian Edu 11
Bullseye, the Debian Edu / Skolelinux release based
on the DebianÂ 11 Bullseye release.
Please consider testing it and reporting back (<debian-edu@lists.debian.org>)
to help us to improve it further.



About Debian Edu and Skolelinux
-------------------------------



 [Debian Edu, also known as
Skolelinux](https://blends.debian.org/edu), is a Linux distribution based on Debian providing an
out-of-the box environment of a completely configured school network.
Immediately after installation, a school server running all services
needed for a school network is set up just waiting for users and
machines to be added via GOsaÂ², a comfortable web interface.
A netbooting environment is prepared, so after initial
installation of the main server from CD / DVD / BD or USB stick all other
machines can be installed via the network.
Older computers (even up to ten or so years old) can be used as LTSP
thin clients or diskless workstations, booting from the network without
any installation and configuration at all.
The Debian Edu school server provides an LDAP database and Kerberos
authentication service, centralized home directories, a DHCP server, a web
proxy and many other services. The desktop environment contains more than 70
educational software packages and more are available from the Debian archive.
Schools can choose between the desktop environments Xfce, GNOME, LXDE,
MATE, KDE Plasma, Cinnamon and LXQt.



New features for Debian Edu 11 Bullseye

These are some items from the release notes for Debian Edu 11 Bullseye,
based on the Debian 11 Bullseye release.

clients are still supported, now using [X2Go](https://wiki.x2go.org)

compliant with LTSP.
* The Debian Installer's graphical mode is used for iPXE installations.
* Samba is now configured as standalone server with support for SMB2/SMB3.
* DuckDuckGo is used as default search provider for both Firefox ESR and Chromium.

dedicated gateway.


Download options, installation steps and manual
-----------------------------------------------



Official Debian Network-Installer CD images for both 64-bit and 32-bit PCs
are available. The 32-bit image will only be needed in rare cases (for
PCs older than around 15 years). The images can be downloaded at the following
locations:



* <http://get.debian.org/cdimage/release/current/amd64/iso-cd>
* <http://get.debian.org/cdimage/release/current/i386/iso-cd>



Alternatively official Debian BD images (more than 5 GB in size) are also
available. It is possible to set up a whole Debian Edu network without an
Internet connection (including all desktop environments and localization for all
languages supported by Debian).
These images can be downloaded at the following locations:



* <http://get.debian.org/cdimage/release/current/amd64/iso-bd>
* <http://get.debian.org/cdimage/release/current/i386/iso-bd>



The images can be verified using the signed checksums provided in the download
directory.
  

Once you've downloaded an image, you can check that



* its checksum matches that expected from the checksum file; and that
* the checksum file has not been tampered with.



For more information about how to do these steps, read the
[verification guide](https://www.debian.org/CD/verify).




Debian Edu 11 Bullseye is entirely based on Debian 11 Bullseye;
so the sources for all packages are available from the Debian archive.
