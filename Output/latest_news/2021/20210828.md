DebConf21 online closes
=======================


**August 28th, 2021**



On Saturday 28 August 2021, the annual Debian Developers
and Contributors Conference came to a close.




DebConf21 has been held online for the second time, due to the coronavirus
(COVID-19) disease pandemic.




All of the sessions have been streamed, with a variety of ways of participating:
via IRC messaging, online collaborative text documents,
and video conferencing meeting rooms.




With 740 registered attendees from more than 15 different countries and a
total of over 70 event talks, discussion sessions,
Birds of a Feather (BoF) gatherings and other activities,
[DebConf21](https://debconf21.debconf.org) was a large success.




The setup made for former online events involving Jitsi, OBS,
Voctomix, SReview, nginx, Etherpad, a web-based
frontend for voctomix has been improved and used for DebConf21 successfully.
All components of the video infrastructure are free software, and configured through the
Video Team's public [ansible](https://salsa.debian.org/debconf-video-team/ansible) repository.




The DebConf21 [schedule](https://debconf21.debconf.org/schedule/) included
a wide variety of events, grouped in several tracks:



* Introduction to Free Software & Debian,
* Packaging, policy, and Debian infrastructure,
* Systems administration, automation and orchestration,
* Cloud and containers,
* Security,
* Community, diversity, local outreach and social context,
* Internationalization, Localization and Accessibility,
* Embedded & Kernel,
* Debian Blends and Debian derived distributions,
* Debian in Arts & Science
* and other.



The talks have been streamed using two rooms, and several of these activities
have been held in different languages: Telugu, Portuguese, Malayalam, Kannada,
Hindi, Marathi and English, allowing a more diverse audience to enjoy and participate.




Between talks, the video stream has been showing the usual sponsors on the loop, but also
some additional clips including photos from previous DebConfs, fun facts about Debian
and short shout-out videos sent by attendees to communicate with their Debian friends.



The Debian publicity team did the usual Â«live coverageÂ» to encourage participation
with micronews announcing the different events. The DebConf team also provided several
[mobile options to follow
the schedule](https://debconf21.debconf.org/schedule/mobile/).




For those who were not able to participate, most of the talks and sessions are already
available through the
[Debian meetings archive website](https://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2021/DebConf21/),
and the remaining ones will appear in the following days.




The [DebConf21](https://debconf21.debconf.org/) website
will remain active for archival purposes and will continue to offer
links to the presentations and videos of talks and events.




Next year, [DebConf22](https://wiki.debian.org/DebConf/22) is planned to be held
in Prizren, Kosovo, in July 2022.




DebConf is committed to a safe and welcome environment for all participants.
During the conference, several teams (Front Desk, Welcome team and Community team)
have been available to help so participants get their best experience
in the conference, and find solutions to any issue that may arise.
See the [web page about the Code of Conduct in DebConf21 website](https://debconf21.debconf.org/about/coc/)
