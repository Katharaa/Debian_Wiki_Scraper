DebConf23 closes in Kochi and DebConf24 location announced
==========================================================


**September 18th, 2023**



Yesterday, Sunday 17 September 2023, the annual Debian Developers and
Contributors Conference came to a close.




Over 474 attendees representing 35 countries from around the world came
together for a combined 89 events made up of Talks, Discussons, Birds of a
Feather (BoF) gatherings, workshops, and activities in support of furthering
our distribution, learning from our mentors and peers, building our
community, and having a bit of fun.




The conference was preceded by the annual
[DebCamp](https://wiki.debian.org/DebCamp) hacking session held
September 3d through September 9th where Debian Developers and Contributors
convened to focus on their Individual Debian related projects or work in team
sprints geared toward in-person collaboration in developing Debian.
In particular this year Sprints took place to advance development in
Mobian/Debian, Reproducible Builds, and Python in Debian. This year also
featured a BootCamp that was held for newcomers staged by a team of
dedicated mentors who shared hands-on experience in Debian and offered a
deeper understanding of how to work in and contribute to the community.




The actual Debian Developers Conference started on Sunday 10, September 2023.
In addition to the traditional 'Bits from the DPL' talk, the continuous
key-signing party, lightning talks and the announcement of next year's
DebConf24, there were several update sessions shared by internal projects and
teams.
Many of the hosted discussion sessions were presented by our technical
teams who highlighted the work and focus of the Long Term Support (LTS),
Android tools, Debian Derivatives, Debian Installer, Debian Image, and the
Debian Science teams. The Python, Perl, and Ruby programming language teams
also shared updates on their work and efforts.
Two of the larger local Debian communities, Debian Brasil and Debian India
shared how their respective collaborations in Debian moved the project
forward and how they attracted new members and opportunities both in
Debian, F/OSS, and the sciences with their HowTos of demonstrated community
engagement.




The [schedule](https://debconf23.debconf.org/schedule/)
was updated each day with planned and ad-hoc activities introduced by
attendees over the course of the conference. Several activities that were
unable to be held in past years due to the Global COVID-19 Pandemic were
celebrated as they returned to the conference's schedule: a job fair, the
open-mic and poetry night, the traditional Cheese and Wine party, the group
photos and the Day Trips.




For those who were not able to attend, most of the talks and sessions were
videoed for live room streams with the recorded videos to be made available
later through the
[Debian meetings archive website](https://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2023/DebConf23/).
Almost all of the sessions facilitated remote participation via IRC messaging
apps or online collaborative text documents which allowed remote
attendees to 'be in the room' to ask questions or share comments with the
speaker or assembled audience.




DebConf23 saw over 4.3 TiB of data streamed, 55 hours of scheduled talks, 23
network access points, 11 network switches, 75 kg of equipment imported, 400
meters of gaffer tape used, 1,463 viewed streaming hours, 461 T-shirts, 35
country Geoip viewers, 5 day trips, and an average of 169 meals planned per
day.
All of these events, activies, conversations, and streams coupled with our
love, interest, and participation in Debian annd F/OSS certainly made this
conference an overall success both here in Kochi, India and On-line around
the world.




The [DebConf23 website](https://debconf23.debconf.org/)
will remain active for archival purposes and will continue to offer
links to the presentations and videos of talks and events.




Next year, [DebConf24](https://wiki.debian.org/DebConf/24) will be
held in Haifa, Israel.
As tradition follows before the next DebConf the local organizers in Israel
will start the conference activites with DebCamp with particular focus on
individual and team work towards improving the distribution.




DebConf is committed to a safe and welcome environment for all participants.
