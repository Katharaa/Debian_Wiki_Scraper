Debian Chooses A New Logo
=========================


**August 26th, 1999**


Debian has, as the result of a GIMP Logo contest,
 <http://contest.gimp.org/>,
chosen a new logo. The logo was selected by a vote of the Debian developers
(see <https://www.debian.org/vote/>
for more information), and the winning
entry was submitted by Raul M. Silva of onShore, Inc. and can be seen on the
main Debian web pages.
Licenses and conditions for use can be found at
<https://www.debian.org/logos/>.
Regarding the selection of his logo (affectionately known as 'the swirl') by
the Debian project, Raul said, "I'm very pleased that we're able to give
something back to the Debian community. We've been very happy with Debian
GNU/Linux, and have been working with it internally and for our clients for
a number of years now."
As the winner of the contest, Raul receives a debian.org email address as
well as a CD of the latest Debian distribution for the architecture of his
choice. Debian wishes to thank all of the participants in the contest.
