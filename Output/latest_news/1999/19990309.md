Release of Debian 2.1
=====================


**March 9th, 1999**


 Exactly on the revised schedule, at 00:00 GMT, March 9, Debian 2.1
(codenamed slink) was released. Release information is available
[here](https://www.debian.org/releases/slink/).
 The bugs which delayed Debian for one week have been satisfactorily
resolved.
 CD Images have gone final, and should be making their way to
distributors shortly - we have a list of debian vendors
[here](https://www.debian.org/CD/vendors/). Up-to-date raw images will be
available in a few days from
[the SunSITE UK FTP
site](ftp://sunsite.org.uk/sites/debian.hands.com/debian/), which is also rsync accessible at
rsync.sunsite.org.uk::sites/debian.hands.com/debian/.
 Debian can be downloaded for free from any of our
[mirrors](https://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist).
