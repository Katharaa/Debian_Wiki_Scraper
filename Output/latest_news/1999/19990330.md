Debian Touts Integrated SGML Environment
========================================


**March 30th, 1999**


Debian's 2.1 distribution, now released, features integrated SGML,
XML, and DSSSL infrastructure and packages. Debian's innovative SGML
subsystem positions Debian as a premier platform for SGML and XML
developers, offering a complete working tool set for documenters and
markup programmers with no manual setup required.
Features:
* James Clark's jade 1.2.1 and SP suite version 1.3.3,
 enabling validation and formatting of SGML or XML
 [URL:http://www.jclark.com/jade/](http://www.jclark.com/jade/).
 * SGMLOpen shared system catalog integration (no need to manually
 register SGML Public Identifiers or set with environment
 variables).
 * docbook (v3.0) and docbook-stylesheets (v1.13) available, providing
 an industry-standard markup convention
 [URL:http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/](http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/).
 * psgml, which in conjunction with Emacs19, Emacs20, XEmacs19, or
 XEmacs20, provides a professional SGML editing environment.

 * jadetex, combined with jade, facilitates the conversion of SGML to
 PostScript or PDF, for high quality printed output.
 * a host of other SGML, XML, and DSSSL software packages are
 available, including but not limited to sgml-tools, expat,
 sdc, perlsgml, sgmlspm, and dsc.


We believe that Debian's open model of participation and commitment
to system quality (as reflected in the Debian Policy
[URL:https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/)) puts Debian
head-and-shoulders above other commercial or free systems. SGML
integration efforts continue apace in the unstable distribution,
including DocBook 3.1, DocBk XML, TEI, and more DTDs.
