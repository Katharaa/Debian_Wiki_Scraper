Debian booth at the Pluto Meeting, Padova, ITALY
================================================


**September 27th, 1999**


On September 24 & 25 the Pluto Meeting 1999
<http://meeting.pluto.linux.it>
has been held in Padova, ITALY. The Meeting was hosted by the University of
Padova (DEI). Debian was present with a booth kindly offered by the Meeting
organization and sponsored by PROSA <http://www.prosa.it> that lent us
two
machines: an UltraSPARC and an Alpha (both running Debian). A third machine
(an i386 laptop) was present, running potato (Debian 2.2), GNOME and apt.
Almost everyone was amazed by the little box automagically upgrading itself
and installing programs at visitors' requests.



PROSA also printed about 100 Debian t-shirts and donated them to
Debian people who sold them all in just one hour. The t-shirts were
designed (using the free logo) and manufactured by MIXAD
<http://www.mixad.it>. MIXAD donated its work to Debian by charging
PROSA for the cost of the raw materials only. The revenue (about 750
US$) will be donated to SPI <https://www.spi-inc.org>.




The Debian booth was a big success, even if the gnome-mahjong duel was won by
the Red Hat people. Many thanks to the organization, to PROSA and everybody
who
stopped by the booth to talk, hack or ask questions. See you there next year.
