Release of Debian 2.1 delayed one week
======================================


**March 2nd, 1999**


Due to a few unexpected last minute bugs, the release of Debian 2.1 has
been pushed back one week to March 9, 00:00 GMT. The deciding factor was the
discovery that dpkg, our package manager, can fail if a user sets
the locale to something other than the default.
Debian has earned a reputation for rock solid releases and the developers
felt that it was not worth ruining to maintain a deadline.
