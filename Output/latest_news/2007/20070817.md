Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 updated
============================


**August 17th, 2007**


The Debian project is pleased to announce the first update of its stable
distribution Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 (codename etch). This update mainly
adds corrections for security problems to the stable release, along with
a few adjustment to serious problems. The first update also corrects a
few important issues that have been noticed too late in the release
process.


Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of Debian
GNU/Linux 4.0 but only updates some of the packages included. There is
no need to throw away 4.0 CDs or DVDs but only to update against
ftp.debian.org after an installation, in order to incorporate those late
changes.


Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have
to update many packages and most updates from security.debian.org are
included in this update.


New CD and DVD images containing updated packages and the regular
installation media accompanied with the package archive respectively
will be available soon at the regular locations.


Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
aptitude (or apt) package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to
one of Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors. A comprehensive list of
mirrors is available at:



<https://www.debian.org/mirror/list>

Debian-Installer Update
-----------------------


To propagate updated Linux kernel packages to the Debian installer it
has been updated. The new binary interface causes the old netboot and
floppy images to stop working and thus will be rebuilt and distributed
from the regular locations soon. Several USB CD drives that were
previously not detected are now supported. Other changes include an
updated mirror list, a correction for gksu and improved translations.
