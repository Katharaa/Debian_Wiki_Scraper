DebConf20 online closes
=======================


**August 30th, 2020**



On Saturday 29 August 2020, the annual Debian Developers
and Contributors Conference came to a close.




DebConf20 has been held online for the first time, due to the coronavirus
(COVID-19) disease pandemic.




All of the sessions have been streamed, with a variety of ways of participating:
via IRC messaging, online collaborative text documents,
and video conferencing meeting rooms.




With more than 850 attendees from 80 different countries and a
total of over 100 event talks, discussion sessions,
Birds of a Feather (BoF) gatherings and other activities,
[DebConf20](https://debconf20.debconf.org) was a large success.




When it became clear that DebConf20 was going to be an online-only
event, the DebConf video team spent much time over the next months to
adapt, improve, and in some cases write from scratch, technology that
would be required to make an online DebConf possible. After lessons
learned from the MiniDebConfOnline in late May, some adjustments were
made, and then eventually we came up with a setup involving Jitsi, OBS,
Voctomix, SReview, nginx, Etherpad, and a newly written web-based
frontend for voctomix as the various elements of the stack.




All components of the video infrastructure are free software, and the
whole setup is configured through their public
[ansible](https://salsa.debian.org/debconf-video-team/ansible) repository.




The DebConf20 [schedule](https://debconf20.debconf.org/schedule/) included
two tracks in other languages than English: the Spanish language MiniConf,
with eight talks in two days,
and the Malayalam language MiniConf, with nine talks in three days.
Ad-hoc activities, introduced by attendees over the course of the entire conference,
have been possible too, streamed and recorded. There have also been several
team gatherings to [sprint](https://wiki.debian.org/Sprints/) on certain Debian development areas.




Between talks, the video stream has been showing the usual sponsors on the loop, but also
some additional clips including photos from previous DebConfs, fun facts about Debian
and short shout-out videos sent by attendees to communicate with their Debian friends.




For those who were not able to participate, most of the talks and sessions are already
available through the
[Debian meetings archive website](https://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2020/DebConf20/),
and the remaining ones will appear in the following days.




The [DebConf20](https://debconf20.debconf.org/) website
will remain active for archival purposes and will continue to offer
links to the presentations and videos of talks and events.




Next year, [DebConf21](https://wiki.debian.org/DebConf/21) is planned to be held
in Haifa, Israel, in August or September.




DebConf is committed to a safe and welcome environment for all participants.
During the conference, several teams (Front Desk, Welcome team and Community team)
have been available to help so participants get their best experience
in the conference, and find solutions to any issue that may arise.
See the [web page about the Code of Conduct in DebConf20 website](https://debconf20.debconf.org/about/coc/)
for more details on this.
