Debian welcomes diversity
=========================


**June 6th, 2012**



The Debian Project is pleased to announce the availability of
its [diversity statement](https://www.debian.org/intro/diversity),
approved by a [large
majority of the project members](https://www.debian.org/vote/2012/vote_002).




The **technical** side of the Debian Project is already
committed to diversity: we don't accept discrimination against persons,
groups or fields of endeavor in our software
([Debian Free Software
Guidelines, points 5 and 6](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)).
Now, the **community** part of the Debian Project explicitly
welcomes and encourages participation by everyone.




The constructive and fruitful discussion that led to the current
version of this statement was really encouraging, said Francesca
Ciceri, who proposed the initial draft and took a lot of other opinions into account.
I'd like to thank all the people who participated in the drafting process
proposing changes and fixes, explaining different points of view and
approving this initiative, Francesca added.




This statement marks a new stage in the process of welcoming
contributors to our project, said Stefano Zacchiroli, Debian Project Leader.
Community diversity goes hand in hand with community richness.
