DebConf makes in-roads in Central America
=========================================


**July 16th, 2012**



This year's DebConf in Managua took Debian to a new part of the world
which is too little visited by major Free Software events, allowing the project
to reach out to new contributors and learn new perspectives, as well as to
continue its hard work towards the next stable release of Debian.




The conference brought together around 200 attendees from 32 countries, and
helped many people make their first steps in contributing to Debian, including
a large number of enthusiastic new volunteers from countries in Central
America.




98 talks were given, with highlights including:



* [EFI boot methodology](http://penta.debconf.org/dc12_schedule/events/925.en.html)
* [XCP, OpenStack, Debian and the Cloud](http://penta.debconf.org/dc12_schedule/events/867.en.html)
* [FreedomBox Update](http://penta.debconf.org/dc12_schedule/events/848.en.html)
* [Beginners Spanish](http://penta.debconf.org/dc12_schedule/events/945.en.html)



DebConf12 was a wonderful experience and a great opportunity for the local
community to relate closer to the project, the community and the philosophy
behind Debian says Leandro GÃ³mez, from the local team for DebConf12.
This year's conference will definitely bring new contributors for the Debian
project from the Central American region.




Gaudenz Steinlin from the DebConf team said:

I'm very impressed with this year's team of local and Debian organizers who
worked together to produce this vital event in Debian's calendar. I'm excited
to welcome everyone again in Switzerland next year.





DebConf in 2013 will be held in Le Camp, Vaumarcus, Switzerland which will
again be a great opportunity to advance the development of Debian.
