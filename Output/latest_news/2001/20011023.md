Conferences in Luxembourg and Tokyo
===================================


**October 23rd, 2001**


Two exhibitions and conferences are starting tomorrow. The Debian
Project will have a presence at both of them. We are sorry for the
late announcement, though.


We invite all interested people in the respective areas to attend
these events, meet Debian developers and users, exchange GnuPG
fingerprints, discuss various topics on Debian and Free Software, and
otherwise participate in our vibrant community.


October 24th - 25th    **[Linuxdays](https://www.debian.org/events/2001/1024-linuxdays)** (Luxembourg)





 The aim of the Linuxdays is to promote and support the Open
 Source & Free Software movement. This is the first Linux
 conference in Luxembourg.



Oliver Loch will give a talk about Debian GNU/Linux and the
 Debian project, providing an introduction in the philosophy
 behind the project and the operating system.




October 24th - 25th    **[LinuxWorld Conference & Demo](https://www.debian.org/events/2001/1024-linuxworldjp)** (Tokyo, Japan)





 The Debian-JP project will run a booth in the exhibition
 area. On October 25th they are holding a Debian Conference
 in Japan during this event. This conference is sponsored
 by OSDN Japan and its goal is to propagate information
 about Debian in general to people related to Linux.
