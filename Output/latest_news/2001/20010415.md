Running Linux 2.4.x with Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
=============================================


**April 15th, 2001**


Since the new version of the Linux kernel, 2.4.x, was not finished at
the time Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 was created, it was not possible to
adjust the system in order to work with some of the changes in the
kernel.
Adrian Bunk, a Debian developer, maintains an archive of packages that
need to be updated in case you want to run the new kernel on your
potato machine.
These packages are mostly recompiled versions of those packages found
in our `unstable' distribution, so despite Adrian's efforts, we can
not guarantee that everything will work perfectly.
CAUTION: After you have upgraded the modutils package to the one from
this archive, you can no longer run a modular 2.0.x kernel.
For more information, please visit:

<http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/kernel-24.html>

Please read the information on this web page carefully before upgrading!
If you are using APT, add the following lines to your
`/etc/apt/sources.list`:

```

  deb http://people.debian.org/~bunk/debian potato main
  deb-src http://people.debian.org/~bunk/debian potato main

```

Then issue the following commands:

```

  apt-get update
  apt-get -u dist-upgrade

```

This will upgrade all necessary packages.
Please check the list of new packages below if there are new packages
that you need, for example, if you want to use a new feature like ReiserFS,
install the `reiserfsprogs' package.
