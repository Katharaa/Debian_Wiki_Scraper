Debian Project at International Linux Kongress
==============================================


**November 24th, 2001**


The Debian Project has been invited to attend the upcoming
International Linux Kongress. International Linux Kongress is
Europe's one and only developer congress targetting the Linux
community. Linux core development (including kernel, drivers and
libraries) have always been famous topics at Linux Kongress. This
year's congress is held from November 28th to 30th at the [Universiteit Twente](http://www.utwente.nl/) in Enschede, the
Netherlands.


The Debian project has been offered to give a workshop and run a booth
during the congress. The workshop will take place on Wednesday,
November 28th, from 12 o'clock until evening. It will contain both
technical and political issues associated to the Debian Project.


Contrary to regular workshops this one is based on self-modifying
code. Issues discussed within will reflect what the audience would
like to have discussed. A lot of Debian developers will be around
during the workshop, so that all issues should be addressed properly.


Additionally, Thomas Lange will give a talk about the Fully Automatic
Installation (FAI) that he invented. His talk will take place on
Thursday 11:30-12:15.

We invite all interested people to attend this conference, meet Debian
developers and users, exchange GnuPG fingerprints, discuss various
topics on Debian and Free Software, and otherwise participate in our
vibrant community.
