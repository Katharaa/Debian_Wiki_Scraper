Interview with Hurd developer Neal Walfield
===========================================


**November 13th, 2001**


Jeremy Andrews of [KernelTrap](http://kerneltrap.org/) spoke
with Neal Walfield from the GNU/Hurd development team who is also a
Debian developer working on the Hurd port.


From the interview:



> 
> "The Hurd is a radical departure from many UNIX concepts. It is a
>  unique and interesting approach to solving many of the problems
>  found in current operating systems. While it's not yet production
>  grade, it is evolved enough to be quite usable.
> 
> 
> The Hurd is a set of servers that provide similar interfaces to
>  those found in traditional Unix-like kernels. The servers, each
>  designed to do one task or manage one aspect of the system, run in
>  user space thereby isolating them from both the kernel and each
>  other. This offers more power and flexibility to both the
>  administrator and the user and, in doing so, increases system
>  security."
