DMCA Community Declaration
==========================


**July 25th, 2001**


As many of you know, a programmer has been arrested for developing a
utility to circumvent copy protection schemes in some of Adobe's
products. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) makes the practice
of developing (not using, but *developing*!) such utilities illegal.
There is a community declaration regarding the DMCA online which has
already been signed by the Debian Project Leader and SPI president as
well as many other community leaders and members. This declaration
states the basic problems with the DMCA, and addresses why such a law
should not exist.
We urge you to go to the web site of the declaration and, if you agree
with the statements regarding the DMCA, to sign it. The web site is:
