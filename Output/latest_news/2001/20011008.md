Debian Expo and Conference Week in Germany
==========================================


**October 8th, 2001**


This week and the next one is going to be a busy one for the German
part of the Debian Project. There are three exhibitions and
conferences taking place. The Debian Project will have a presence at
all of them.
We invite all interested people in the respective areas to attend
these events, meet Debian developers and users, exchange GnuPG
fingerprints, discuss various topics on Debian and Free Software, and
otherwise participate in our vibrant community.

 The Debian project is going to participate with a Q&A
 panel, maintained by Steffen Evers. A booth and another

It is an exciting week to be a member of the Debian Project; if you
