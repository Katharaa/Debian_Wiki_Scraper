Debian Project at Hispalinux Congress 2001
==========================================


**November 12th, 2001**


The Debian Project was invited to take part in the Hispalinux Congress
2001 which takes place from November 15th to 17th. This congress is a
yearly community meeting of Spanish users and developers of GNU/Linux
and is held in Madrid, Spain.


[More information](https://www.debian.org/events/2001/1115-hispalinux).


A presentation will be given by Javier FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino PeÃ±a in
which he will demonstrate the tools that are used by the Debian
project, such as package pools, CVS servers and our web infrastructure
with a special focus on internationalisation of web-published documents.


A seminar will be held in which it is demonstrated how a Debian
GNU/Linux system could be hardened with regards to security concerns.
Additionally a 'birds of a feather' session will give developers and
users a chance to discuss issues regarding Debian and exchange GnuPG
fingerprints.


We invite all interested people to attend this conference, meet Debian
developers and users, exchange GnuPG fingerprints, discuss various
topics on Debian and Free Software, and otherwise participate in our
vibrant community.

is going to take place in the Netherlands at the end of this month.
