Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 updated (r7)
=================================


**July 13th, 2002**


This is the seventh revision of Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (codename `potato')
which mainly adds security updates to the stable release, along with a
few corrections of serious bugs. Those who frequently update from
security.debian.org won't have to update many packages.


Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
`apt' package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to one of
Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors. A comprehensive list of mirrors is
available at:
