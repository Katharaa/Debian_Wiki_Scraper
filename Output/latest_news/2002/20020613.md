Gibraltar Firewall based on Debian
==================================


**June 13th, 2002**


[Gibraltar](http://www.gibraltar.at/) is a project that
aims to produce a Debian GNU/Linux-based
router and firewall package. This package will be bootable directly
from a CD-ROM, so hard disk installation will not be necessary. This
can actually be a security feature since modifying the filesystem
won't be possible.
Two versions of Gibraltar have been planned for release. The free
version is now available as a testing release. As for the commercial
version, which will come complete with a manual in addition to the
web-interface, the Gibraltar developers are currently preparing for its
1.0 release. Unfortunately, they are unable to give an exact release
date as it still requires more in-house development.
The entire distribution can be downloaded as ISO image, ready to be
burned on CD-ROM, or as source packages. Please find all relevant
files at a mirror, linked from [here](http://www.gibraltar.at/content/product_gibraltar_download_eng.htm).
