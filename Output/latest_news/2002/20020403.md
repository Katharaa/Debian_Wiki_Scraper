Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 updated (r6)
=================================


**April 3rd, 2002**


This is the sixth revision of Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (codename `potato')
which mainly adds security updates to the stable release, along with a
few corrections of serious bugs. Those who frequently update from
security.debian.org won't have to update many packages. However, most
updates from security.debian.org are included in this point release.


Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
`apt' package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to one of
Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors. A comprehensive list of mirrors is
available at:
