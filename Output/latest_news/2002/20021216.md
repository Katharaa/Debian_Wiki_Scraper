Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 updated (r1)
=================================


**December 16th, 2002**


This is the first update of Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (codename ‘woody’)
which mainly adds security updates to the stable release, along with a
few corrections of serious bugs. Those who frequently update from
security.debian.org won't have to update many packages and most
updates from security.debian.org are included in this update.


Please note that this update does not produce a new version of Debian
GNU/Linux 3.0 but only adds a few updated packages to it. There is no
need to throw away 3.0r0 CDs but only to update against ftp.debian.org
after an installation.


Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
‘apt’ package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to one of
Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors. A comprehensive list of mirrors is
available at:



<https://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist>
