Ownership of debian.community domain
====================================


**August 7th, 2022**



The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), under its
Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP),
decided that ownership of the [debian.community](https://debian.community) domain
should be [transferred to the Debian Project](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/case.jsp?case=D2022-1524).




The appointed panel found that the disputed domain name is identical to a trademark
in which the Complainant has rights.




In its decision the panel noted:


> 
> [...] the disputed domain name is identical to the DEBIAN mark, which carries a high risk
> of implied affiliation with the Complainant. [...] Given that the Complainant prominently
> describes Debian on its homepage as a 'community' and not just an operating system,
> [the .community] suffix actually reinforces that the disputed domain name will resolve to a
> site operated or endorsed by [Debian]. The disputed domain name contains no critical or
> other terms to dispel or qualify that false impression.
> 



The panel went on to observe:




> 
> The evidence submitted by the Complainant shows that some posts present the DEBIAN
> mark together with information about a notorious sex cult, notorious sex offenders, and
> enslavement of women, and one post displays photographs of physical branding allegedly on
> victimsâ genital skin. The segues from information about the Complainant to this type of
> information are contrived and the scale of this information is not merely incidental on the
> website. In the Panelâs view, these posts are deliberately intended to create a false
> association between the DEBIAN trademark and offensive phenomena and thereby tarnish
> the mark.
> 



and further concluded that:




> 
> nothing in the Debian Social Contract or elsewhere indicates that the Complainant has ever
> consented to the type of false associations with its mark published by the respondent on its
> website. The Respondent points out that the DEBIAN mark is registered only in respect of
> software. However, while the relevant posts attack members of the Complainant who make
> available DEBIAN software, rather than the software itself, these posts use the mark in
> combination with the disputed domain name in a way that intentionally seeks to create false
> associations with the mark itself.
> 



Debian is committed to the proper use of its trademarks subject to its
[trademark policy](https://www.debian.org/trademark)
and will continue to take enforcement action when that policy is violated.
