DebConf22 closes in Prizren and DebConf23 dates announced
=========================================================


**July 24th, 2022**



Today, Sunday 24 July 2022, the annual Debian Developers
and Contributors Conference came to a close.
Hosting 260 attendees from 38 different countries over a
combined 91 event talks, discussion sessions,
Birds of a Feather (BoF) gatherings, workshops, and activities,
[DebConf22](https://debconf22.debconf.org) was a large success.




The conference was preceded by the annual DebCamp held 10 July to 16 July
which focused on individual work and team sprints for in-person collaboration
towards developing Debian.
In particular, this year there have been sprints to advance development of
Mobian/Debian on mobile, reproducible builds and Python in Debian,
and a BootCamp for newcomers, to get introduced to Debian and have
some hands-on experience with using it and contributing to the community.




The actual Debian Developers Conference started on Sunday 17 July 2022.
Together with activities such as the traditional 'Bits from the DPL' talk,
the continuous key-signing party, lightning talks and the announcement of next year's DebConf
([DebConf23](https://wiki.debian.org/DebConf/23) in Kochi, India),
there were several sessions related to programming language teams such as Python, Perl and Ruby,
as well as news updates on several projects and
internal Debian teams, discussion sessions (BoFs) from many technical teams
(Long Term Support, Android tools, Debian Derivatives, Debian Installer and Images team,
Debian Science...) and local communities (Debian Brasil, Debian India, the Debian Local Teams),
along with many other events of interest regarding Debian and free software.




The [schedule](https://debconf22.debconf.org/schedule/)
was updated each day with planned and ad-hoc activities introduced by attendees
over the course of the entire conference. Several activities that couldn't be
organized in past years due to the COVID pandemic returned to the conference's
schedule: a job fair, open-mic and poetry night, the traditional Cheese and Wine party,
the group photos and the Day Trip.




For those who were not able to attend, most of the talks and sessions were
recorded for live streams with videos made,
available through the
[Debian meetings archive website](https://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2022/DebConf22/).
Almost all of the sessions facilitated remote participation via IRC messaging
apps or online collaborative text documents.




The [DebConf22 website](https://debconf22.debconf.org/)
will remain active for archival purposes and will continue to offer
links to the presentations and videos of talks and events.




Next year, [DebConf23](https://wiki.debian.org/DebConf/23) will be held in Kochi, India,
from September 10 to September 16, 2023.
As tradition follows before the next DebConf the local organizers in India
will start the conference activites with DebCamp (September 03 to September 09, 2023),
with particular focus on individual and team work towards improving the
distribution.




DebConf is committed to a safe and welcome environment for all participants.
