Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 updated
============================


**April 8th, 2009**


The Debian project is pleased to announce the eighth update of its
oldstable distribution Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 (codename etch). This update
mainly adds corrections for security problems to the oldstable release,
along with a few adjustment to serious problems.


Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of Debian
GNU/Linux 4.0 but only updates some of the packages included. There is
no need to throw away 4.0 CDs or DVDs but only to update via an up-to-date
Debian mirror after an installation, to cause any out of date packages to
be updated.


Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have
to update many packages and most updates from security.debian.org are
included in this update.


New CD and DVD images containing updated packages and the regular
installation media accompanied with the package archive respectively
will be available soon at the regular locations.


Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
aptitude (or apt) package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to
one of Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors. A comprehensive list of
mirrors is available at:
