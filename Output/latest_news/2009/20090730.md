Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 Squeeze release goals
==========================================


**July 30th, 2009**


Following up on its decision to adopt the policy of timed release freezes
beginning with the next release of Debian GNU/Linux, the Debian Release
Team has now published their list of release goals for the upcoming
release of Debian GNU/Linux 6.0, code-named Squeeze.


In the light of these goals and also in consideration of the Debian
community's feedback to the release team's initial announcement during
the keynote of this year's DebConf in Caceres, Spain, the Release Team
has additionally decided to revisit its decision on December 2009 as the
proposed freeze date. A new timeline will be announced by the Debian
Release Team in early September.


Luk Claes, Debian Release Manager, underlines the team's commitment to
quality saying In Debian we always strive to achieve the greatest
quality in our releases. The ambitious goals that we have set for
ourselves will help to secure this quality in the upcoming release.


The Debian Release Team - in cooperation with the Debian Infrastructure
Team - plans to include the following goals in the upcoming release:


* Multi-arch support, which will for instance improve the installation
 of 32 bit packages on 64 bit machines
* kFreeBSD support, introducing the first non-linux architecture into
 Debian
* Improved boot performance using dash as the new default shell, and a
 dependency-based boot system that will both clean up the boot process
 and help performance through parallel processing
* A further enhanced Quality Assurance process resulting in higher
 quality packages. This includes:
	+ Clean installation, upgrade and removal of all packages
	+ Automatic rejection of packages failing basic quality checks
	+ Double compilation support
* Preparation for new package formats to help streamline future
 development and to introduce improved compression algorithms
* Removal of obsolete libraries for improved security
* Full ipv6 support
* Large File Support
* Automatic creation of debug packages for the entire archive, a Google
 Summer of Code Project pending integration into the infrastructure
* Move of packages' long descriptions into a separate translated package
 list, which will facilitate their translation and also provide a
 smaller footprint for embedded systems thanks to smaller Packages
 files.
* Better integration of debtags, a system to tag packages with multiple attributes for easier package selection
* Discard and rebuild of binary packages uploaded by maintainers,
 leaving only packages build in a controlled environment


The Debian Project looks forward to working with its many upstream
projects and the worldwide community of Free Software developers in
preparing the next high-quality Debian release.
