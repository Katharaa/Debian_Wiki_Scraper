Discover Debian's hassle-free trademarks, use them
to promote Debian
====================================================================


**March 1st, 2013**



The Debian Project is pleased to announce that, according to the terms of
the [new trademark policy](https://www.debian.org/trademark#policy), Debian
logos and marks may now be used [freely](https://www.debian.org/intro/free)
for both non-commercial and commercial purposes. The Debian Project
encourages wide use of its marks in all ways that promote
Debian and free software.




Stefano Zacchiroli, current Debian Project Leader and one of the main
promoters of the new trademark policy, said Software freedoms and
trademarks are a difficult match. We all want to see well-known project
names used to promote free software, but we cannot risk they will be
abused to trick users into downloading proprietary spyware. With the help
of [SPI](https://www.spi-inc.org/) and [SFLC](http://www.softwarefreedom.org/), we have
struck a good balance in our new trademark policy. Among other
positive things, it allows all sorts of commercial use; we only
recommend clearly informing customers about how much of the sale price
will be donated to Debian.




As the arrival of the new stable release, Debian 7.0 Wheezy, approaches,
vendors are encouraged to create Wheezy-themed merchandise (t-shirts,
stickers, mugs, etc.), using the
[upcoming
release's artwork](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianArt/Themes/Joy).




We further invite you to check out the current list of
[Debian
merchandise vendors](https://www.debian.org/events/merchandise), and see the information at the bottom of the
page if you would like to be added to it.
