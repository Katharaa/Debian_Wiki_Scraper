Backports integrated in the main archive
========================================


**March 20th, 2013**



The Debian project is pleased to announce that the backports
service for the next stable release Debian 7
(codename Wheezy) will be part of the main archive.
Backports are packages mostly from the testing
distribution (and in few cases from unstable too, e.g.
security updates) recompiled in a stable environment
so that they will run without new libraries (whenever
it is possible) on the Debian stable distribution.
While as for now this service was provided on a separated
archive, starting with wheezy-backports the packages
will be accessible from the regular pool.
  

The users of Wheezy will have to add to their
sources.list file this entry:



```

deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ wheezy-backports main

```

All users of the service are invited to check their regular
mirror if it carries backports and pull from there.
Please note that this change does not affect the current
stable release Debian 6 (codename Squeeze).
