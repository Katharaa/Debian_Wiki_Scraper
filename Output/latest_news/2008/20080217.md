Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 updated
============================


**February 17th, 2008**


The Debian project is pleased to announce the third update of its
stable distribution Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 (codename etch). This update
mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable release,
along with a few adjustment to serious problems.


Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of Debian
GNU/Linux 4.0 but only updates some of the packages included. There is
no need to throw away 4.0 CDs or DVDs but only to update against
ftp.debian.org after an installation, in order to incorporate those late
changes.


Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have
to update many packages and most updates from security.debian.org are
included in this update.


New CD and DVD images containing updated packages and the regular
installation media accompanied with the package archive respectively
will be available soon at the regular locations.


Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
aptitude (or apt) package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to
one of Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors. A comprehensive list of
mirrors is available at:



<https://www.debian.org/mirror/list>

Debian-Installer Update
-----------------------


The installer has been updated to use and support the updated kernels
included in this release. This change causes old netboot and floppy images
to stop working; updated versions are available from the regular locations.


This update also includes stability improvements and added support for
SGI O2 machines with 300MHz RM5200SC (Nevada) CPUs that were announced with
the second update, but were not actually included.


Important changes
-----------------


Updated versions of the bcm43xx-fwcutter package will be distributed via
volatile.debian.org. The package itself will be removed from etch with the
next update.


Flashplugin-nonfree has been removed (see below), as this is closed source
and we don't get security support for it. For security reasons, we
recommend to immediately remove any version of flashplugin-nonfree and any
remaining files of the Adobe Flash Player. Tested updates will be made
available via backports.org.


Miscellaneous Bugfixes

This stable update adds several binary updates for various architectures
to packages whose version was not synchronised across all architectures.
