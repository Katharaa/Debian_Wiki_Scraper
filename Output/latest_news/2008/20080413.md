Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 updated
============================


**April 13th, 2008**


The Debian project is pleased to announce the eighth and final update of its
old stable distribution Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 (codename sarge).
This update mainly adds
corrections for security problems to the oldstable release, along with
a few adjustments to serious problems.


Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of Debian
GNU/Linux 3.1 but only updates some of the packages included. There is
no need to throw away 3.1 CDs or DVDs but only to update against
ftp.debian.org after an installation, in order to incorporate those late
changes.


Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have
to update many packages and all updates from security.debian.org are
included in this update.


New CD and DVD images containing updated packages and the regular
installation media accompanied with the package archive respectively
will be available soon at the regular locations.


Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
aptitude (or apt) package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual
page) to one of Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors. A comprehensive
list of mirrors is available at:



<https://www.debian.org/mirror/list>

Miscellaneous Bugfixes
----------------------


This update adds several binary-only updates for various architectures
to packages whose version was not synchronised across all architectures.
It also adds a few important corrections to the following packages:




| Package | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| [unrar-nonfree](https://packages.debian.org/src:unrar-nonfree) | Fix a buffer overflow (CVE-2007-0855) |
| [wesnoth](https://packages.debian.org/src:wesnoth) | Bring architectures back in sync |
| [pwlib](https://packages.debian.org/src:pwlib) | Bring architectures back in sync |
| [sing](https://packages.debian.org/src:sing) | Fix privilege escalation |
| [alsa-modules-i386](https://packages.debian.org/src:alsa-modules-i386) | Built against the fixed 2.6 ABI, but the old 2.4 ABI |
| [fai-kernels](https://packages.debian.org/src:fai-kernels) | Built against the fixed 2.6 ABI, but the old 2.4 ABI |


Please note that updated packages for alsa-modules-i386 and fai-kernels for
the 2.4 Kernel-Series are available via security.debian.org but could not be
added to this upgrade to prevent the Debian Installer for Sarge breaking as a
result of the ABI change in that kernel update.

rationale is on the preparation page for this revision:

Removed packages
----------------


Flashplugin-nonfree has been removed, as this is closed source
and we don't get security support for it. For security reasons, we
recommend to immediately remove any version of flashplugin-nonfree and any
remaining files of the Adobe Flash Player.


Flyspray has been removed since it has proven to be to buggy and not well
enough supported for a stable release.
