CÃ¡ceres, Extremadura, Spain, 12 December 2008 - The Debian Project,
the team behind the free Debian GNU/Linux operating system,
confirmed the dates and venue for its next annual conference,
DebConf 9.


The conference will take place from 23 to 30 July 2009 at the
Complejo Cultural San Francisco in the UNESCO World Heritage city
CÃ¡ceres, Extremadura, Spain. Venue and accommodation for many
participants will be sponsored by the government of Extremadura.


The government of Extremadura is very supportive of free software,
says CÃ©sar GÃ³mez MartÃ­n, one of the local organisers, and government
member. In addition to our gnuLinEx initiative, a complete computer
software solution for all Extremadura schools and official
institutions built on Debian, we are keen to support free software
projects and events. We are happy to sponsor DebConf, and excited to
bring the conference to the beautiful city of CÃ¡ceres.


On Saturday, 25 July, the conference opens its doors to host talks
and presentations geared at the general public. Developers and users
will be on site to answer questions.


The call for papers and registration will open in January 2009.


DebConf 9 will be preceeded by developer work sessions starting 16
July.
