--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
06 Jun 2020
Affected Packages:

[gnutls28](https://packages.debian.org/src:gnutls28)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 962289](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=962289).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-13777](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13777).  

More information:

A flaw was reported in the TLS session ticket key construction in
GnuTLS, a library implementing the TLS and SSL protocols. The flaw
caused the TLS server to not securely construct a session ticket
encryption key considering the application supplied secret, allowing a
man-in-the-middle attacker to bypass authentication in TLS 1.3 and
recover previous conversations in TLS 1.2.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.7-4+deb10u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages.
