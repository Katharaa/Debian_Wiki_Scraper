More information:

Fabian Vogt discovered a flaw in sddm, a modern display manager for X11.
A local attacker can take advantage of a race condition when creating
the Xauthority file to escalate privileges.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.18.0-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your sddm packages.
