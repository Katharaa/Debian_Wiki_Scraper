More information:

Two security issues were found in libopenmpt, a cross-platform C++ and
C library to decode tracked music files, which could result in denial of
service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code if malformed music
files are processed.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.4.3-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libopenmpt packages.
