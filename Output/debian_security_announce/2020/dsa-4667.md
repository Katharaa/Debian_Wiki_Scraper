Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-2732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-2732), [CVE-2020-8428](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8428), [CVE-2020-10942](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10942), [CVE-2020-11565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11565), [CVE-2020-11884](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11884).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leak.


* [CVE-2020-2732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-2732)
Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
 processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2
 guests when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow
 an L2 guest to cause privilege escalation, denial of service,
 or information leaks in the L1 guest.
* [CVE-2020-8428](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8428)
Al Viro discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the VFS
 layer. This allowed local users to cause a denial-of-service
 (crash) or obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.
* [CVE-2020-10942](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10942)
It was discovered that the vhost\_net driver did not properly
 validate the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user
 permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack
 corruption via crafted system calls, resulting in denial of
 service (crash) or possibly privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2020-11565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11565)
Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did
 not correctly handle an mpol mount option specifying an empty
 node list, leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user
 namespaces are enabled, a local user could use this to cause a
 denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2020-11884](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11884)
Al Viro reported a race condition in memory management code for
 IBM Z (s390x architecture), that can result in the kernel
 executing code from the user address space. A local user could
 use this for privilege escalation.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.19.98-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
