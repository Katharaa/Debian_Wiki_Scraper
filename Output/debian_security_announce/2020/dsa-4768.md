More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser, which could potentially result in the execution of arbitrary
code, cross-site scripting or spoofing the origin of a download.


Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 68.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 78.x releases.


Between 68.x and 78.x, Firefox has seen a number of feature updates.
For more information please refer to
<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/78.0esr/releasenotes/>


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 78.3.0esr-1~deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.
