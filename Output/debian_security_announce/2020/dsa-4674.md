More information:

It was discovered that roundcube, a skinnable AJAX based webmail
solution for IMAP servers, did not correctly process and sanitize
requests. This would allow a remote attacker to perform either a
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) forcing an authenticated user to be
logged out, or a Cross-Side Scripting (XSS) leading to execution of
arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.3+dfsg.1-4+deb9u4.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.11+dfsg.1-1~deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your roundcube packages.
