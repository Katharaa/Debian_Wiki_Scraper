More information:

Miguel Onoro reported that qbittorrent, a bittorrent client with a Qt5
GUI user interface, allows command injection via shell metacharacters in
the torrent name parameter or current tracker parameter, which could
result in remote command execution via a crafted name within an RSS feed
if qbittorrent is configured to run an external program on torrent
completion.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.3.7-3+deb9u1.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.5-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your qbittorrent packages.
