DSA-4819-1 kitty -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
26 Dec 2020
Affected Packages:

[kitty](https://packages.debian.org/src:kitty)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-35605](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-35605).  

More information:

Stephane Chauveau discovered that the graphics protocol implementation in
Kitty, a GPU-based terminal emulator, did not sanitise a filename when
returning an error message, which could result in the execution of
arbitrary shell commands when displaying a file with cat.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.13.3-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your kitty packages.
