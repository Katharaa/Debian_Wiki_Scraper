More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X.Org X server.
Missing input sanitising in X server extensions may result in local
privilege escalation if the X server is configured to run with root
privileges. In addition an ASLR bypass was fixed.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:1.20.4-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your xorg-server packages.
