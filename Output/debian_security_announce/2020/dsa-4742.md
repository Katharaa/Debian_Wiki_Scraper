--------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-17367](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-17367), [CVE-2020-17368](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-17368).  

More information:

Tim Starling discovered two vulnerabilities in firejail, a sandbox
program to restrict the running environment of untrusted applications.


* [CVE-2020-17367](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-17367)
It was reported that firejail does not respect the end-of-options
 separator ("--"), allowing an attacker with control over the command
 line options of the sandboxed application, to write data to a
 specified file.
* [CVE-2020-17368](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-17368)
It was reported that firejail when redirecting output via --output
 or --output-stderr, concatenates all command line arguments into a
 single string that is passed to a shell. An attacker who has control
 over the command line arguments of the sandboxed application could
 take advantage of this flaw to run arbitrary commands.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.58.2-2+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your firejail packages.
