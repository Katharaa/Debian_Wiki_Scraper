Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-9355](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-9355).  

More information:

Kobus van Schoor discovered that network-manager-ssh, a plugin to
provide VPN integration for SSH in NetworkManager, is prone to a
privilege escalation vulnerability. A local user with privileges to
modify a connection can take advantage of this flaw to execute arbitrary
commands as root.


This update drops support to pass extra SSH options to the ssh
invocation.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.2.1-1+deb9u1.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.10-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your network-manager-ssh packages.
