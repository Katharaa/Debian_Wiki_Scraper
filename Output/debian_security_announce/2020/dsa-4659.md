Vulnerable:
Yes

In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-11008](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11008).  

More information:

Carlo Arenas discovered a flaw in git, a fast, scalable, distributed
revision control system. With a crafted URL that contains a newline or
empty host, or lacks a scheme, the credential helper machinery can be
fooled into providing credential information that is not appropriate for
the protocol in use and host being contacted.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:2.11.0-3+deb9u7.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.20.1-2+deb10u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.
