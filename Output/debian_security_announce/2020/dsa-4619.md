DSA-4619-1 libxmlrpc3-java -- security update
---------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
06 Feb 2020
Affected Packages:

[libxmlrpc3-java](https://packages.debian.org/src:libxmlrpc3-java)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 949089](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=949089).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-17570](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17570).  

More information:

Guillaume Teissier reported that the XMLRPC client in libxmlrpc3-java,
an XML-RPC implementation in Java, does perform deserialization of the
server-side exception serialized in the faultCause attribute of XMLRPC
error response messages. A malicious XMLRPC server can take advantage of
this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of an
application using the Apache XMLRPC client library.


Note that a client that expects to get server-side exceptions need to
set explicitly the enabledForExceptions property.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.1.3-8+deb9u1.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.3-9+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libxmlrpc3-java packages.
