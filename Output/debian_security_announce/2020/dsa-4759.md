Affected Packages:

[ark](https://packages.debian.org/src:ark)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 969437](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=969437).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-24654](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-24654).  

More information:

Fabian Vogt reported that the Ark archive manager did not sanitise
extraction paths, which could result in maliciously crafted archives
with symlinks writing outside the extraction directory.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:18.08.3-1+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your ark packages.
