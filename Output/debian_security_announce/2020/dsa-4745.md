More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Dovecot email
server.


* [CVE-2020-12100](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12100)
Receiving mail with deeply nested MIME parts leads to resource
 exhaustion as Dovecot attempts to parse it.
* [CVE-2020-12673](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12673)
Dovecot's NTLM implementation does not correctly check message
 buffer size, which leads to a crash when reading past allocation.
* [CVE-2020-12674](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12674)
Dovecot's RPA mechanism implementation accepts zero-length message,
 which leads to assert-crash later on.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.3.4.1-5+deb10u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your dovecot packages.
