Andrew Bartlett discovered that awl, DAViCal Andrew's Web Libraries,
did not properly handle session management: this would allow a
malicious user to impersonate other sessions or users.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.57-1+deb9u1.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.60-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your awl packages.
