---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
08 Jul 2020
Affected Packages:

[roundcube](https://packages.debian.org/src:roundcube)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 964355](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=964355).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-15562](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-15562).  

More information:

It was discovered that roundcube, a skinnable AJAX based webmail
solution for IMAP servers, did not properly sanitize incoming mail
messages. This would allow a remote attacker to perform a Cross-Side
Scripting (XSS) attack.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.14+dfsg.1-1~deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your roundcube packages.
