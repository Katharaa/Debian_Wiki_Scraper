In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 960271](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=960271).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-3016](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3016), [CVE-2019-19462](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19462), [CVE-2020-0543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-0543), [CVE-2020-10711](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10711), [CVE-2020-10732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10732), [CVE-2020-10751](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10751), [CVE-2020-10757](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10757), [CVE-2020-12114](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12114), [CVE-2020-12464](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12464), [CVE-2020-12768](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12768), [CVE-2020-12770](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12770), [CVE-2020-13143](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13143).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2019-3016](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3016)
It was discovered that the KVM implementation for x86 did not
 always perform TLB flushes when needed, if the paravirtualised
 TLB flush feature was enabled. This could lead to disclosure of
 sensitive information within a guest VM.
* [CVE-2019-19462](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19462)
The syzkaller tool found a missing error check in the relay
 library used to implement various files under debugfs. A local
 user permitted to access debugfs could use this to cause a denial
 of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2020-0543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-0543)
Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
 supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random
 value generated by these instructions may be used in a later
 speculative execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
 Depending on how these instructions are used by applications, a
 local user or VM guest could use this to obtain sensitive
 information such as cryptographic keys from other users or VMs.


This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either
 as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
 package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
 only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
 disable the mitigation if it is not needed.
* [CVE-2020-10711](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10711)
Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues in the
 SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet with null category. A
 remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of
 service (crash). Note that this issue does not affect the binary
 packages distributed in Debian as CONFIG\_NETLABEL is not enabled.
* [CVE-2020-10732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10732)
An information leak of kernel private memory to userspace was found
 in the kernel's implementation of core dumping userspace processes.
* [CVE-2020-10751](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10751)
Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
 handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
 attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.
* [CVE-2020-10757](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10757)
Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX hugepages,
 allowing a local user to escalate their privileges.
* [CVE-2020-12114](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12114)
Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
 pivot\_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user
 with the CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use
 this to cause a denial of service (crash).
* [CVE-2020-12464](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12464)
Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can
 result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be
 exploited, but it could result in a denial of service (crash or
 memory corruption) or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2020-12768](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12768)
A bug was discovered in the KVM implementation for AMD processors,
 which could result in a memory leak. The security impact of this
 is unclear.
* [CVE-2020-12770](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12770)
It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not
 correctly release internal resources in a particular error case.
 A local user permitted to access an sg device could possibly use
 this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion).
* [CVE-2020-13143](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13143)
Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in
 the USB gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to
 the gadget configuration filesystem could use this to cause a
 denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or potentially
 for privilege escalation.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.19.118-2+deb10u1. This version also fixes some related
bugs that do not have their own CVE IDs, and a regression in the
<linux/swab.h> UAPI header introduced in the previous point release
(bug #960271).


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
