More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2019-2182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-2182)
Hanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the arm64
 virtual memory management code, which could lead to an information
 disclosure, denial of service (crash), or possibly privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2019-5108](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-5108)
Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11
 (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger
 roaming for a newly associated station before the station was
 authenticated. An attacker within range of the AP could use this
 to cause a denial of service, either by filling up a switching
 table or by redirecting traffic away from other stations.
* [CVE-2019-19319](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19319)
Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
 implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
 permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
 service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2019-19462](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19462)
The syzbot tool found a missing error check in the relay
 library used to implement various files under debugfs. A local
 user permitted to access debugfs could use this to cause a denial
 of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2019-19768](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19768)
Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
 facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able
 to trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to
 cause a denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2019-20806](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20806)
A potential null pointer dereference was discovered in the tw5864
 media driver. The security impact of this is unclear.
* [CVE-2019-20811](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20811)
The Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an error
 path in the network subsystem. The security impact of this is
 unclear.
* [CVE-2020-0543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-0543)
Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
 supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random
 value generated by these instructions may be used in a later
 speculative execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
 Depending on how these instructions are used by applications, a
 local user or VM guest could use this to obtain sensitive
 information such as cryptographic keys from other users or VMs.


This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either
 as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
 package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update
 only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
 disable the mitigation if it is not needed.
* [CVE-2020-2732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-2732)
Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
 processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2
 guests when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an
 L2 guest to cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or
 information leaks in the L1 guest.
* [CVE-2020-8428](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8428)
Al Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the filesystem
 core (vfs). A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of
 service (crash) or possibly to obtain sensitive information from
 the kernel.
* [CVE-2020-8647](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8647),
[CVE-2020-8649](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8649)
The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in
 the vgacon driver. A local user permitted to access a virtual
 terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver
 could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
 corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2020-8648](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8648)
The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
 driver, which could result in a use-after-free. A local user
 permitted to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a
 denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
 privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2020-9383](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-9383)
Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
 which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access. A local user
 permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a
 denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
 privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2020-10711](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10711)
Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues in the
 SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet with null category. A
 remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of
 service (crash). Note that this issue does not affect the binary
 packages distributed in Debian as CONFIG\_NETLABEL is not enabled.
* [CVE-2020-10732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10732)
An information leak of kernel private memory to userspace was found
 in the kernel's implementation of core dumping userspace processes.
* [CVE-2020-10751](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10751)
Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
 handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
 attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.
* [CVE-2020-10757](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10757)
Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX hugepages,
 allowing a local user to escalate their privileges
* [CVE-2020-10942](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10942)
It was discovered that the vhost\_net driver did not properly
 validate the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user
 permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack
 corruption via crafted system calls, resulting in denial of
 service (crash) or possibly privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2020-11494](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11494)
It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver
 did not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets,
 resulting in an information leak from the kernel to user-space or
 over the CAN network.
* [CVE-2020-11565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11565)
Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did
 not correctly handle an mpol mount option specifying an empty
 node list, leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user
 namespaces are enabled, a local user could use this to cause a
 denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2020-11608](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11608),
[CVE-2020-11609](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11609),
[CVE-2020-11668](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11668)
It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink\_cit media
 drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A
 physically present user with a specially constructed USB device
 could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly
 for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2020-12114](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12114)
Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
 pivot\_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user
 with the CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use
 this to cause a denial of service (crash).
* [CVE-2020-12464](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12464)
Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can
 result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be
 exploited, but it could result in a denial of service (crash or
 memory corruption) or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2020-12652](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12652)
Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers.
 An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice,
 creating a race condition which could result in incorrect locking
 of internal data structures. A local user permitted to access
 /dev/mptctl could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
 memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2020-12653](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12653)
It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
 sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap
 buffer overflow. A local user with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could
 use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
 or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2020-12654](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12654)
It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
 sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an access point
 (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP
 could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
 corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.
* [CVE-2020-12770](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12770)
It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not
 correctly release internal resources in a particular error case.
 A local user permitted to access an sg device could possibly use
 this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion).
* [CVE-2020-13143](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13143)
Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in
 the USB gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to
 the gadget configuration filesystem could use this to cause a
 denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or potentially
 for privilege escalation.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.9.210-1+deb9u1. This version also fixes some
related bugs that do not have their own CVE IDs, and a regression in
the macvlan driver introduced in the previous point release (bug #952660).


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
