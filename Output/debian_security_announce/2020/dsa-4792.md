--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
17 Nov 2020
Affected Packages:

[openldap](https://packages.debian.org/src:openldap)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-25709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25709), [CVE-2020-25710](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25710).  

More information:

Two vulnerabilities in the certificate list syntax verification and
in the handling of CSN normalization were discovered in OpenLDAP, a
free implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.
An unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of these
flaws to cause a denial of service (slapd daemon crash) via
specially crafted packets.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.47+dfsg-3+deb10u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your openldap packages.
