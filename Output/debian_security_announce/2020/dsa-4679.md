Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 959900](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=959900).  

More information:

A vulnerability was found in the EC2 credentials API of Keystone, the
OpenStack identity service: Any user authenticated within a limited
scope (trust/oauth/application credential) could create an EC2 credential
with an escalated permission, such as obtaining admin while
the user is on a limited viewer role.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:14.2.0-0+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your keystone packages.
