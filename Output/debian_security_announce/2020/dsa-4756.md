DSA-4756-1 lilypond -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
29 Aug 2020
Affected Packages:

[lilypond](https://packages.debian.org/src:lilypond)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-17353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-17353).  

More information:

Faidon Liambotis discovered that Lilypond, a program for typesetting
sheet music, did not restrict the inclusion of Postscript and SVG
commands when operating in safe mode, which could result in the
execution of arbitrary code when rendering a typesheet file with
embedded Postscript code.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.19.81+really-2.18.2-13+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your lilypond packages.
