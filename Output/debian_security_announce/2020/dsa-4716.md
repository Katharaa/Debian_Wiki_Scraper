Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-4716-1 docker.io -- security update
---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
02 Jul 2020
Affected Packages:

[docker.io](https://packages.debian.org/src:docker.io)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 962141](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=962141).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-13401](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13401).  

More information:

Etienne Champetier discovered that Docker, a Linux container runtime,
created network bridges which by default accept IPv6 router advertisements.
This could allow an attacker with the CAP\_NET\_RAW capability in a
container to spoof router advertisements, resulting in information
disclosure or denial of service.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 18.09.1+dfsg1-7.1+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your docker.io packages.
