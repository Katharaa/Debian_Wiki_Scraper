Vulnerable:

Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-10072](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10072), [CVE-2019-12418](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12418), [CVE-2019-17563](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17563), [CVE-2019-17569](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17569), [CVE-2020-1935](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1935), [CVE-2020-1938](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1938).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Tomcat servlet and JSP
engine, which could result in HTTP request smuggling, code execution
in the AJP connector (disabled by default in Debian) or a man-in-the-middle
attack against the JMX interface.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.0.31-1~deb10u1. The fix for [CVE-2020-1938](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1938) may require
configuration changes when Tomcat is used with the AJP connector, e.g.
in combination with libapache-mod-jk. For instance the attribute
secretRequired is set to true by default now. For affected setups it's
recommended to review <https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/config/ajp.html>
before the deploying the update.


We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat9 packages.
