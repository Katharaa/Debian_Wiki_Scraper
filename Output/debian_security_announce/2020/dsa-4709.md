More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They allowed remote attackers to perform various Cross-Side
Scripting (XSS) attacks, create open redirects, escalate privileges,
and bypass authorization access.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.10+dfsg1-0+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.
