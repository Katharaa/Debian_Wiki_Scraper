Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 950121](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=950121).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-7247](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-7247).  

More information:

Qualys discovered that the OpenSMTPD SMTP server performed insufficient
validation of email addresses which could result in the execution of
arbitrary commands as root. In addition this update fixes a denial of
service by triggering an opportunistic TLS downgrade.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 6.0.2p1-2+deb9u2.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.0.3p1-5+deb10u3. This update also includes non-security
bugfixes which were already lined up for the Buster 10.3 point release.


We recommend that you upgrade your opensmtpd packages.
