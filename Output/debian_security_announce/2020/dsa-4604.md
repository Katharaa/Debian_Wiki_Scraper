Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 947374](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=947374), [Bug 947375](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=947375), [Bug 941036](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=941036).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-16723](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16723), [CVE-2019-17357](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17357), [CVE-2019-17358](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17358).  

More information:

Multiple issues have been found in cacti, a server monitoring system,
potentially resulting in SQL code execution or information disclosure by
authenticated users.


* [CVE-2019-16723](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16723)
Authenticated users may bypass authorization checks for viewing a graph
 by submitting requests with modified local\_graph\_id parameters.
* [CVE-2019-17357](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17357)
The graph administration interface insufficiently sanitizes the
 template\_id parameter, potentially resulting in SQL injection. This
 vulnerability might be leveraged by authenticated attackers to perform
 unauthorized SQL code execution on the database.
* [CVE-2019-17358](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17358)
The sanitize\_unserialize\_selected\_items function (lib/functions.php)
 insufficiently sanitizes user input before deserializing it,
 potentially resulting in unsafe deserialization of user-controlled
 data. This vulnerability might be leveraged by authenticated attackers
 to influence the program control flow or cause memory corruption.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.8.8h+ds1-10+deb9u1. Note that stretch was only affected by
[CVE-2018-17358](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-17358).


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.2+ds1-2+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your cacti packages.
