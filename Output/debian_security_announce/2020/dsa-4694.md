DSA-4694-1 unbound -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
26 May 2020
Affected Packages:

[unbound](https://packages.debian.org/src:unbound)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-12662](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12662), [CVE-2020-12663](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12663).  

More information:

Two vulnerabiliites have been discovered in Unbound, a recursive-only
caching DNS server; a traffic amplification attack against third party
authoritative name servers (NXNSAttack) and insufficient sanitisation
of replies from upstream servers could result in denial of service via
an infinite loop.


The version of Unbound in the oldstable distribution (stretch) is
no longer supported. If these security issues affect your setup, you
should upgrade to the stable distribution (buster).


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0-2+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your unbound packages.
