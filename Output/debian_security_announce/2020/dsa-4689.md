Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 945171](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=945171).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-6477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-6477), [CVE-2020-8616](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8616), [CVE-2020-8617](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8617).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server
implementation.


* [CVE-2019-6477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-6477)
It was discovered that TCP-pipelined queries can bypass tcp-client
 limits resulting in denial of service.
* [CVE-2020-8616](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8616)
It was discovered that BIND does not sufficiently limit the number
 of fetches performed when processing referrals. An attacker can take
 advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service (performance
 degradation) or use the recursing server in a reflection attack with
 a high amplification factor.
* [CVE-2020-8617](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8617)
It was discovered that a logic error in the code which checks TSIG
 validity can be used to trigger an assertion failure, resulting in
 denial of service.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-12.3+deb9u6.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
