Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 908712](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=908712).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-12351](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12351), [CVE-2020-12352](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12352), [CVE-2020-25211](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25211), [CVE-2020-25643](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25643), [CVE-2020-25645](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25645).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service or information leaks.


* [CVE-2020-12351](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12351)
Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation in the
 way L2CAP packets with A2MP CID are handled. A remote attacker in
 short distance knowing the victim's Bluetooth device address can
 send a malicious l2cap packet and cause a denial of service or
 possibly arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.
* [CVE-2020-12352](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12352)
Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation. Stack
 memory is not properly initialised when handling certain AMP
 packets. A remote attacker in short distance knowing the victim's
 Bluetooth device address can retrieve kernel stack information.
* [CVE-2020-25211](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25211)
A flaw was discovered in netfilter subsystem. A local attacker
 able to inject conntrack Netlink configuration can cause a denial
 of service.
* [CVE-2020-25643](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25643)
ChenNan Of Chaitin Security Research Lab discovered a flaw in the
 hdlc\_ppp module. Improper input validation in the ppp\_cp\_parse\_cr()
 function may lead to memory corruption and information disclosure.
* [CVE-2020-25645](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25645)
A flaw was discovered in the interface driver for GENEVE
 encapsulated traffic when combined with IPsec. If IPsec is
 configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the
 GENEVE tunnel, tunneled data isn't correctly routed over the
 encrypted link and sent unencrypted instead.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.19.152-1. The vulnerabilities are fixed by rebasing to the new
stable upstream version 4.19.152 which includes additional bugfixes.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
