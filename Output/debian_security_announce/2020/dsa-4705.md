More information:

It was discovered that Django, a high-level Python web development
framework, did not properly sanitize input. This would allow a remote
attacker to perform SQL injection attacks, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
attacks, or leak sensitive information.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:1.10.7-2+deb9u9.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.11.29-1~deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
