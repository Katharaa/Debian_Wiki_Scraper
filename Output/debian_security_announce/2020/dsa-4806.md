More information:

It was discovered that missing input validation in minidlna, a
lightweight DLNA/UPnP-AV server could result in the execution of
arbitrary code. In addition minidlna was susceptible to the
CallStranger UPnP vulnerability.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
