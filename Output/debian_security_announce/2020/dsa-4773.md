More information:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in yaws, a high performance HTTP 1.1
webserver written in Erlang.


* [CVE-2020-24379](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-24379)
The WebDAV implementation is prone to a XML External Entity (XXE)
 injection vulnerability.
* [CVE-2020-24916](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-24916)
The CGI implementation does not properly sanitize CGI requests
 allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands via
 specially crafted CGI executable names.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.6+dfsg-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your yaws packages.
