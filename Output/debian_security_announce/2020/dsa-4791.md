DSA-4791-1 pacemaker -- security update
---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
13 Nov 2020
Affected Packages:

[pacemaker](https://packages.debian.org/src:pacemaker)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 973254](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=973254).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-25654](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25654).  

More information:

Ken Gaillot discovered a vulnerability in the Pacemaker cluster
resource manager: If ACLs were configured for users in the haclient
group, the ACL restrictions could be bypassed via unrestricted IPC
communication, resulting in cluster-wide arbitrary code execution with
root privileges.


If the enable-acl cluster option isn't enabled, members of the
haclient group can modify Pacemaker's Cluster Information Base without
restriction, which already gives them these capabilities, so there is
no additional exposure in such a setup.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.1-5+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your pacemaker packages.
