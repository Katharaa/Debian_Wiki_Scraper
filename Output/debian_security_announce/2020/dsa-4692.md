More information:

Georgi Guninski and the Qualys Research Labs discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in qmail (shipped in Debian as netqmail with additional
patches) which could result in the execution of arbitrary code, bypass
of mail address verification and a local information leak whether a file
exists or not.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.06-6.2~deb9u1.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.06-6.2~deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your netqmail packages.
