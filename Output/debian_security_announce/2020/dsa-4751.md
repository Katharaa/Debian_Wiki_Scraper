More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Squid, a fully featured web
proxy cache, which could result in request splitting, request smuggling
(leading to cache poisoning) and denial of service when processing
crafted cache digest responses messages.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.6-1+deb10u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your squid packages.
