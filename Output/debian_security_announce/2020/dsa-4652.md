More information:

A flaw was reported in the DTLS protocol implementation in GnuTLS, a
library implementing the TLS and SSL protocols. The DTLS client would
not contribute any randomness to the DTLS negotiation, breaking the
security guarantees of the DTLS protocol.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.7-4+deb10u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages.
