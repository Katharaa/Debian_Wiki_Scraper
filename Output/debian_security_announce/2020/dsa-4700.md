More information:

Matei Badanoiu and LoRexxar@knownsec discovered that roundcube, a
skinnable AJAX based webmail solution for IMAP servers, did not
correctly process and sanitize requests. This would allow a remote
attacker to perform a Cross-Side Scripting (XSS) attack leading to the
execution of arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.3+dfsg.1-4+deb9u5.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.13+dfsg.1-1~deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your roundcube packages.
