DSA-4649-1 haproxy -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
02 Apr 2020
Affected Packages:

[haproxy](https://packages.debian.org/src:haproxy)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-11100](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11100).  

More information:

Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero discovered that HAProxy, a TCP/HTTP
reverse proxy, did not properly handle HTTP/2 headers. This would allow
an attacker to write arbitrary bytes around a certain location on the
heap, resulting in denial-of-service or potential arbitrary code
execution.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.19-1+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.
