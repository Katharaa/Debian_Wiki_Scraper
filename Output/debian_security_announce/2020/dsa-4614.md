----------------------------------



Date Reported:
01 Feb 2020
Affected Packages:

[sudo](https://packages.debian.org/src:sudo)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 950371](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=950371).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-18634](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18634).  

More information:

Joe Vennix discovered a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in
sudo, a program designed to provide limited super user privileges to
specific users, triggerable when configured with the pwfeedback option
enabled. An unprivileged user can take advantage of this flaw to obtain
full root privileges.


Details can be found in the upstream advisory at
<https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/pwfeedback.html> .


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.8.19p1-2.1+deb9u2.


For the stable distribution (buster), exploitation of the bug is
prevented due to a change in EOF handling introduced in 1.8.26.


We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.
