More information:

Multiple security issues were discovered in the microdns plugin of the
VLC media player, which could result in denial of service or potentially
the execution of arbitrary code via malicious mDNS packets.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.0.10-0+deb9u1. This update disables the microdns plugin.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.10-0+deb10u1. This update disables the microdns plugin.


We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.
