-------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Aug 2020
Affected Packages:

[ruby-kramdown](https://packages.debian.org/src:ruby-kramdown)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 965305](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=965305).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-14001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-14001).  

More information:

A flaw was discovered in ruby-kramdown, a fast, pure ruby, Markdown
parser and converter, which could result in unintended read access to
files or unintended embedded Ruby code execution when the {::options /}
extension is used together with the template option.


The update introduces a new option forbidden\_inline\_options to
restrict the options allowed with the {::options /} extension. By
default the template option is forbidden.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.17.0-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-kramdown packages.
