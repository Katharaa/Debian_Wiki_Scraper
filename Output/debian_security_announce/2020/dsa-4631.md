Multiple security issues were discovered in Pillow, a Python imaging
library, which could result in denial of service and potentially the
execution of arbitrary code if malformed PCX, FLI, SGI or TIFF images
are processed.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.0-4+deb9u1.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.1-2+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your pillow packages.
