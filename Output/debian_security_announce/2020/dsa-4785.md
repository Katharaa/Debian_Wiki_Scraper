In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 973889](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=973889).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-18926](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18926).  

More information:

It was discovered that raptor2, an RDF parser library, is prone to
heap-based buffer overflow flaws, which could result in denial of
service, or potentially the execution of arbitrary code, if a specially
crafted file is processed.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14-1.1~deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your raptor2 packages.
