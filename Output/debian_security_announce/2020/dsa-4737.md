----------------------------------



Date Reported:
29 Jul 2020
Affected Packages:

[xrdp](https://packages.debian.org/src:xrdp)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 964573](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=964573).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-4044](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-4044).  

More information:

Ashley Newson discovered that the XRDP sessions manager was susceptible
to denial of service. A local attacker can further take advantage of
this flaw to impersonate the XRDP sessions manager and capture any user
credentials that are submitted to XRDP, approve or reject arbitrary
login credentials or to hijack existing sessions for xorgxrdp sessions.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.9-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your xrdp packages.
