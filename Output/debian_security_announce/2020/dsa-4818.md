More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Sympa, a mailing list
manager, which could result in local privilege escalation, denial of
service or unauthorized access via the SOAP API.


Additionally to mitigate [CVE-2020-26880](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-26880) the sympa\_newaliases-wrapper is no longer installed
setuid root by default. A new Debconf question is introduced to allow
setuid installations in setups where it is needed.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.2.40~dfsg-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your sympa packages.
