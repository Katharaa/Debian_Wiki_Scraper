DSA-4814-1 xerces-c -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
17 Dec 2020
Affected Packages:

[xerces-c](https://packages.debian.org/src:xerces-c)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 947431](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=947431).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-1311](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1311).  

More information:

It was discovered that xerces-c, a validating XML parser library for
C++, did not correctly scan DTDs. The use-after-free vulnerability
resulting from this issue would allow a remote attacker to leverage a
specially crafted XML file in order to crash the application or
potentially execute arbitrary code.
Please note that the patch fixing this issue comes at the expense of a
newly introduced memory leak.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.2+debian-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your xerces-c packages.
