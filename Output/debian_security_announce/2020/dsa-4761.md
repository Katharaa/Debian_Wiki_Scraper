DSA-4761-1 zeromq3 -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Sep 2020
Affected Packages:

[zeromq3](https://packages.debian.org/src:zeromq3)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-15166](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-15166).  

More information:

It was discovered that ZeroMQ, a lightweight messaging kernel library
does not properly handle connecting peers before a handshake is
completed. A remote, unauthenticated client connecting to an application
using the libzmq library, running with a socket listening with CURVE
encryption/authentication enabled can take advantage of this flaw to
cause a denial of service affecting authenticated and encrypted clients.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.3.1-4+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your zeromq3 packages.
