More information:

Multiple security issues were found in PHP, a widely-used open source
general purpose scripting language which could result in information
disclosure, denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary
code.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.0.33-0+deb9u8.


We recommend that you upgrade your php7.0 packages.
