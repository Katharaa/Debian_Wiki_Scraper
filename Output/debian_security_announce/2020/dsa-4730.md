Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 963808](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=963808).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-4054](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-4054).  

More information:

Michal Bentkowski discovered that ruby-sanitize, a whitelist-based HTML
sanitizer, is prone to a HTML sanitization bypass vulnerability when
using the relaxed or a custom config allowing certain elements.
Content in a <math> or <svg> element may not be sanitized correctly even
if math and svg are not in the allowlist.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.6.6-2.1~deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-sanitize packages.
