Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2607-1 qemu-kvm -- buffer overflow
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
15 Jan 2013
Affected Packages:

[qemu-kvm](https://packages.debian.org/src:qemu-kvm)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 696051](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=696051).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-6075](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6075).  

More information:

It was discovered that the e1000 emulation code in QEMU does not
enforce frame size limits in the same way as the real hardware does.
This could trigger buffer overflows in the guest operating system
driver for that network card, assuming that the host system does not
discard such frames (which it will by default).


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5+dfsg-5+squeeze10.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
