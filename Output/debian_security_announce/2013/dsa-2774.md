DSA-2774-1 gnupg2 -- several vulnerabilities
--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Oct 2013
Affected Packages:

[gnupg2](https://packages.debian.org/src:gnupg2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 722724](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=722724), [Bug 725433](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=725433).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-4351](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4351), [CVE-2013-4402](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4402).  

More information:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in GnuPG 2, the GNU privacy guard,
a free PGP replacement. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2013-4351](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4351)
When a key or subkey had its key flags subpacket set to all bits
 off, GnuPG currently would treat the key as having all bits set.
 That is, where the owner wanted to indicate no use permitted,
 GnuPG would interpret it as all use permitted. Such no use
 permitted keys are rare and only used in very special circumstances.
* [CVE-2013-4402](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4402)
Infinite recursion in the compressed packet parser was possible
 with crafted input data, which may be used to cause a denial of
 service.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.14-2+squeeze2.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.19-2+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.22-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg2 packages.
