----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
26 Feb 2013
Affected Packages:

[fusionforge](https://packages.debian.org/src:fusionforge)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-1423](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1423).  

More information:

Helmut Grohne discovered multiple privilege escalation flaws in FusionForge, a
web-based project-management and collaboration software. Most of the
vulnerabilities are related to the bad handling of privileged operations on
user-controlled files or directories.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.2-5+squeeze2.


For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distribution, these problems will
be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your fusionforge packages.
