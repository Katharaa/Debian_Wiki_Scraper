More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in FFmpeg, a multimedia
player, server and encoder. Multiple input validations in the
decoders/demuxers for Shorten, Chinese AVS video, VP5, VP6, AVI, AVS and
MPEG-1/2 files could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.


Most of these issues were discovered by Mateusz Jurczyk and Gynvael
Coldwind.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:0.5.10-1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 6:0.8.5-1 of the source package
libav.


We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.
