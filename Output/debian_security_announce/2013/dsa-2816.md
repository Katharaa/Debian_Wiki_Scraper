Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language commonly used for web application development. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2013-6420](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6420)
Stefan Esser reported possible memory corruption in
 openssl\_x509\_parse().
* [CVE-2013-6712](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6712)
Creating DateInterval objects from parsed ISO dates was
 not properly restricted, which allowed to cause a
 denial of service.


In addition, the update for Debian 7 Wheezy contains several bugfixes
originally targeted for the upcoming Wheezy point release.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze18.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14+deb7u7.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.6+dfsg-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
