More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: multiple memory safety errors,
missing permission checks and other implementation errors may lead to
the execution of arbitrary code, cross-site scripting, privilege
escalation, bypass of the same-origin policy or the installation of
malicious addons.


The Iceweasel version in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is no
longer supported with security updates.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.8esr-1~deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.8esr-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
