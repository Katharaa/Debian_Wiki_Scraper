Cyril Arnaud and Pierre-Alain Fouque discovered timing attacks against
 the RSA implementation.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed in
version 1.2.9-1~deb6u1 soon (due to a technical limitation the updates
cannot be released synchronously).


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.9-1~deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.
