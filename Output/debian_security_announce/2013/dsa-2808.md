More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJPEG, a JPEG 2000
image library, that may lead to denial of service ([CVE-2013-1447](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1447)) via
application crash or high memory consumption, possible code execution
through heap buffer overflows ([CVE-2013-6045](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6045)), information disclosure
([CVE-2013-6052](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6052)), or yet another heap buffer overflow that only appears
to affect OpenJPEG 1.3 ([CVE-2013-6054](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6054)).


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3+dfsg-4+squeeze2.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3+dfsg-4.7.


For the testing distribution (jessie), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your openjpeg packages.
