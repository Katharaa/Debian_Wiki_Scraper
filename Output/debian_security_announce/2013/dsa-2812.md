More information:

Two security issues were found in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file, print, and
login server:


* [CVE-2013-4408](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4408)
It was discovered that multiple buffer overflows in the processing
 of DCE-RPC packets may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2013-4475](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4475)
Hemanth Thummala discovered that ACLs were not checked when opening
 files with alternate data streams. This issue is only exploitable
 if the VFS modules vfs\_streams\_depot and/or vfs\_streams\_xattr are
 used.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.6~dfsg-3squeeze11.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.6-6+deb7u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
