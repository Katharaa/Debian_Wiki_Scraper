Jibbers McGee discovered that PyMongo, a high-performance schema-free
document-oriented data store, is prone to a denial-of-service
vulnerability.


An attacker can remotely trigger a NULL pointer dereference causing MongoDB
to crash.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2-4+deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your pymongo packages.
