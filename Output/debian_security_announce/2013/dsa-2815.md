-------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[munin](https://packages.debian.org/src:munin)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-6048](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6048), [CVE-2013-6359](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6359).  

More information:

Christoph Biedl discovered two denial of service vulnerabilities in
munin, a network-wide graphing framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2013-6048](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6048)
The Munin::Master::Node module of munin does not properly validate
 certain data a node sends. A malicious node might exploit this to
 drive the munin-html process into an infinite loop with memory
 exhaustion on the munin master.
* [CVE-2013-6359](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6359)
A malicious node, with a plugin enabled using multigraph as a
 multigraph service name, can abort data collection for the entire
 node the plugin runs on.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.6-4+deb7u2.


For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.18-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.18-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your munin packages.
