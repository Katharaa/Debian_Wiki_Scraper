DSA-2626-1 lighttpd -- several issues
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
17 Feb 2013
Affected Packages:

[lighttpd](https://packages.debian.org/src:lighttpd)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 700399](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=700399).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2009-3555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555), [CVE-2012-4929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4929).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the TLS/SSL protocol. This
update addresses these protocol vulnerabilities in lighttpd.


* [CVE-2009-3555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555)
Marsh Ray, Steve Dispensa, and Martin Rex discovered that the TLS
 and SSLv3 protocols do not properly associate renegotiation
 handshakes with an existing connection, which allows man-in-the-middle
 attackers to insert data into HTTPS sessions. This issue is solved
 in lighttpd by disabling client initiated renegotiation by default.




 Those users that do actually need such renegotiations, can reenable
 them via the new ssl.disable-client-renegotiation parameter.
* [CVE-2012-4929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4929)
Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong discovered a weakness in the TLS/SSL
 protocol when using compression. This side channel attack, dubbed
 CRIME, allows eavesdroppers to gather information to recover the
 original plaintext in the protocol. This update disables compression.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.28-2+squeeze1.2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid)
these problems have been fixed in version 1.4.30-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.
