More information:

A buffer overflow has been identified in nginx, a small, powerful,
scalable web/proxy server, when processing certain chunked transfer
encoding requests if proxy\_pass to untrusted upstream HTTP servers is
used. An attacker may use this flaw to perform denial of service
attacks, disclose worker process memory, or possibly execute arbitrary
code.


The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-2.2+wheezy1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.
