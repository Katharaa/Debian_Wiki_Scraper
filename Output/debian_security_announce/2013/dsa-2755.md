DSA-2755-1 python-django -- directory traversal
-----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
11 Sep 2013
Affected Packages:

[python-django](https://packages.debian.org/src:python-django)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-4315](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4315).  

More information:

Rainer Koirikivi discovered a directory traversal vulnerability with
ssi template tags in python-django, a high-level Python web
development framework.


It was shown that the handling of the ALLOWED\_INCLUDE\_ROOTS setting,
used to represent allowed prefixes for the {% ssi %} template tag, is
vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, by specifying a file path
which begins as the absolute path of a directory in
ALLOWED\_INCLUDE\_ROOTS, and then uses relative paths to break free.


To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must be in a position to alter
templates on the site, or the site to be attacked must have one or more
templates making use of the ssi tag, and must allow some form of
unsanitized user input to be used as an argument to the ssi tag.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze7.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
