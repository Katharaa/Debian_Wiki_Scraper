More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service, information leak or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2013-0160](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0160)
vladz reported a timing leak with the /dev/ptmx character device. A local
 user could use this to determine sensitive information such as password
 length.
* [CVE-2013-1796](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1796)
Andrew Honig of Google reported an issue in the KVM subsystem. A user in
 a guest operating system could corrupt kernel memory, resulting in a
 denial of service.
* [CVE-2013-1929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1929)
Oded Horovitz and Brad Spengler reported an issue in the device driver for
 Broadcom Tigon3 based gigabit Ethernet. Users with the ability to attach
 untrusted devices can create an overflow condition, resulting in a denial
 of service or elevated privileges.
* [CVE-2013-1979](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1979)
Andy Lutomirski reported an issue in the socket level control message
 processing subsystem. Local users may be able to gain eleveated privileges.
* [CVE-2013-2015](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2015)
Theodore Ts'o provided a fix for an issue in the ext4 filesystem. Local
 users with the ability to mount a specially crafted filesystem can cause
 a denial of service (infinite loop).
* [CVE-2013-2094](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2094)
Tommie Rantala discovered an issue in the perf subsystem. An out-of-bounds
 access vulnerability allows local users to gain elevated privileges.
* [CVE-2013-3076](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3076)
Mathias Krause discovered an issue in the userspace interface for hash
 algorithms. Local users can gain access to sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2013-3222](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3222)
Mathias Krause discovered an issue in the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
 protocol support. Local users can gain access to sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2013-3223](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3223)
Mathias Krause discovered an issue in the Amateur Radio AX.25 protocol
 support. Local users can gain access to sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2013-3224](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3224)
Mathias Krause discovered an issue in the Bluetooth subsystem. Local users
 can gain access to sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2013-3225](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3225)
Mathias Krause discovered an issue in the Bluetooth RFCOMM protocol
 support. Local users can gain access to sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2013-3227](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3227)
Mathias Krause discovered an issue in the Communication CPU to Application
 CPU Interface (CAIF). Local users can gain access to sensitive kernel
 memory.
* [CVE-2013-3228](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3228)
Mathias Krause discovered an issue in the IrDA (infrared) subsystem
 support. Local users can gain access to sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2013-3229](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3229)
Mathias Krause discovered an issue in the IUCV support on s390 systems.
 Local users can gain access to sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2013-3231](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3231)
Mathias Krause discovered an issue in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2
 protocol support. Local users can gain access to sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2013-3234](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3234)
Mathias Krause discovered an issue in the Amateur Radio X.25 PLP (Rose)
 protocol support. Local users can gain access to sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2013-3235](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3235)
Mathias Krause discovered an issue in the Transparent Inter Process
 Communication (TIPC) protocol support. Local users can gain access to
 sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2013-3301](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3301)
Namhyung Kim reported an issue in the tracing subsystem. A privileged
 local user could cause a denial of service (system crash). This
 vulnerabililty is not applicable to Debian systems by default.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in version
3.2.41-2+deb7u1.
**Note**: Updates are currently available for the amd64, i386, ia64, s390, s390x
and sparc architectures. Updates for the remaining architectures will be
released as they become available.


The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:





|  | Debian 7.0 (wheezy) |
| --- | --- |
| user-mode-linux | 3.2-2um-1+deb7u1 |



We recommend that you upgrade your linux and user-mode-linux packages.
**Note**: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.
