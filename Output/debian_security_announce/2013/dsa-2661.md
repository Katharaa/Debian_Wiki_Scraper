DSA-2661-1 xorg-server -- information disclosure
------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
17 Apr 2013
Affected Packages:

[xorg-server](https://packages.debian.org/src:xorg-server)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-1940](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1940).  

More information:

David Airlie and Peter Hutterer of Red Hat discovered that xorg-server,
the X.Org X server was vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw
related to input handling and devices hotplug.


When an X server is running but not on front (for example because of a VT
switch), a newly plugged input device would still be recognized and
handled by the X server, which would actually transmit input events to
its clients on the background.


This could allow an attacker to recover some input events not intended
for the X clients, including sensitive information.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.7.7-16.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.12.4-6.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.12.4-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your xorg-server packages.
