More information:

John Fitzpatrick of MWR InfoSecurity discovered an authentication bypass
vulnerability in torque, a PBS-derived batch processing queueing system.


The torque authentication model revolves around the use of privileged
ports. If a request is not made from a privileged port then it is
assumed not to be trusted or authenticated. It was found that pbs\_mom
does not perform a check to ensure that connections are established
from a privileged port.


A user who can run jobs or login to a node running pbs\_server or pbs\_mom
can exploit this vulnerability to remotely execute code as root on the
cluster by submitting a command directly to a pbs\_mom daemon
to queue and run a job.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.8+dfsg-9squeeze2.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.16+dfsg-1+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your torque packages.
