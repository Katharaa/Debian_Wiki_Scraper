Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2798-1 curl -- unchecked ssl certificate host name
------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
17 Nov 2013
Affected Packages:

[curl](https://packages.debian.org/src:curl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-4545](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4545).  

More information:

Scott Cantor discovered that curl, a file retrieval tool, would disable
the CURLOPT\_SSLVERIFYHOST check when the CURLOPT\_SSL\_VERIFYPEER setting
was disabled. This would also disable ssl certificate host name checks
when it should have only disabled verification of the certificate trust
chain.


The default configuration for the curl package is not affected by this
issue since CURLOPT\_SSLVERIFYPEER is enabled by default.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze5.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy5.


For the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
has been fixed in version 7.33.0-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
