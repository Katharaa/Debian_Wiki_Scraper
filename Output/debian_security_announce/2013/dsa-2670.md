More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Request Tracker, an
extensible trouble-ticket tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2013-3368](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3368)
The rt command line tool uses semi-predictable temporary files. A
 malicious user can use this flaw to overwrite files with permissions
 of the user running the rt command line tool.
* [CVE-2013-3369](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3369)
A malicious user who is allowed to see administration pages can run
 arbitrary Mason components (without control of arguments), which may
 have negative side-effects.
* [CVE-2013-3370](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3370)
Request Tracker allows direct requests to private callback
 components, which could be used to exploit a Request Tracker
 extension or a local callback which uses the arguments passed to it
 insecurely.
* [CVE-2013-3371](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3371)
Request Tracker is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks via
 attachment filenames.
* [CVE-2013-3372](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3372)
Dominic Hargreaves discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to
 an HTTP header injection limited to the value of the
 Content-Disposition header.
* [CVE-2013-3373](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3373)
Request Tracker is vulnerable to a MIME header injection in outgoing
 email generated by Request Tracker.


Request Tracker stock templates are resolved by this update. But any
 custom email templates should be updated to ensure that values
 interpolated into mail headers do not contain newlines.
* [CVE-2013-3374](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3374)
Request Tracker is vulnerable to limited session re-use when using
 the file-based session store, Apache::Session::File. However Request
 Tracker's default session configuration only uses
 Apache::Session::File when configured for Oracle databases.


This version of Request Tracker includes a database content upgrade. If
you are using a dbconfig-managed database, you will be offered the
choice of applying this automatically. Otherwise see the explanation in
/usr/share/doc/request-tracker3.8/NEWS.Debian.gz for the manual steps to
perform.


Please note that if you run request-tracker3.8 under the Apache web
server, you must stop and start Apache manually. The restart mechanism
is not recommended, especially when using mod\_perl or any form of
persistent Perl process such as FastCGI or SpeedyCGI.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.8.8-7+squeeze7.


The stable, testing and unstable distributions do not contain anymore
request-tracker3.8, which is replaced by request-tracker4.


We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker3.8 packages.
