More information:

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows were discovered in libupnp, a library
used for handling the Universal Plug and Play protocol. HD Moore from Rapid7
discovered that SSDP queries where not correctly handled by the
unique\_service\_name() function.


An attacker sending carefully crafted SSDP queries to a daemon built on libupnp
could generate a buffer overflow, overwriting the stack, leading to the daemon
crash and possible remote code execution.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.6-5+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.17-1.2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.17-1.2.


We recommend that you upgrade your libupnp packages.
