More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Ruby language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2013-1821](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1821)
Ben Murphy discovered that unrestricted entity expansion in REXML
 can lead to a Denial of Service by consuming all host memory.
* [CVE-2013-4073](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4073)
William (B.J.) Snow Orvis discovered a vulnerability in the hostname
 checking in Ruby's SSL client that could allow man-in-the-middle
 attackers to spoof SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a
 trusted certification authority.
* [CVE-2013-4164](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4164)
Charlie Somerville discovered that Ruby incorrectly handled floating
 point number conversion. If an application using Ruby accepted
 untrusted input strings and converted them to floating point
 numbers, an attacker able to provide such input could cause the
 application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
 privileges of the application.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.7.302-2squeeze2.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.7.358-7.1+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.7.358-9.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.8 packages.
