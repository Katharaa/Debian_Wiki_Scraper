Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2609-1 rails -- SQL query manipulation
------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
16 Jan 2013
Affected Packages:

[rails](https://packages.debian.org/src:rails)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-0155](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0155).  

More information:

An interpretation conflict can cause the Active Record component of
Rails, a web framework for the Ruby programming language, to truncate
queries in unexpected ways. This may allow attackers to elevate their
privileges.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze5.


We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.
