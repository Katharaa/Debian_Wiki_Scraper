========================


DSA-2810-1 ruby1.9.1 -- heap overflow
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
04 Dec 2013
Affected Packages:

[ruby1.9.1](https://packages.debian.org/src:ruby1.9.1)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 730178](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=730178).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-4164](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4164).  

More information:

Charlie Somerville discovered that Ruby incorrectly handled floating
point number conversion. If an application using Ruby accepted untrusted
input strings and converted them to floating point numbers, an attacker
able to provide such input could cause the application to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.2.0-2+deb6u2.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.3.194-8.1+deb7u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.3.484-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.9.1 packages.
