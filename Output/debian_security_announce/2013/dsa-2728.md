Maxim Shudrak and the HP Zero Day Initiative reported a denial of
service vulnerability in BIND, a DNS server. A specially crafted query
that includes malformed rdata can cause named daemon to terminate with
an assertion failure while rejecting the malformed query.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze11.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
