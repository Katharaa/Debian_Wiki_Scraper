========================


DSA-2742-1 php5 -- interpretation conflict
------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
26 Aug 2013
Affected Packages:

[php5](https://packages.debian.org/src:php5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 719765](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=719765).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-4248](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4248).  

More information:

It was discovered that PHP, a general-purpose scripting language
commonly used for web application development, did not properly
process embedded NUL characters in the subjectAltName extension of
X.509 certificates. Depending on the application and with
insufficient CA-level checks, this could be abused for impersonating
other users.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze17.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14+deb7u4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.5.3+dfsg-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
