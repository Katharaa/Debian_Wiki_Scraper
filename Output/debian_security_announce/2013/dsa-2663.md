DSA-2663-1 tinc -- stack based buffer overflow
----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
22 Apr 2013
Affected Packages:

[tinc](https://packages.debian.org/src:tinc)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-1428](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1428).  

More information:

Martin Schobert discovered a stack-based vulnerability in tinc, a
Virtual Private Network (VPN) daemon.


When packets are forwarded via TCP, packet length is not checked against
the stack buffer length. Authenticated peers could use this to crash the
tinc daemon and maybe execute arbitrary code.


Note that on Wheezy and Sid, tinc is built using hardening flags and
especially stack smashing protection, which should help protect against
arbitrary code execution.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.13-1+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.19-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.19-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your tinc packages.
