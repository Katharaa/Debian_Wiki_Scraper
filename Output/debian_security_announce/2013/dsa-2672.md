DSA-2672-1 kfreebsd-9 -- interpretation conflict
------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
22 May 2013
Affected Packages:

[kfreebsd-9](https://packages.debian.org/src:kfreebsd-9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 706414](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=706414).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-3266](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3266).  

More information:

Adam Nowacki discovered that the new FreeBSD NFS implementation
processes a crafted READDIR request which instructs to operate a file
system on a file node as if it were a directory node, leading to a
kernel crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.


The kfreebsd-8 kernel in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) does not
enable the new NFS implementation. The Linux kernel is not affected
by this vulnerability.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.0-10+deb70.1.


For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 9.0-11.


We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-9 packages.
