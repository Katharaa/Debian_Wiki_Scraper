* [CVE-2013-0213](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0213):
Clickjacking issue in SWAT

 An attacker can integrate a SWAT page into a malicious web page via a
 frame or iframe and then overlaid by other content. If an
 authenticated valid user interacts with this malicious web page, she
 might perform unintended changes in the Samba settings.
* [CVE-2013-0214](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0214):
Potential Cross-site request forgery

 An attacker can persuade a valid SWAT user, who is logged in as root,
 to click in a malicious link and trigger arbitrary unintended changes
 in the Samba settings. In order to be vulnerable, the attacker needs
 to know the victim's password.
