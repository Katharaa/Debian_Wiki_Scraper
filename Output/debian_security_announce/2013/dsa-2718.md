More information:

Several vulnerabilities were identified in WordPress, a web blogging
tool. As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and
specific fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to
upgrade the wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead of
backporting the patches.


This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way. We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.


* [CVE-2013-2173](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2173)
A denial of service was found in the way WordPress performs hash
 computation when checking password for protected posts. An attacker
 supplying carefully crafted input as a password could make the
 platform use excessive CPU usage.
* [CVE-2013-2199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2199)
Multiple server-side requests forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities were
 found in the HTTP API. This is related to
 [CVE-2013-0235](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0235),
 which was specific to SSRF in pingback requests and was fixed in 3.5.1.
* [CVE-2013-2200](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2200)
Inadequate checking of a user's capabilities could lead to a
 privilege escalation, enabling them to publish posts when their
 user role should not allow for it and to assign posts to other
 authors.
* [CVE-2013-2201](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2201)
Multiple cross-side scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to badly
 escaped input were found in the media files and plugins upload forms.
* [CVE-2013-2202](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2202)
XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability via oEmbed
 responses.
* [CVE-2013-2203](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2203)
A Full path disclosure (FPD) was found in the file upload mechanism.
 If the upload directory is not writable, the error message returned
 includes the full directory path.
* [CVE-2013-2204](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2204)
Content spoofing via Flash applet in the embedded tinyMCE media
 plugin.
* [CVE-2013-2205](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2205)
Cross-domain XSS in the embedded SWFupload uploader.
