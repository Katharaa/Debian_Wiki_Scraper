========================


DSA-2830-1 ruby-i18n -- cross-site scripting
--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 Dec 2013
Affected Packages:

[ruby-i18n](https://packages.debian.org/src:ruby-i18n)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-4492](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4492).  

More information:

Peter McLarnan discovered that the internationalization component of
Ruby on Rails does not properly encode parameters in generated HTML
code, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This update
corrects the underlying vulnerability in the i18n gem, as provided by
the ruby-i18n package.


The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem;
the libi18n-ruby package does not contain the vulnerable code.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.0-3+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.9-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-i18n packages.
