More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2013-0231](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0231)
Jan Beulich provided a fix for an issue in the Xen PCI backend drivers.
 Users of guests on a system using passed-through PCI devices can create
 a denial of service of the host system due to the use of non-ratelimited
 kernel log messages.
* [CVE-2013-0871](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0871)
Suleiman Souhlal and Salman Qazi of Google, with help from Aaron Durbin
 and Michael Davidson of Google, discovered an issue in the
 ptrace subsystem. Due to a race condition with PTRACE\_SETREGS, local users
 can cause kernel stack corruption and execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-48squeeze1.


The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:





|  | Debian 6.0 (squeeze) |
