More information:

It was discovered that roundcube, a skinnable AJAX based webmail
solution for IMAP servers, does not properly sanitize the \_session
parameter in steps/utils/save\_pref.inc during saving preferences. The
vulnerability can be exploited to overwrite configuration settings and
subsequently allowing random file access, manipulated SQL queries and
even code execution.


roundcube in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by
this problem.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.2-9+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your roundcube packages.
