More information:

A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in icedtea-web, a

language. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an
attacker could cause the plugin to crash or possibly execute arbitrary
code as the user invoking the program.


This problem was initially discovered by Arthur Gerkis and got assigned
[CVE-2012-4540](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4540). Fixes where applied in the 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 branches but
not to the 1.4 branch.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-3~deb7u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-3.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your icedtea-web packages.
