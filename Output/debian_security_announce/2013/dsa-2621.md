More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2013-0166](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0166)
OpenSSL does not properly perform signature verification for OCSP
 responses, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service via an invalid key.
* [CVE-2013-0169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0169)
A timing side channel attack has been found in CBC padding
 allowing an attacker to recover pieces of plaintext via statistical
 analysis of crafted packages, known as the Lucky Thirteen issue.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.8o-4squeeze14.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
