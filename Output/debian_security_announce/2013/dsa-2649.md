DSA-2649-1 lighttpd -- fixed socket name in world-writable directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
15 Mar 2013
Affected Packages:

[lighttpd](https://packages.debian.org/src:lighttpd)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-1427](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1427).  

More information:

Stefan BÃ¼hler discovered that the Debian specific configuration file for
lighttpd webserver FastCGI PHP support used a fixed socket name in the
world-writable /tmp directory. A symlink attack or a race condition could be
exploited by a malicious user on the same machine to take over the PHP control
socket and for example force the webserver to use a different PHP version.


As the fix is in a configuration file lying in /etc, the update won't be
enforced if the file has been modified by the administrator. In that case, care
should be taken to manually apply the fix.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.28-2+squeeze1.3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.31-4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.31-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.
