DSA-2628-1 nss-pam-ldapd -- buffer overflow
-------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Jun 2013
Affected Packages:

[nss-pam-ldapd](https://packages.debian.org/src:nss-pam-ldapd)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 690319](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=690319).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-0288](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0288).  

More information:

Garth Mollett discovered that a file descriptor overflow issue in the
use of FD\_SET() in nss-pam-ldapd, which provides NSS and PAM modules for
using LDAP as a naming service, can lead to a stack-based buffer
overflow. An attacker could, under some circumstances, use this flaw to
cause a process that has the NSS or PAM module loaded to crash or
potentially execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (squeeze) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.15+squeeze4.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your nss-pam-ldapd packages.
