---------------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[systemd](https://packages.debian.org/src:systemd)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 725357](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=725357).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-4327](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4327), [CVE-2013-4391](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4391), [CVE-2013-4394](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4394).  

More information:

Multiple security issues in systemd have been discovered by Sebastian
Krahmer and Florian Weimer: Insecure interaction with DBUS could lead
to the bypass of Policykit restrictions and privilege escalation or
denial of service through an integer overflow in journald and missing
input sanitising in the processing of X keyboard extension (XKB) files.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 44-11+deb7u4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your systemd packages.
