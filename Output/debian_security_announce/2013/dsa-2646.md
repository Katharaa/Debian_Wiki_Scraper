More information:

TYPO3, a PHP-based content management system, was found vulnerable to several vulnerabilities.


* [CVE-2013-1842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1842)
Helmut Hummel and Markus Opahle discovered that the Extbase database layer
 was not correctly sanitizing user input when using the Query object model.
 This can lead to SQL injection by a malicious user inputing crafted
 relation values.
* [CVE-2013-1843](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1843)
Missing user input validation in the access tracking mechanism could lead
 to arbitrary URL redirection.
