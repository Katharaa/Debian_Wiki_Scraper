========================


DSA-2791-1 tryton-client -- missing input sanitization
------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
04 Nov 2013
Affected Packages:

[tryton-client](https://packages.debian.org/src:tryton-client)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-4510](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4510).  

More information:

Cedric Krier discovered that the Tryton client does not sanitize the
file extension supplied by the server when processing reports. As a
result, a malicious server could send a report with a crafted file
extension that causes the client to write any local file to which the
user running the client has write access.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.1-1+deb6u1.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.3-1+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your tryton-client packages.
