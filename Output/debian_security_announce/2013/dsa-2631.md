Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 696187](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=696187).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-5643](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5643), [CVE-2013-0189](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0189).  

More information:

Squid3, a fully featured Web proxy cache, is prone to a denial of
service attack due to memory consumption caused by memory leaks in
cachemgr.cgi:


* [CVE-2012-5643](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5643)
squid's cachemgr.cgi was vulnerable to excessive resource use.
 A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to perform a denial of
 service attack on the server and other hosted services.
* [CVE-2013-0189](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0189)
The original patch for [CVE-2012-5643](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5643)
 was incomplete. A remote attacker still could exploit this flaw
 to perform a denial of service attack.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.6-1.2+squeeze3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.20-2.1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.20-2.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.
