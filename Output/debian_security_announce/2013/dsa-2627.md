Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2627-1 nginx -- information leak
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
17 Feb 2013
Affected Packages:

[nginx](https://packages.debian.org/src:nginx)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 700426](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=700426).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-4929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4929).  

More information:

Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong discovered a weakness in the TLS/SSL
protocol when using compression. This side channel attack, dubbed
CRIME, allows eavesdroppers to gather information to recover the
original plaintext in the protocol. This update to nginx disables
SSL compression.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.67-3+squeeze3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 1.1.16-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.
