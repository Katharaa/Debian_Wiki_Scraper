--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
19 Sep 2013
Affected Packages:

[puppet](https://packages.debian.org/src:puppet)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-4761](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4761), [CVE-2013-4956](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4956).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in puppet, a centralized
configuration management system. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2013-4761](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4761)
The resource\_type service (disabled by default) could be used to
 make puppet load arbitrary Ruby code from puppet master's file
 system.
* [CVE-2013-4956](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4956)
Modules installed with the Puppet Module Tool might be installed
 with weak permissions, possibly allowing local users to read or
 modify them.


The stable distribution (wheezy) has been updated to version 2.7.33 of
puppet. This version includes the patches for all the previous DSAs
related to puppet in wheezy. In this version, the puppet report format
is now correctly reported as version 3.


It is to be expected that future DSAs for puppet update to a newer,
bug fix-only, release of the 2.7 branch.


The oldstable distribution (squeeze) has not been updated for this
advisory: as of this time there is no fix for
[CVE-2013-4761](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4761)
and the package is not affected by
[CVE-2013-4956](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4956).


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.23-1~deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 3.2.4-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.
