-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
12 May 2013
Affected Packages:

[xen](https://packages.debian.org/src:xen)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-1918](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1918), [CVE-2013-1952](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1952), [CVE-2013-1964](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1964).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:


* [CVE-2013-1918](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1918)

([XSA
45](http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2013-05/msg00000.html)) several long latency operations are not preemptible.



Some page table manipulation operations for PV guests were not made
 preemptible, allowing a malicious or buggy PV guest kernel to mount a
 denial of service attack affecting the whole system.
* [CVE-2013-1952](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1952)

([XSA
49](http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2013-05/msg00001.html)) VT-d interrupt remapping source validation flaw for bridges.



Due to missing source validation on interrupt remapping table
 entries for MSI interrupts set up by bridge devices, a malicious
 domain with access to such a device can mount a denial of service
 attack affecting the whole system.
* [CVE-2013-1964](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1964)

([XSA
50](http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2013-04/msg00006.html)) grant table hypercall acquire/release imbalance.



When releasing a particular, non-transitive grant after doing a grant
 copy operation, Xen incorrectly releases an unrelated grant
 reference, leading possibly to a crash of the host system.
 Furthermore information leakage or privilege escalation cannot be
 ruled out.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.1-5.11.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-3+deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-4.


Note that for the stable (wheezy), testing and unstable distribution,
[CVE-2013-1964](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1964)
([XSA
50](http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2013-04/msg00006.html)) was already fixed in version 4.1.4-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.
