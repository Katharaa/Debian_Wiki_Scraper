More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Subversion, a version control
system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


* [CVE-2013-1968](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1968)
Subversion repositories with the FSFS repository data store format
 can be corrupted by newline characters in filenames. A remote
 attacker with a malicious client could use this flaw to disrupt the
 service for other users using that repository.
* [CVE-2013-2112](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2112)
Subversion's svnserve server process may exit when an incoming TCP
 connection is closed early in the connection process. A remote
 attacker can cause svnserve to exit and thus deny service to users
 of the server.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.12dfsg-7.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.17dfsg-4+deb7u3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.
