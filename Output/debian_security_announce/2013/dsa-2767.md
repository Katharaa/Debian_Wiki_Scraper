--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
29 Sep 2013
Affected Packages:

[proftpd-dfsg](https://packages.debian.org/src:proftpd-dfsg)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 723179](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=723179).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-4359](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4359).  

More information:

Kingcope discovered that the mod\_sftp and mod\_sftp\_pam modules of
proftpd, a powerful modular FTP/SFTP/FTPS server, are not properly
validating input, before making pool allocations. An attacker can
use this flaw to conduct denial of service attacks against the system
running proftpd (resource exhaustion).


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.3a-6squeeze7.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.4a-5+deb7u1.


For the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem will
be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your proftpd-dfsg packages.
