More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Chromium web browser.
Multiple use-after-free, out-of-bounds read, memory safety, and
cross-site scripting issues were discovered and corrected.


* [CVE-2013-2837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2837)
Use-after-free vulnerability in the SVG implementation allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via unknown vectors.
* [CVE-2013-2838](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2838)
Google V8, as used in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93, allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read)
 via unspecified vectors.
* [CVE-2013-2839](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2839)
Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 does not properly perform a cast
 of an unspecified variable during handling of clipboard data, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
 have other impact via unknown vectors.
* [CVE-2013-2840](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2840)
Use-after-free vulnerability in the media loader in Chromium
 before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown
 vectors, a different vulnerability than [CVE-2013-2846](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2846).
* [CVE-2013-2841](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2841)
Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of
 Pepper resources.
* [CVE-2013-2842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2842)
Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of
 widgets.
* [CVE-2013-2843](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2843)
Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of
 speech data.
* [CVE-2013-2844](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2844)
Use-after-free vulnerability in the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
 implementation in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via vectors related to style resolution.
* [CVE-2013-2845](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2845)
The Web Audio implementation in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
 corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown
 vectors.
* [CVE-2013-2846](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2846)
Use-after-free vulnerability in the media loader in Chromium
 before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown
 vectors, a different vulnerability than [CVE-2013-2840](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2840).
* [CVE-2013-2847](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2847)
Race condition in the workers implementation in Chromium before
 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (use-after-free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via unknown vectors.
* [CVE-2013-2848](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2848)
The XSS Auditor in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 might allow
 remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via unspecified
 vectors.
* [CVE-2013-2849](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2849)
Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Chromium
 before 27.0.1453.93 allow user-assisted remote attackers to inject
 arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving a (1)
 drag-and-drop or (2) copy-and-paste operation.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), the security support window
for Chromium has ended. Users of Chromium on oldstable are very highly
encouraged to upgrade to the current stable Debian release (wheezy).
Chromium security support for wheezy will last until the next stable
release (jessie), which is expected to happen sometime in 2015.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 27.0.1453.93-1~deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 27.0.1453.93-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your chromium-browser packages.
