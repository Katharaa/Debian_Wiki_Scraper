DSA-2778-1 libapache2-mod-fcgid -- heap-based buffer overflow
-------------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
12 Oct 2013
Affected Packages:

[libapache2-mod-fcgid](https://packages.debian.org/src:libapache2-mod-fcgid)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-4365](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4365).  

More information:

Robert Matthews discovered that the Apache FCGID module, a FastCGI
implementation for Apache HTTP Server, fails to perform adequate
boundary checks on user-supplied input. This may allow a remote attacker
to cause a heap-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
or potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.6-1+squeeze2.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.6-1.2+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.9-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-fcgid packages.
