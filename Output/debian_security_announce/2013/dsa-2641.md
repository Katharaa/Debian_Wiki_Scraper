Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 702296](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=702296), [Bug 702821](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=702821).

More information:

Yves Orton discovered a flaw in the rehashing code of Perl. This flaw
could be exploited to carry out a denial of service attack against code
that uses arbitrary user input as hash keys. Specifically an attacker
could create a set of keys of a hash causing a denial of service via
memory exhaustion.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.10.1-17squeeze6 of perl and version
2.0.4-7+squeeze1 of libapache2-mod-perl2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 5.14.2-19
of perl and version 2.0.7-3 of libapache2-mod-perl2.


We recommend that you upgrade your perl and libapache2-mod-perl2 packages.
