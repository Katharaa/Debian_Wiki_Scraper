DSA-2715-1 puppet -- code execution
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
26 Jun 2013
Affected Packages:

[puppet](https://packages.debian.org/src:puppet)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-3567](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3567).  

More information:

It was discovered that puppet, a centralized configuration management
system, did not correctly handle YAML payloads. A remote attacker could
use a specially-crafted payload to execute arbitrary code on the puppet
master.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed in
version 2.6.2-5+squeeze8.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.18-5.


For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.
