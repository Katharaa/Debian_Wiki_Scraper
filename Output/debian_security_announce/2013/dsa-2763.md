------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 Sep 2013
Affected Packages:

[pyopenssl](https://packages.debian.org/src:pyopenssl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 722055](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=722055).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-4314](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4314).  

More information:

It was discovered that PyOpenSSL, a Python wrapper around the OpenSSL
library, does not properly handle certificates with NULL characters in
the Subject Alternative Name field.


A remote attacker in the position to obtain a certificate for
'www.foo.org\0.example.com' from a CA that a SSL client trusts, could
use this to spoof www.foo.org and conduct man-in-the-middle attacks
between the PyOpenSSL-using client and the SSL server.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10-1+squeeze1.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.13-2+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.13-2.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your pyopenssl packages.
