========================


DSA-2660-1 curl -- exposure of sensitive information
----------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
20 Apr 2013
Affected Packages:

[curl](https://packages.debian.org/src:curl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 705274](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=705274).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-1944](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1944).  

More information:

Yamada Yasuharu discovered that cURL, an URL transfer library, is
vulnerable to expose potentially sensitive information when doing
requests across domains with matching tails. Due to a bug in the
tailmatch function when matching domain names, it was possible that
cookies set for a domain ample.com could accidentally also be sent
by libcurl when communicating with example.com.


Both curl the command line tool and applications using the libcurl
library are vulnerable.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.29.0-2.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
