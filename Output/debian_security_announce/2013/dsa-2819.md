========================


DSA-2819-1 iceape -- end-of-life announcement for iceape
--------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
16 Dec 2013
Affected Packages:

[iceape](https://packages.debian.org/src:iceape)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
No other external database security references currently available.
More information:

Security support for Iceape, the Debian-branded version of the Seamonkey
suite needed to be stopped before the end of the regular security maintenance
life cycle.


We recommend to migrate to Iceweasel for the web browser functionality and
to Icedove for the e-mail bits. Iceweasel and Icedove are based on the same
codebase and will continue to be supported with security updates. Alternatively
you can switch to the binaries provided by Mozilla available at
<http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/>
