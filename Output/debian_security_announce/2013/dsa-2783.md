More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Rack, a modular Ruby
webserver interface. The Common Vulnerabilites and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:


* [CVE-2011-5036](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-5036)
Rack computes hash values for form parameters without restricting
 the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)
 by sending many crafted parameters.
* [CVE-2013-0183](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0183)
A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (memory
 consumption and out-of-memory error) via a long string in a
 Multipart HTTP packet.
* [CVE-2013-0184](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0184)
A vulnerability in Rack::Auth::AbstractRequest allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service via unknown vectors.
* [CVE-2013-0263](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0263)
Rack::Session::Cookie allows remote attackers to guess the
 session cookie, gain privileges, and execute arbitrary code via a
 timing attack involving an HMAC comparison function that does not
 run in constant time.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.0-4+squeeze1.


The stable, testing and unstable distributions do not contain the
librack-ruby package. They have already been addressed in version
1.4.1-2.1 of the ruby-rack package.


We recommend that you upgrade your librack-ruby packages.
