DSA-2664-1 stunnel4 -- buffer overflow
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
02 May 2013
Affected Packages:

[stunnel4](https://packages.debian.org/src:stunnel4)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 702267](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=702267).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-1762](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1762).  

More information:

Stunnel, a program designed to work as an universal SSL tunnel for
network daemons, is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability when using
the Microsoft NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication
(protocolAuthentication = NTLM) together with the connect
protocol method (protocol = connect). With these prerequisites
and using stunnel4 in SSL client mode (client = yes) on a 64 bit
host, an attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the stunnel process, if the attacker can either control
the specified proxy server or perform man-in-the-middle attacks on the
tcp session between stunnel and the proxy sever.


Note that for the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable
distribution (sid), stunnel4 is compiled with stack smashing protection
enabled, which should help protect against arbitrary code execution.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3:4.29-1+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3:4.53-1.1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3:4.53-1.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your stunnel4 packages.
