========================


DSA-2775-1 ejabberd -- insecure SSL usage
-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Oct 2013
Affected Packages:

[ejabberd](https://packages.debian.org/src:ejabberd)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 722105](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=722105).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-6169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6169).  

More information:

It was discovered that ejabberd, a Jabber/XMPP server, uses SSLv2 and
weak ciphers for communication, which are considered insecure. The
software offers no runtime configuration options to disable these. This
update disables the use of SSLv2 and weak ciphers.


The updated package for Debian 7 (wheezy) also contains auxiliary
bugfixes originally staged for the next stable point release.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.5-3+squeeze2.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.10-4+deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie), and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your ejabberd packages.
