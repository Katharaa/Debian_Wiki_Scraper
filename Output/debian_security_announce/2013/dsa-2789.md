DSA-2789-1 strongswan -- Denial of service and authorization bypass
-------------------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
01 Nov 2013
Affected Packages:

[strongswan](https://packages.debian.org/src:strongswan)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-6075](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6075).  

More information:

A vulnerability has been found in the ASN.1 parser of strongSwan, an IKE
daemon used to establish IPsec protected links.


By sending a crafted ID\_DER\_ASN1\_DN ID payload to a vulnerable pluto or
charon daemon, a malicious remote user can provoke a denial of service
(daemon crash) or an authorization bypass (impersonating a different
user, potentially acquiring VPN permissions she doesn't have).


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.4.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u2.


For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.0-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.0-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.
