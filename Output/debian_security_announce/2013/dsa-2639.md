More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, the web scripting
language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following issues:


* [CVE-2013-1635](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1635)
If a PHP application accepted untrusted SOAP object input remotely
 from clients, an attacker could read system files readable for the
 webserver.
* [CVE-2013-1643](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1643)
The soap.wsdl\_cache\_dir function did not take PHP open\_basedir
 restrictions into account. Note that Debian advises against relying
 on open\_basedir restrictions for security.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze15.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
