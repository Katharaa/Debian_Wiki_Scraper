More information:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Ruby on Rails, a Ruby framework
for web application development.


* [CVE-2013-0276](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0276)
The blacklist provided by the attr\_protected method could be
 bypassed with crafted requests, having an application-specific
 impact.
* [CVE-2013-0277](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0277)
In some applications, the +serialize+ helper in ActiveRecord
 could be tricked into deserializing arbitrary YAML data,
 possibly leading to remote code execution.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze7.


We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.
