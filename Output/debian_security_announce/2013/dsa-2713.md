More information:

Timo Sirainen discovered that cURL, an URL transfer library, is prone to
a heap overflow vulnerability due to bad checking of the input data in
the curl\_easy\_unescape function.


The curl command line tool is not affected by this problem as it doesn't
use the curl\_easy\_unescape function.
