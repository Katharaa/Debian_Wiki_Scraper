Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2600-1 cups -- privilege escalation
---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
06 Jan 2013
Affected Packages:

[cups](https://packages.debian.org/src:cups)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 692791](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=692791).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-5519](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5519).  

More information:

Jann Horn discovered that users of the CUPS printing system who are part
of the lpadmin group could modify several configuration parameters with
security impact. Specifically, this allows an attacker to read or write
arbitrary files as root which can be used to elevate privileges.


This update splits the configuration file /etc/cups/cupsd.conf into two
files: cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf. While the first stays configurable
via the web interface, the latter can only be configured by the root user.
Please see the updated documentation that comes with the new package
for more information on these files.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-7+squeeze2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.3-2.7.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.3-2.7.


We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.
