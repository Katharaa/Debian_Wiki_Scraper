More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in PolarSSL. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2013-0169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0169)
A timing side channel attack has been found in CBC padding
 allowing an attacker to recover pieces of plaintext via statistical
 analysis of crafted packages, known as the Lucky Thirteen issue.
* [CVE-2013-1621](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1621)
An array index error might allow remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service via vectors involving a crafted padding-length value
 during validation of CBC padding in a TLS session.
* [CVE-2013-1622](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1622)
Malformed CBC data in a TLS session could allow remote attackers to
 conduct distinguishing attacks via statistical analysis of timing
 side-channel data for crafted packets.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.1-1squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.1.4-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.
