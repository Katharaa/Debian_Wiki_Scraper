In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-2153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2153), [CVE-2013-2154](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2154), [CVE-2013-2155](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2155), [CVE-2013-2156](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2156).  

More information:

James Forshaw from Context Information Security discovered several
vulnerabilities in xml-security-c, an implementation of the XML Digital
Security specification. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2013-2153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2153)
The implementation of XML digital signatures in the Santuario-C++
 library is vulnerable to a spoofing issue allowing an attacker to
 reuse existing signatures with arbitrary content.
* [CVE-2013-2154](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2154)
A stack overflow, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution,
 exists in the processing of malformed XPointer expressions in the
 XML Signature Reference processing code.
* [CVE-2013-2155](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2155)
A bug in the processing of the output length of an HMAC-based XML
 Signature would cause a denial of service when processing specially
 chosen input.
* [CVE-2013-2156](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2156)
A heap overflow exists in the processing of the PrefixList attribute
 optionally used in conjunction with Exclusive Canonicalization,
 potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.1-3+squeeze2.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.1-5+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.1-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your xml-security-c packages.
