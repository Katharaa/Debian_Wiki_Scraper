-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 Mar 2013
Affected Packages:

[bind9](https://packages.debian.org/src:bind9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 704174](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=704174).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-2266](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2266).  

More information:

Matthew Horsfall of Dyn, Inc. discovered that BIND, a DNS server, is
prone to a denial of service vulnerability. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to send a specially-crafted DNS query to named that, when
processed, would cause named to use an excessive amount of memory, or
possibly crash.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze10.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu1.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
