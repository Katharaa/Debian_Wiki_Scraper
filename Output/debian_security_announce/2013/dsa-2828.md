DSA-2828-1 drupal6 -- several vulnerabilities
---------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
28 Dec 2013
Affected Packages:

[drupal6](https://packages.debian.org/src:drupal6)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-6385](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6385), [CVE-2013-6386](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6386).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Drupal, a fully-featured
content management framework: vulnerabilities due to optimistic cross-site
request forgery protection, insecure pseudo random number generation, code
execution and incorrect security token validation.


In order to avoid the remote code execution vulnerability, it is
recommended to create a .htaccess file (or an equivalent configuration
directive in case you are not using Apache to serve your Drupal sites)
in each of your sites' files directories (both public and private, in
case you have both configured).


Please refer to the NEWS file provided with this update and the upstream
advisory at [drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-003](https://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-003) for further information.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.29-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your drupal6 packages.
