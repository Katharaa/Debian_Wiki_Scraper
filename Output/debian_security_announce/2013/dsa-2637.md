Hayawardh Vijayakumar noticed that the apache2ctl script created
 the lock directory in an unsafe manner, allowing a local attacker
 to gain elevated privileges via a symlink attack. This is a Debian
 specific issue.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.16-6+squeeze11.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.2.22-13.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.2.22-13.


We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
