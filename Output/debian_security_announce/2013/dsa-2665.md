========================


DSA-2665-1 strongswan -- authentication bypass
----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 Apr 2013
Affected Packages:

[strongswan](https://packages.debian.org/src:strongswan)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-2944](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2944).  

More information:

Kevin Wojtysiak discovered a vulnerability in strongSwan, an IPsec
based VPN solution.


When using the OpenSSL plugin for ECDSA based authentication, an empty,
zeroed or otherwise invalid signature is handled as a legitimate one.
An attacker could use a forged signature to authenticate like a legitimate
user and gain access to the VPN (and everything protected by this).


While the issue looks like [CVE-2012-2388](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2388)
(RSA signature based authentication bypass), it is unrelated.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.6.4-7.


We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.
