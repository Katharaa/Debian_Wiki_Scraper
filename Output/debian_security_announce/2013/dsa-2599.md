Affected Packages:

[nss](https://packages.debian.org/src:nss)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-0743](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0743).  

More information:

Google, Inc. discovered that the TurkTrust certification authority
included in the Network Security Service libraries (nss) mis-issued
two intermediate CAs which could be used to generate rogue end-entity
certificates. This update explicitly distrusts those two intermediate
CAs. The two existing TurkTrust root CAs remain active.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.8-1+squeeze6.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.13.6-2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.14.1.with.ckbi.1.93-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.
