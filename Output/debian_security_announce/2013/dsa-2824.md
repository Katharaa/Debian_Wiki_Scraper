----------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
19 Dec 2013
Affected Packages:

[curl](https://packages.debian.org/src:curl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-6422](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6422).  

More information:

Marc Deslauriers discovered that curl, a file retrieval tool, would
mistakenly skip verifying the CN and SAN name fields when digital
signature verification was disabled in the libcurl GnuTLS backend.


The default configuration for the curl package is not affected by this
issue since the digital signature verification is enabled by default.


The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy7.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.34.0-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
