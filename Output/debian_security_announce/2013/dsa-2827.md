More information:

It was discovered that Apache Commons FileUpload, a package to make it
easy to add robust, high-performance, file upload capability to servlets
and web applications, incorrectly handled file names with NULL bytes in
serialized instances. A remote attacker able to supply a serialized
instance of the DiskFileItem class, which will be deserialized on a
server, could use this flaw to write arbitrary content to any location
on the server that is accessible to the user running the application
server process.
