Affected Packages:

[passenger](https://packages.debian.org/src:passenger)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 884463](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=884463).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-16355](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16355).  

More information:

An arbitrary file read vulnerability was discovered in passenger, a web
application server. A local user allowed to deploy an application to
passenger, can take advantage of this flaw by creating a symlink from
the REVISION file to an arbitrary file on the system and have its
content displayed through passenger-status.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.30-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your passenger packages.
