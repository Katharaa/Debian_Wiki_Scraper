More information:

Fabien Potencier discovered that twig, a template engine for PHP, did
not correctly enforce sandboxing. This could result in potential
information disclosure.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.24.0-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your twig packages.
