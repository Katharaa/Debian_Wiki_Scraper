DSA-4475-1 openssl -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
01 Jul 2019
Affected Packages:

[openssl](https://packages.debian.org/src:openssl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-1543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1543).  

More information:

Joran Dirk Greef discovered that overly long nonces used with
ChaCha20-Poly1305 were incorrectly processed and could result in nonce
reuse. This doesn't affect OpenSSL-internal uses of ChaCha20-Poly1305
such as TLS.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.0k-1~deb9u1. This DSA also upgrades openssl1.0 (which
itself is not affected by [CVE-2019-1543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1543)) to 1.0.2s-1~deb9u1


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
