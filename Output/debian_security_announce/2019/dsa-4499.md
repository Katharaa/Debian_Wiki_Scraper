Netanel reported that the .buildfont1 procedure in Ghostscript, the GPL
PostScript/PDF interpreter, does not properly restrict privileged calls,
which could result in bypass of file system restrictions of the dSAFER
sandbox.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 9.26a~dfsg-0+deb9u4.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.
