Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-12046](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12046).  

More information:

It was discovered that the Lemonldap::NG web SSO system performed
insufficient validation of session tokens if the tokenUseGlobalStorage
option is enabled, which could grant users with access to the main
session database access to an anonymous session.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.7-3+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your lemonldap-ng packages.
