More information:

Several issues have been discovered in Apache module auth\_mellon, which
provides SAML 2.0 authentication.


* [CVE-2019-3877](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3877)
It was possible to bypass the redirect URL checking on logout, so
 the module could be used as an open redirect facility.
* [CVE-2019-3878](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3878)
When mod\_auth\_mellon is used in an Apache configuration which
 serves as a remote proxy with the http\_proxy module, it was
 possible to bypass authentication by sending SAML ECP headers.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.0-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-auth-mellon packages.
