------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[coturn](https://packages.debian.org/src:coturn)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-4056](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-4056), [CVE-2018-4058](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-4058), [CVE-2018-4059](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-4059).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in coTURN, a TURN and STUN server for
VoIP.


* [CVE-2018-4056](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-4056)
An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in the coTURN administrator
 web portal. As the administration web interface is shared with the
 production, it is unfortunately not possible to easily filter outside
 access and this security update completely disable the web interface. Users
 should use the local, command line interface instead.
* [CVE-2018-4058](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-4058)
Default configuration enables unsafe loopback forwarding. A remote attacker
 with access to the TURN interface can use this vulnerability to gain access
 to services that should be local only.
* [CVE-2018-4059](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-4059)
Default configuration uses an empty password for the local command line
 administration interface. An attacker with access to the local console
 (either a local attacker or a remote attacker taking advantage of
 [CVE-2018-4058](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-4058))
 could escalade privileges to administrator of the coTURN
 server.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.0.5-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your coturn packages.
