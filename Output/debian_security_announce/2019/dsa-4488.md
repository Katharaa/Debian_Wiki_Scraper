DSA-4488-1 exim4 -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
25 Jul 2019
Affected Packages:

[exim4](https://packages.debian.org/src:exim4)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-13917](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13917).  

More information:

Jeremy Harris discovered that Exim, a mail transport agent, does not
properly handle the ${sort } expansion. This flaw can be exploited by a
remote attacker to execute programs with root privileges in non-default
(and unusual) configurations where ${sort } expansion is used for items
that can be controlled by an attacker.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.89-2+deb9u5.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.92-8+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your exim4 packages.
