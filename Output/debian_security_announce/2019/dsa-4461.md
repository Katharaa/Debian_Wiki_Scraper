Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-0201](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0201).  

More information:

Harrison Neil discovered that the getACL() command in Zookeeper, a
service for maintaining configuration information, did not validate
permissions, which could result in information disclosure.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.9-3+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your zookeeper packages.
