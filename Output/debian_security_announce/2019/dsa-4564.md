Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-12207](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12207), [CVE-2019-0154](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0154), [CVE-2019-0155](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0155), [CVE-2019-11135](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11135).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leak.


* [CVE-2018-12207](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12207)
It was discovered that on Intel CPUs supporting hardware
 virtualisation with Extended Page Tables (EPT), a guest VM may
 manipulate the memory management hardware to cause a Machine Check
 Error (MCE) and denial of service (hang or crash).


The guest triggers this error by changing page tables without a
 TLB flush, so that both 4 KB and 2 MB entries for the same virtual
 address are loaded into the instruction TLB (iTLB). This update
 implements a mitigation in KVM that prevents guest VMs from
 loading 2 MB entries into the iTLB. This will reduce performance
 of guest VMs.


Further information on the mitigation can be found at
 <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/multihit.html>
 or in the linux-doc-4.9 or linux-doc-4.19 package.


A qemu update adding support for the PSCHANGE\_MC\_NO feature, which
 allows to disable iTLB Multihit mitigations in nested hypervisors
 will be provided via DSA 4566-1.

* [CVE-2019-0154](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0154)
Intel discovered that on their 8th and 9th generation GPUs,
 reading certain registers while the GPU is in a low-power state
 can cause a system hang. A local user permitted to use the GPU
 can use this for denial of service.


This update mitigates the issue through changes to the i915
 driver.


The affected chips (gen8 and gen9) are listed at
 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_graphics_processing_units#Gen8>.
* [CVE-2019-0155](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0155)
Intel discovered that their 9th generation and newer GPUs are
 missing a security check in the Blitter Command Streamer (BCS). A
 local user permitted to use the GPU could use this to access any
 memory that the GPU has access to, which could result in a denial
 of service (memory corruption or crash), a leak of sensitive
 information, or privilege escalation.


This update mitigates the issue by adding the security check to
 the i915 driver.


The affected chips (gen9 onward) are listed at
 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_graphics_processing_units#Gen9>.
* [CVE-2019-11135](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11135)
It was discovered that on Intel CPUs supporting transactional
 memory (TSX), a transaction that is going to be aborted may
 continue to execute speculatively, reading sensitive data from
 internal buffers and leaking it through dependent operations.
 Intel calls this TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA).


For CPUs affected by the previously published Microarchitectural
 Data Sampling (MDS) issues
 ([CVE-2018-12126](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12126),
 [CVE-2018-12127](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12127),
 [CVE-2018-12130](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12130),
 [CVE-2019-11091](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11091)),
 the existing mitigation also mitigates this issue.


For processors that are vulnerable to TAA but not MDS, this update
 disables TSX by default. This mitigation requires updated CPU
 microcode. An updated intel-microcode package (only available in
 Debian non-free) will be provided via DSA 4565-1. The updated CPU
 microcode may also be available as part of a system firmware
 ("BIOS") update.


Further information on the mitigation can be found at
 <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/tsx_async_abort.html>
 or in the linux-doc-4.9 or linux-doc-4.19 package.


Intel's explanation of the issue can be found at
 <https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/deep-dive-intel-transactional-synchronization-extensions-intel-tsx-asynchronous-abort>.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.9.189-3+deb9u2.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.19.67-2+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
