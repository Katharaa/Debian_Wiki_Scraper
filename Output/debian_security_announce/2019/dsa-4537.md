DSA-4537-1 file-roller -- security update
-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
28 Sep 2019
Affected Packages:

[file-roller](https://packages.debian.org/src:file-roller)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-16680](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16680).  

More information:

It was discovered that file-roller, an archive manager for GNOME, does
not properly handle the extraction of archives with a single ./../ in a
file path. An attacker able to provide a specially crafted archive for
processing can take advantage of this flaw to overwrite files if a user
is dragging a specific file or map to a location to extract to.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.22.3-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your file-roller packages.
