More information:

It was discovered that various procedures in Ghostscript, the GPL
PostScript/PDF interpreter, do not properly restrict privileged calls,
which could result in bypass of file system restrictions of the dSAFER
sandbox.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 9.26a~dfsg-0+deb9u5.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.27~dfsg-2+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.
