More information:

Multiple security issues were found in PHP, a widely-used open source
general purpose scripting language: The EXIF extension had multiple cases
of invalid memory access and rename() was implemented insecurely.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.0.33-0+deb9u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your php7.0 packages.
