========================


DSA-4428-1 systemd -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
08 Apr 2019
Affected Packages:

[systemd](https://packages.debian.org/src:systemd)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-3842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3842).  

More information:

Jann Horn discovered that the PAM module in systemd insecurely uses the
environment and lacks seat verification permitting spoofing an active
session to PolicyKit. A remote attacker with SSH access can take
advantage of this issue to gain PolicyKit privileges that are normally
only granted to clients in an active session on the local console.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 232-25+deb9u11.


This update includes updates previously scheduled to be released in the
stretch 9.9 point release.


We recommend that you upgrade your systemd packages.
