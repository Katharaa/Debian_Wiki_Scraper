Manfred Paul and Lukas Schauer reported that the .charkeys procedure in
Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF interpreter, does not properly
restrict privileged calls, which could result in bypass of file system
restrictions of the dSAFER sandbox.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 9.26a~dfsg-0+deb9u6.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
