Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-14821](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14821), [CVE-2019-14835](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14835), [CVE-2019-15117](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15117), [CVE-2019-15118](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15118), [CVE-2019-15902](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15902).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2019-14821](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14821)
Matt Delco reported a race condition in KVM's coalesced MMIO
 facility, which could lead to out-of-bounds access in the kernel.
 A local attacker permitted to access /dev/kvm could use this to
 cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
 for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2019-14835](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14835)
Peter Pi of Tencent Blade Team discovered a missing bounds check
 in vhost\_net, the network back-end driver for KVM hosts, leading
 to a buffer overflow when the host begins live migration of a VM.
 An attacker in control of a VM could use this to cause a denial of
 service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
 escalation on the host.
* [CVE-2019-15117](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15117)
Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported a missing bounds check in the
 usb-audio driver's descriptor parsing code, leading to a buffer
 over-read. An attacker able to add USB devices could possibly use
 this to cause a denial of service (crash).
* [CVE-2019-15118](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15118)
Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported unbounded recursion in the
 usb-audio driver's descriptor parsing code, leading to a stack
 overflow. An attacker able to add USB devices could use this to
 cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
 for privilege escalation. On the amd64 architecture, and on the
 arm64 architecture in buster, this is mitigated by a guard page
 on the kernel stack, so that it is only possible to cause a crash.
* [CVE-2019-15902](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15902)
Brad Spengler reported that a backporting error reintroduced a
 spectre-v1 vulnerability in the ptrace subsystem in the
 ptrace\_get\_debugreg() function.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.9.189-3+deb9u1.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.19.67-2+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
