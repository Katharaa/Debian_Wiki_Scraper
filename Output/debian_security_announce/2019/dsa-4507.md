More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Squid, a fully featured web
proxy cache. The flaws in the HTTP Digest Authentication processing, the
HTTP Basic Authentication processing and in the cachemgr.cgi allowed
remote attackers to perform denial of service and cross-site scripting
attacks, and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.6-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your squid packages.
