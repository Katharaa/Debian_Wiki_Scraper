DSA-4577-1 haproxy -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
28 Nov 2019
Affected Packages:

[haproxy](https://packages.debian.org/src:haproxy)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-19330](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19330).  

More information:

Tim DÃ¼sterhus discovered that haproxy, a TCP/HTTP reverse proxy, did
not properly sanitize HTTP headers when converting from HTTP/2 to
HTTP/1. This would allow a remote user to perform CRLF injections.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.19-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.
