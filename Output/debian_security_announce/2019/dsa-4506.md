More information:

Multiple security issues were discovered in QEMU, a fast processor
emulator, which could result in denial of service, the execution of
arbitrary code or bypass of ACLs.


In addition this update fixes a regression which could cause NBD
connections to hang.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u8.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.
