More information:

A vulnerability was discovered in mosquitto, a MQTT version 3.1/3.1.1
compatible message broker, allowing a malicious MQTT client to cause a
denial of service (stack overflow and daemon crash), by sending a
specially crafted SUBSCRIBE packet containing a topic with a extremely
deep hierarchy.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.7-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your mosquitto packages.
