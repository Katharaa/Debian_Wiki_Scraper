More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the OpenJDK Java runtime,
resulting in information disclosure, denial of service or bypass of
sandbox restrictions. In addition the implementation of elliptic curve
cryptography was modernised.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
