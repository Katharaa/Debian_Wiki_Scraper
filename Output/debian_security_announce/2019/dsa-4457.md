---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Jun 2019
Affected Packages:

[evolution](https://packages.debian.org/src:evolution)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 924616](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=924616).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-15587](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-15587).  

More information:

Hanno BÃ¶ck discovered that Evolution was vulnerable to OpenPGP
signatures being spoofed for arbitrary messages using a specially
crafted HTML email. This issue was mitigated by moving the security
bar with encryption and signature information above the message
headers.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.22.6-1+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your evolution packages.
