In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-1348](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1348), [CVE-2019-1349](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1349), [CVE-2019-1352](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1352), [CVE-2019-1353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1353), [CVE-2019-1387](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1387), [CVE-2019-19604](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19604).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in git, a fast, scalable,
distributed revision control system.


* [CVE-2019-1348](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1348)
It was reported that the --export-marks option of git fast-import is
 exposed also via the in-stream command feature export-marks=...,
 allowing to overwrite arbitrary paths.
* [CVE-2019-1387](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1387)
It was discovered that submodule names are not validated strictly
 enough, allowing very targeted attacks via remote code execution
 when performing recursive clones.
* [CVE-2019-19604](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19604)
Joern Schneeweisz reported a vulnerability, where a recursive clone
 followed by a submodule update could execute code contained within
 the repository without the user explicitly having asked for that. It
 is now disallowed for `.gitmodules` to have entries that set
 `submodule.<name>.update=!command`.


In addition this update addresses a number of security issues which are
only an issue if git is operating on an NTFS filesystem ([CVE-2019-1349](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1349),
[CVE-2019-1352](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1352) and [CVE-2019-1353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1353)).


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:2.11.0-3+deb9u5.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.20.1-2+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.
