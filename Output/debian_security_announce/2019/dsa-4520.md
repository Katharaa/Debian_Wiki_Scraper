Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-9512](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9512), [CVE-2019-9514](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9514), [CVE-2019-9515](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9515), [CVE-2019-9518](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9518).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the HTTP/2 code of Apache
Traffic Server, a reverse and forward proxy server, which could result
in denial of service.


The fixes are too intrusive to backport to the version in the oldstable
distribution (stretch). An upgrade to Debian stable (buster) is
recommended instead.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.0.2+ds-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your trafficserver packages.
