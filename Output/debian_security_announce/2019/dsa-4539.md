More information:

Three security issues were discovered in OpenSSL: A timing attack against
ECDSA, a padding oracle in PKCS7\_dataDecode() and CMS\_decrypt\_set1\_pkey()
and it was discovered that a feature of the random number generator (RNG)
intended to protect against shared RNG state between parent and child
processes in the event of a fork() syscall was not used by default.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.0l-1~deb9u1.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.1d-0+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
