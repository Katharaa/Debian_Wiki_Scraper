========================


DSA-4566-1 qemu -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
12 Nov 2019
Affected Packages:

[qemu](https://packages.debian.org/src:qemu)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 944623](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=944623).  

More information:

This update for QEMU, a fast processor emulator, backports support to
passthrough the pschange-mc-no CPU flag. The virtualised MSR seen by a
guest is set to show the bug as fixed, allowing to disable iTLB Multihit
mitigations in nested hypervisors (cf. DSA 4564-1).


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.
