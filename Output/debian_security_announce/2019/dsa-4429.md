More information:

It was discovered that SPIP, a website engine for publishing, did not
properly sanitize its user input. This would allow an authenticated
user to perform arbitrary command execution.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.4-4~deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your spip packages.
