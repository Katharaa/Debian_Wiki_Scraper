Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Subversion, a version control

* [CVE-2018-11782](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-11782)
Ace Olszowka reported that the Subversion's svnserve server process
 may exit when a well-formed read-only request produces a particular
 answer, leading to a denial of service.

Tomas Bortoli reported that the Subversion's svnserve server process
 may exit when a client sends certain sequences of protocol commands.
 If the server is configured with anonymous access enabled this could
 lead to a remote unauthenticated denial of service.

in version 1.9.5-1+deb9u4.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.10.4-1+deb10u1.
