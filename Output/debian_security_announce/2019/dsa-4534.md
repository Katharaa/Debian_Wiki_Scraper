In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-16276](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16276).  

More information:

It was discovered that the Go programming language did accept and
normalize invalid HTTP/1.1 headers with a space before the colon, which
could lead to filter bypasses or request smuggling in some setups.

We recommend that you upgrade your golang-1.11 packages.
