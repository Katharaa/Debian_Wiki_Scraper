More information:

X41 D-Sec discovered that unbound, a validating, recursive, and
caching DNS resolver, did not correctly process some NOTIFY
queries. This could lead to remote denial-of-service by application
crash.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.0-2+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your unbound packages.
