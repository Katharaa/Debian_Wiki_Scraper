Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-10197](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10197).  

More information:

Stefan Metzmacher discovered a flaw in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file, print,
and login server for Unix. Specific combinations of parameters and
permissions can allow user to escape from the share path definition and
see the complete '/' filesystem. Unix permission checks in the kernel
are still enforced.


Details can be found in the upstream advisory at
<https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2019-10197.html>


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:4.9.5+dfsg-5+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
