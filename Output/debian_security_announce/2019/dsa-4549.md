More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser, which could potentially result in the execution of arbitrary
code, information disclosure, cross-site scripting or denial of service.


Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 60.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 68.x releases.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), some additional config changes
to the buildd network are needed (to provide the new Rust-based toolchain
needed by ESR68). Packages will be made available when those are sorted out.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 68.2.0esr-1~deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.
