More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird which could
potentially result in the execution of arbitrary code or denial of
service.


Debian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the 60.x
series has ended, so starting with this update we're now following the
68.x releases.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:68.2.2-1~deb9u1.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:68.2.2-1~deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your thunderbird packages.
