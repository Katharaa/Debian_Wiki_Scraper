DSA-4424-1 pdns -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
04 Apr 2019
Affected Packages:

[pdns](https://packages.debian.org/src:pdns)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 924966](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=924966).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-3871](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3871).  

More information:

Adam Dobrawy, Frederico Silva and Gregory Brzeski from HyperOne.com
discovered that pdns, an authoritative DNS server, did not properly
validate user-supplied data when building a HTTP request from a DNS
query in the HTTP Connector of the Remote backend. This would allow a
remote user to cause either a denial-of-service, or information
disclosure.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.3-1+deb9u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.
