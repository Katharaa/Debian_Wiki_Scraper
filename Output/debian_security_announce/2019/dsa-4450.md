---------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 May 2019
Affected Packages:

[wpa](https://packages.debian.org/src:wpa)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 927463](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=927463).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-11555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11555).  

More information:

A vulnerability was found in the WPA protocol implementation found in
wpa\_supplication (station) and hostapd (access point).


The EAP-pwd implementation in hostapd (EAP server) and wpa\_supplicant (EAP
peer) doesn't properly validate fragmentation reassembly state when receiving
an unexpected fragment. This could lead to a process crash due to a NULL
pointer derefrence.


An attacker in radio range of a station or access point with EAP-pwd support
could cause a crash of the relevant process (wpa\_supplicant or hostapd),
ensuring a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:2.4-1+deb9u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.
