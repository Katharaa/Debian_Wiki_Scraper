DSA-4390-1 flatpak -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
12 Feb 2019
Affected Packages:

[flatpak](https://packages.debian.org/src:flatpak)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 922059](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=922059).  

More information:

It was discovered that Flatpak, an application deployment framework for
desktop apps, insufficiently restricted the execution of apply\_extra
scripts which could potentially result in privilege escalation.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.9-0+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your flatpak packages.
