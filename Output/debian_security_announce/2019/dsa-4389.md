DSA-4389-1 libu2f-host -- security update
-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
11 Feb 2019
Affected Packages:

[libu2f-host](https://packages.debian.org/src:libu2f-host)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 921725](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=921725).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-20340](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20340).  

More information:

Christian Reitter discovered that libu2f-host, a library implementing
the host-side of the U2F protocol, failed to properly check for a
buffer overflow. This would allow an attacker with a custom made
malicious USB device masquerading as a security key, and physical
access to a computer where PAM U2F or an application with libu2f-host
integrated, to potentially execute arbitrary code on that computer.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libu2f-host packages.
