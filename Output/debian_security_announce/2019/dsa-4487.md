DSA-4487-1 neovim -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
23 Jul 2019
Affected Packages:

[neovim](https://packages.debian.org/src:neovim)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-12735](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12735).  

More information:

User Arminius discovered a vulnerability in Vim, an enhanced version of the
standard UNIX editor Vi (Vi IMproved), which also affected the Neovim fork, an
extensible editor focused on modern code and features:


Editors typically provide a way to embed editor configuration commands (aka
modelines) which are executed once a file is opened, while harmful commands
are filtered by a sandbox mechanism. It was discovered that the source
command (used to include and execute another file) was not filtered, allowing
shell command execution with a carefully crafted file opened in Neovim.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.1.7-4+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your neovim packages.
