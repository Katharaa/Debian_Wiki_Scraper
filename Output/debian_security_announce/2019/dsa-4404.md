--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
09 Mar 2019
Affected Packages:

[chromium](https://packages.debian.org/src:chromium)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-5786](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-5786).  

More information:

Clement Lecigne discovered a use-after-free issue in chromium's file
reader implementation. A maliciously crafted file could be used to
remotely execute arbitrary code because of this problem.


This update also fixes a regression introduced in a previous update. The
browser would always crash when launched in remote debugging mode.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 72.0.3626.122-1~deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your chromium packages.
