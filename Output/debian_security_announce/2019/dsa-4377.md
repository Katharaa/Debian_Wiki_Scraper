DSA-4377-1 rssh -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 Jan 2019
Affected Packages:

[rssh](https://packages.debian.org/src:rssh)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 919623](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=919623).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-1000018](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1000018).  

More information:

The ESnet security team discovered a vulnerability in rssh, a restricted
shell that allows users to perform only scp, sftp, cvs, svnserve
(Subversion), rdist and/or rsync operations. Missing validation in the
scp support could result in the bypass of this restriction, allowing the
execution of arbitrary shell commands.


Please note that with the update applied, the -3 option of scp can no
longer be used.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.4-5+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your rssh packages.
