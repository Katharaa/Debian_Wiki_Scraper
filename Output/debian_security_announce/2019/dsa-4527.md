More information:

Multiple security issues were found in PHP, a widely-used open source
general purpose scripting language: Missing sanitising in the EXIF
extension and the iconv\_mime\_decode\_headers() function could result in
information disclosure or denial of service.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.3.9-1~deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php7.3 packages.
