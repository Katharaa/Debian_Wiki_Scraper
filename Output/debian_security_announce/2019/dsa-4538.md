---------------------------------



Date Reported:
29 Sep 2019
Affected Packages:

[wpa](https://packages.debian.org/src:wpa)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 934180](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=934180), [Bug 940080](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=940080).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-13377](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13377), [CVE-2019-16275](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16275).  

More information:

Two vulnerabilities were found in the WPA protocol implementation found in
wpa\_supplication (station) and hostapd (access point).


* [CVE-2019-13377](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13377)
A timing-based side-channel attack against WPA3's Dragonfly handshake when
 using Brainpool curves could be used by an attacker to retrieve the
 password.
* [CVE-2019-16275](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16275)
Insufficient source address validation for some received Management frames
 in hostapd could lead to a denial of service for stations associated to an
 access point. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a
 specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point
 to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection
 to the network.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:2.7+git20190128+0c1e29f-6+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.
