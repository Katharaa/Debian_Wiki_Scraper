Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 930375](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=930375).

More information:

Joe Vennix discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in dbus, an
asynchronous inter-process communication system. The implementation of
the DBUS\_COOKIE\_SHA1 authentication mechanism was susceptible to a
symbolic link attack. A local attacker could take advantage of this flaw
to bypass authentication and connect to a DBusServer with elevated
privileges.


The standard system and session dbus-daemons in their default
configuration are not affected by this vulnerability.


The vulnerability was addressed by upgrading dbus to a new upstream
version 1.10.28 which includes additional fixes.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.28-0+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.
