More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2019-3846](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3846),
 [CVE-2019-10126](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10126)
huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi
 (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of
 service or the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2019-5489](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-5489)
Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari
 Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh
 discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to
 obtain sensitive information from other processes that access the
 same memory-mapped file.
* [CVE-2019-9500](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9500),
 [CVE-2019-9503](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9503)
Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access
 validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), which a
 attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of
 service or the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2019-11477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11477)
Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
 selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely triggerable
 kernel panic.
* [CVE-2019-11478](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11478)
Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
 selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP
 retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive
 resource usage.
* [CVE-2019-11479](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11479)
Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux
 kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of
 which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the
 bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data.


This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS
 (net.ipv4.tcp\_min\_snd\_mss), which by default uses the formerly hard coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know
 that your network requires a lower value.
* [CVE-2019-11486](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11486)
Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the
 Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to
 cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been
 disabled.
* [CVE-2019-11599](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11599)
Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump
 implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local
 user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a
 denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2019-11815](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11815)
It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram
 Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially
 privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where
 it is explicitly loaded.
* [CVE-2019-11833](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11833)
It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes
 uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. A
 local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the
 filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be
 able to use this to obtain sensitive information.
* [CVE-2019-11884](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11884)
It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
 ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. A local
 user with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to
 obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
