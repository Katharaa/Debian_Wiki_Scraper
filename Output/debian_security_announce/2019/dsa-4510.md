In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-11500](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11500).  

More information:

Nick Roessler and Rafi Rubin discovered that the IMAP and ManageSieve
protocol parsers in the Dovecot email server do not properly validate
input (both pre- and post-login). A remote attacker can take advantage
of this flaw to trigger out of bounds heap memory writes, leading to
information leaks or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:2.2.27-3+deb9u5.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.4.1-5+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your dovecot packages.
