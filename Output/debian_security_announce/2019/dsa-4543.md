Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-4543-1 sudo -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
14 Oct 2019
Affected Packages:

[sudo](https://packages.debian.org/src:sudo)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 942322](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=942322).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-14287](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14287).  

More information:

Joe Vennix discovered that sudo, a program designed to provide limited
super user privileges to specific users, when configured to allow a user
to run commands as an arbitrary user via the ALL keyword in a Runas
specification, allows to run commands as root by specifying the user ID
-1 or 4294967295. This could allow a user with sufficient sudo
privileges to run commands as root even if the Runas specification
explicitly disallows root access.


Details can be found in the upstream advisory at
<https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/minus_1_uid.html> .


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.8.19p1-2.1+deb9u1.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.27-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.
