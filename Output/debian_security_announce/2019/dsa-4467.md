---------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Jun 2019
Affected Packages:

[vim](https://packages.debian.org/src:vim)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-12735](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12735).  

More information:

User Arminius discovered a vulnerability in Vim, an enhanced version of the
standard UNIX editor Vi (Vi IMproved). The Common vulnerabilities and
exposures project identifies the following problem:


Editors typically provide a way to embed editor configuration commands (aka
modelines) which are executed once a file is opened, while harmful commands
are filtered by a sandbox mechanism. It was discovered that the source
command (used to include and execute another file) was not filtered, allowing
shell command execution with a carefully crafted file opened in Vim.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:8.0.0197-4+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.
