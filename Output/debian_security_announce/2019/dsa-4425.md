More information:

Kusano Kazuhiko discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
handling of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI) in wget, a
network utility to retrieve files from the web, which could result in
the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service when recursively
downloading from an untrusted server.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.18-5+deb9u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your wget packages.
