More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTP server.


* [CVE-2018-17189](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-17189)
Gal Goldshtein of F5 Networks discovered a denial of service
 vulnerability in mod\_http2. By sending malformed requests, the
 http/2 stream for that request unnecessarily occupied a server
 thread cleaning up incoming data, resulting in denial of service.
* [CVE-2018-17199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-17199)
Diego Angulo from ImExHS discovered that mod\_session\_cookie does not
 respect expiry time.
* [CVE-2019-0196](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0196)
Craig Young discovered that the http/2 request handling in mod\_http2
 could be made to access freed memory in string comparison when
 determining the method of a request and thus process the request
 incorrectly.
* [CVE-2019-0211](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0211)
Charles Fol discovered a privilege escalation from the
 less-privileged child process to the parent process running as root.
* [CVE-2019-0217](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0217)
A race condition in mod\_auth\_digest when running in a threaded
 server could allow a user with valid credentials to authenticate
 using another username, bypassing configured access control
 restrictions. The issue was discovered by Simon Kappel.
* [CVE-2019-0220](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0220)
Bernhard Lorenz of Alpha Strike Labs GmbH reported that URL
 normalizations were inconsistently handled. When the path component
 of a request URL contains multiple consecutive slashes ('/'),
 directives such as LocationMatch and RewriteRule must account for
 duplicates in regular expressions while other aspects of the servers
 processing will implicitly collapse them.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.25-3+deb9u7.


This update also contains bug fixes that were scheduled for inclusion in the
next stable point release. This includes a fix for a regression caused by a
security fix in version 2.4.25-3+deb9u6.


We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
