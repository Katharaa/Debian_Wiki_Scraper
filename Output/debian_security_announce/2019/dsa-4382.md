========================


DSA-4382-1 rssh -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
02 Feb 2019
Affected Packages:

[rssh](https://packages.debian.org/src:rssh)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-3463](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3463), [CVE-2019-3464](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3464).  

More information:

Nick Cleaton discovered two vulnerabilities in rssh, a restricted shell
that allows users to perform only scp, sftp, cvs, svnserve (Subversion),
rdist and/or rsync operations. Missing validation in the rsync support
could result in the bypass of this restriction, allowing the execution
of arbitrary shell commands.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3.4-5+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your rssh packages.
