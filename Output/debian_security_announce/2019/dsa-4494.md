DSA-4494-1 kconfig -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
09 Aug 2019
Affected Packages:

[kconfig](https://packages.debian.org/src:kconfig)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-14744](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14744).  

More information:

Dominik Penner discovered that KConfig, the KDE configuration settings
framework, supported a feature to define shell command execution in
.desktop files. If a user is provided with a malformed .desktop file
(e.g. if it's embedded into a downloaded archive and it gets opened in
a file browser) arbitrary commands could get executed. This update
removes this feature.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.28.0-2+deb9u1.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.54.0-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your kconfig packages.
