Affected Packages:

[pango1.0](https://packages.debian.org/src:pango1.0)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 933860](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=933860).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2019-1010238](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1010238).  

More information:

Benno Fuenfstueck discovered that Pango, a library for layout and
rendering of text with an emphasis on internationalization, is prone to a
heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the pango\_log2vis\_get\_embedding\_levels
function. An attacker can take advantage of this flaw for denial of
service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.42.4-7~deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your pango1.0 packages.
