Fang-Pen Lin discovered a stack-based buffer-overflow flaw in ZeroMQ, a
lightweight messaging kernel library. A remote, unauthenticated client

socket listening with CURVE encryption/authentication enabled, can take
advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or the execution of
arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.2.1-4+deb9u2.
