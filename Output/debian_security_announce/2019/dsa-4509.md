More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.


* [CVE-2019-9517](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9517)
Jonathan Looney reported that a malicious client could perform a
 denial of service attack (exhausting h2 workers) by flooding a
 connection with requests and basically never reading responses on
 the TCP connection.
* [CVE-2019-10081](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10081)
Craig Young reported that HTTP/2 PUSHes could lead to an overwrite
 of memory in the pushing request's pool, leading to crashes.
* [CVE-2019-10082](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10082)
Craig Young reported that the HTTP/2 session handling could be made
 to read memory after being freed, during connection shutdown.
* [CVE-2019-10092](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10092)
Matei Mal Badanoiu reported a limited cross-site scripting
 vulnerability in the mod\_proxy error page.
* [CVE-2019-10097](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10097)
Daniel McCarney reported that when mod\_remoteip was configured to
 use a trusted intermediary proxy server using the PROXY protocol,
 a specially crafted PROXY header could trigger a stack buffer
 overflow or NULL pointer deference. This vulnerability could only be
 triggered by a trusted proxy and not by untrusted HTTP clients. The
 issue does not affect the stretch release.
* [CVE-2019-10098](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10098)
Yukitsugu Sasaki reported a potential open redirect vulnerability in
 the mod\_rewrite module.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.4.25-3+deb9u8.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.38-3+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
