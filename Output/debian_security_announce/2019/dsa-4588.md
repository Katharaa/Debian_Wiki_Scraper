More information:

It was discovered that python-ecdsa, a cryptographic signature library
for Python, incorrectly handled certain signatures. A remote attacker
could use this issue to cause python-ecdsa to either not warn about
incorrect signatures, or generate exceptions resulting in a
denial-of-service.


For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.13-2+deb9u1.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.13-3+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your python-ecdsa packages.
