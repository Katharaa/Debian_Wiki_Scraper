Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Iceape internet suite,
an unbranded version of Seamonkey:


* [CVE-2011-2372](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2372)
Mariusz Mlynski discovered that websites could open a download

* [CVE-2011-2995](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2995)
Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary and Jesse Ruderman discovered crashes
 in the rendering engine, which could lead to the execution of
 arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2011-2998](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2998)
Mark Kaplan discovered an integer underflow in the JavaScript
 engine, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2011-2999](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2999)
Boris Zbarsky discovered that incorrect handling of the
 window.location object could lead to bypasses of the same-origin

Ian Graham discovered that multiple Location headers might lead to
 CRLF injection.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape package
only provides the XPCOM code.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-8. This update also marks the compromised DigiNotar
root certs as revoked rather then untrusted.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14-8.


We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.
