DSA-2234-1 zodb -- several vulnerabilities
------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 May 2011
Affected Packages:

[zodb](https://packages.debian.org/src:zodb)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 540465](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=540465).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2009-0668](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0668), [CVE-2009-0669](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0669).  

More information:

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in python-zodb, a set of
tools for using ZODB, that could lead to arbitrary code execution in the worst
case. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:


* [CVE-2009-0668](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0668)
The ZEO server doesn't restrict the callables when unpickling data
 received from a malicious client which can be used by an attacker to execute
 arbitrary Python code on the server by sending certain exception pickles. This
 also allows an attacker to import any importable module as ZEO is importing the
 module containing a callable specified in a pickle to test for a certain flag.
* [CVE-2009-0669](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0669)
Due to a programming error, an authorization method in the StorageServer
 component of ZEO was not used as an internal method. This allows a malicious
 client to bypass authentication when connecting to a ZEO server by simply
 calling this authorization method.


The update also limits the number of new object ids a client can request
to 100 as it would be possible to consume huge amounts of resources by
requesting a big batch of new object ids. No CVE id has been assigned to this.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.6.0-2+lenny3.


The stable distribution (squeeze) is not affected, it was fixed before
the initial release.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.8.2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your zodb packages.
