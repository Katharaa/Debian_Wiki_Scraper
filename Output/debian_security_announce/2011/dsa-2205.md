Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2205-1 gdm3 -- privilege escalation
---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
28 Mar 2011
Affected Packages:

[gdm3](https://packages.debian.org/src:gdm3)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-0727](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0727).  

More information:

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that GDM 3, the GNOME Display Manager,
does not properly drop privileges when manipulating files related to
the logged-in user. As a result, local users can gain root
privileges.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain a gdm3 package.
The gdm package is not affected by this issue.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.30.5-6squeeze2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your gdm3 packages.
