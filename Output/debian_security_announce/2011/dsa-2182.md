Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2182-1 logwatch -- shell command injection
----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
04 Mar 2011
Affected Packages:

[logwatch](https://packages.debian.org/src:logwatch)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 615995](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=615995).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-1018](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1018).  

More information:

Dominik George discovered that Logwatch does not guard against shell
meta-characters in crafted log file names (such as those produced by
Samba). As a result, an attacker might be able to execute shell
commands on the system running Logwatch.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.3.6.cvs20080702-2lenny1.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.3.6.cvs20090906-1squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 7.3.6.cvs20090906-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your logwatch packages.
