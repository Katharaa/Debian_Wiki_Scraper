DSA-2178-1 pango1.0 -- NULL pointer dereference
-----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
02 Mar 2011
Affected Packages:

[pango1.0](https://packages.debian.org/src:pango1.0)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-0064](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0064).  

More information:

It was discovered that Pango did not check for memory allocation
failures, causing a NULL pointer dereference with an adjustable
offset. This can lead to application crashes and potentially
arbitrary code execution.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.28.3-1+squeeze2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your pango1.0 packages.
