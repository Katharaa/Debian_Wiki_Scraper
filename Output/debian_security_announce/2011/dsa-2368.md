-----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[lighttpd](https://packages.debian.org/src:lighttpd)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 652726](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=652726).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-4362](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4362), [CVE-2011-3389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3389).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd, a small and fast
webserver with minimal memory footprint.


* [CVE-2011-4362](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4362)
Xi Wang discovered that the base64 decoding routine which is used to
 decode user input during an HTTP authentication, suffers of a signedness
 issue when processing user input. As a result it is possible to force
 lighttpd to perform an out-of-bounds read which results in Denial of
 Service conditions.
* [CVE-2011-3389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3389)
When using CBC ciphers on an SSL enabled virtual host to communicate with
 certain client, a so called BEAST attack allows man-in-the-middle
 attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP traffic via a blockwise
 chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session. Technically this is
 no lighttpd vulnerability. However, lighttpd offers a workaround to
 mitigate this problem by providing a possibility to disable CBC ciphers.


This updates includes this option by default. System administrators
 are advised to read the NEWS file of this update (as this may break older
 clients).


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.19-5+lenny3.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.28-2+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.30-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.
