More information:

Ansgar Burchardt, Mike O'Connor and Philipp Kern discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in DTC, a web control panel for admin and accounting
hosting services:


* [CVE-2011-3195](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3195)
A possible shell insertion has been found in the mailing list
 handling.
* [CVE-2011-3196](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3196)
Unix rights for the apache2.conf were set incorrectly (world
 readable).
* [CVE-2011-3197](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3197)
Incorrect input sanitising for the $\_SERVER["addrlink"] parameter
 could lead to SQL insertion.
* [CVE-2011-3198](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3198)
DTC was using the -b option of htpasswd, possibly revealing
 password in clear text using ps or reading /proc.
* [CVE-2011-3199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3199)
A possible HTML/JavaScript insertion vulnerability has been found
 in the DNS & MX section of the user panel.


This update also fixes several vulnerabilities, for which no CVE ID
has been assigned:


It has been discovered that DTC performs insufficient input sanitising
in the package installer, leading to possible unwanted destination
directory for installed packages if some DTC application packages
are installed (note that these aren't available in Debian main).


DTC was setting-up /etc/sudoers with permissive sudo rights to
chrootuid.


Incorrect input sanitizing in the package installer could lead to
SQL insertion.


A malicious user could enter a specially crafted support ticket
subject leading to an SQL injection in the draw\_user\_admin.php.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.29.18-1+lenny2.


The stable distribution (squeeze) doesn't include dtc.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.34.1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your dtc packages.
