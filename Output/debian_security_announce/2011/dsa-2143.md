More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL database server.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:


* [CVE-2010-3677](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3677)
It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
 a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) via a join query that uses a
 table with a unique SET column.
* [CVE-2010-3680](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3680)
It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
 a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) by creating temporary tables
 while using InnoDB, which triggers an assertion failure.
* [CVE-2010-3681](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3681)
It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
 a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) by using the HANDLER interface
 and performing "alternate reads from two indexes on a table," which
 triggers an assertion failure.
* [CVE-2010-3682](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3682)
It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled use of EXPLAIN with
 certain queries.
 An authenticated user could crash the server.
* [CVE-2010-3833](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3833)
It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled propagation during
 evaluation of arguments to extreme-value functions.
 An authenticated user could crash the server.
* [CVE-2010-3834](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3834)
It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled materializing a derived
 table that required a temporary table for grouping.
 An authenticated user could crash the server.
* [CVE-2010-3835](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3835)
It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled certain user-variable
 assignment expressions that are evaluated in a logical expression context.
 An authenticated user could crash the server.
* [CVE-2010-3836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3836)
It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled pre-evaluation of LIKE
 predicates during view preparation.
 An authenticated user could crash the server.
* [CVE-2010-3837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3837)
It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled using GROUP\_CONCAT()
 and WITH ROLLUP together.
 An authenticated user could crash the server.
* [CVE-2010-3838](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3838)
It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled certain queries using a
 mixed list of numeric and LONGBLOB arguments to the GREATEST() or
 LEAST() functions.
 An authenticated user could crash the server.
* [CVE-2010-3840](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3840)
It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled improper WKB data
 passed to the PolyFromWKB() function.
 An authenticated user could crash the server.


For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.0.51a-24+lenny5.


The testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution do not contain
mysql-dfsg-5.0 anymore.


We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.
