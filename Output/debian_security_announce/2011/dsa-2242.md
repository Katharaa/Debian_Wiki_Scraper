Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 627081](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=627081).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-1926](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1926).  

More information:

It was discovered that the STARTTLS implementation of the Cyrus IMAP
server does not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted IMAP,
LMTP, NNTP and POP3 sessions by sending a cleartext command that is
processed after TLS is in place.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-14+lenny4.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-19+squeeze1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13p1-11 for cyrus-imapd-2.2 and in version 2.4.7-1
for cyrus-imapd-2.4.


We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 packages.
