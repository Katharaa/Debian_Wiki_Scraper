Several vulnerabilities were discovered in ProFTPD, an FTP server:


* (No CVE id)
 ProFTPD incorrectly uses data from an unencrypted input buffer
 after encryption has been enabled with STARTTLS, an issue
 similar to
 [CVE-2011-0411](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0411).
* [CVE-2011-4130](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4130)
ProFTPD uses a response pool after freeing it under
 exceptional conditions, possibly leading to remote code
 execution. (The version in lenny is not affected by this
 problem.)


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1-17lenny9.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.3a-6squeeze4.

(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.3.4~rc3-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your proftpd-dfsg packages.
