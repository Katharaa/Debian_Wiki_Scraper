More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leak. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2009-4067](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4067)
Rafael Dominguez Vega of MWR InfoSecurity reported an issue in the auerswald
 module, a driver for Auerswald PBX/System Telephone USB devices. Attackers
 with physical access to a system's USB ports could obtain elevated
 privileges using a specially crafted USB device.
* [CVE-2011-0712](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0712)
Rafael Dominguez Vega of MWR InfoSecurity reported an issue in the caiaq
 module, a USB driver for Native Instruments USB audio devices. Attackers
 with physical access to a system's USB ports could obtain elevated
 privileges using a specially crafted USB device.
* [CVE-2011-1020](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1020)
Kees Cook discovered an issue in the /proc filesystem that allows local
 users to gain access to sensitive process information after execution of a
 setuid binary.
* [CVE-2011-2209](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2209)
Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the osf\_sysinfo() system call on the
 alpha architecture. Local users could obtain access to sensitive kernel
 memory.
* [CVE-2011-2211](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2211)
Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the osf\_wait4() system call on the
 alpha architecture permitting local users to gain elevated privileges.
* [CVE-2011-2213](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2213)
Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the INET socket monitoring interface.
 Local users could cause a denial of service by injecting code and causing
 the kernel to execute an infinite loop.
* [CVE-2011-2484](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2484)
Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that the number of exit handlers that
 a process can register is not capped, resulting in local denial of service
 through resource exhaustion (CPU time and memory).
* [CVE-2011-2491](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2491)
Vasily Averin discovered an issue with the NFS locking implementation. A
 malicious NFS server can cause a client to hang indefinitely in an unlock
 call.
* [CVE-2011-2492](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2492)
Marek Kroemeke and Filip Palian discovered that uninitialized struct
 elements in the Bluetooth subsystem could lead to a leak of sensitive kernel
 memory through leaked stack memory.
* [CVE-2011-2495](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2495)
Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that the io file of a process' proc
 directory was world-readable, resulting in local information disclosure of
 information such as password lengths.
* [CVE-2011-2496](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2496)
Robert Swiecki discovered that mremap() could be abused for local denial of
 service by triggering a BUG\_ON assert.
* [CVE-2011-2497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2497)
Dan Rosenberg discovered an integer underflow in the Bluetooth subsystem,
 which could lead to denial of service or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2011-2525](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2525)
Ben Pfaff reported an issue in the network scheduling code. A local user
 could cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by sending a
 specially crafted netlink message.
* [CVE-2011-2928](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2928)
Timo Warns discovered that insufficient validation of Be filesystem images
 could lead to local denial of service if a malformed filesystem image is
 mounted.
* [CVE-2011-3188](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3188)
Dan Kaminsky reported a weakness of the sequence number generation in the
 TCP protocol implementation. This can be used by remote attackers to inject
 packets into an active session.
* [CVE-2011-3191](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3191)
Darren Lavender reported an issue in the Common Internet File System (CIFS).
 A malicious file server could cause memory corruption leading to a denial of
 service.


This update also includes a fix for a regression introduced with the previous
security fix for [CVE-2011-1768](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1768)
([Debian bug #633738](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=633738)).



For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.26-26lenny4. Updates for arm and alpha are not yet available, but will be
released as soon as possible. Updates for the hppa and ia64 architectures will
be included in the upcoming 5.0.9 point release.


The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:




|  | Debian 5.0 (lenny) |
| --- | --- |
| user-mode-linux | 2.6.26-1um-2+26lenny4 |


We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
These updates will not become active until after your system is rebooted.


Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.
