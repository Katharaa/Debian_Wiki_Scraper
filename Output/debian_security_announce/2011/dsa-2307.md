More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Chromium browser.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:


* [CVE-2011-2818](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2818)
Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via
 vectors related to display box rendering.

* [CVE-2011-2800](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2800)
Google Chrome allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive
 information about client-side redirect targets via a crafted web site.
* [CVE-2011-2359](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2359)
Google Chrome does not properly track line boxes during rendering, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a stale pointer.


Several unauthorised SSL certificates have been found in the wild issued
for the DigiNotar Certificate Authority, obtained through a security
compromise with said company.
This update blacklists SSL certificates issued by DigiNotar-controlled
intermediate CAs used by the Dutch PKIoverheid program.
