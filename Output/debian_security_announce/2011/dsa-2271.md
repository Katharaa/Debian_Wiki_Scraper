DSA-2271-1 curl -- improper delegation of client credentials
------------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
02 Jul 2011
Affected Packages:

[curl](https://packages.debian.org/src:curl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-2192](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2192).  

More information:

Richard Silverman discovered that when doing GSSAPI authentication, libcurl
unconditionally performs credential delegation. This hands the server a copy of
the client's security credentials, allowing the server to impersonate the
client to any other using the same GSSAPI mechanism.
This is obviously a very sensitive operation, which should only be done when
the user explicitly so directs.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.18.2-8lenny5.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.21.6-2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.21.6-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
