More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Chromium browser.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


* [CVE-2011-0779](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0779)
Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 does not properly handle a missing key in an
 extension, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) via a crafted extension.
* [CVE-2011-1290](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1290)
Integer overflow in WebKit allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
 via unknown vectors, as demonstrated by Vincenzo Iozzo, Willem Pinckaers, and
 Ralf-Philipp Weinmann during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2011.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 6.0.472.63~r59945-5+squeeze4.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.648.133~r77742-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your chromium-browser packages.
