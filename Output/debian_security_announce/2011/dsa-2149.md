========================


DSA-2149-1 dbus -- denial of service
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
20 Jan 2011
Affected Packages:

[dbus](https://packages.debian.org/src:dbus)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2010-4352](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4352).  

More information:

RÃ©mi Denis-Courmont discovered that dbus, a message bus application,
is not properly limiting the nesting level when examining messages with
extensive nested variants. This allows an attacker to crash the dbus system
daemon due to a call stack overflow via crafted messages.


For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-5+lenny2.


For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.24-4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.24-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.
