DSA-2193-1 libcgroup -- several vulnerabilities
-----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
16 Mar 2011
Affected Packages:

[libcgroup](https://packages.debian.org/src:libcgroup)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 615987](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=615987).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-1006](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1006), [CVE-2011-1022](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1022).  

More information:

Several issues have been discovered in libcgroup, a library to control
and monitor control groups:


* [CVE-2011-1006](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1006)
Heap-based buffer overflow by converting list of controllers for
 given task into an array of strings could lead to privilege
 escalation by a local attacker.
* [CVE-2011-1022](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1022)
libcgroup did not properly check the origin of Netlink messages,
 allowing a local attacker to send crafted Netlink messages which
 could lead to privilege escalation.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain libcgroup packages.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.36.2-3+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your libcgroup packages.
