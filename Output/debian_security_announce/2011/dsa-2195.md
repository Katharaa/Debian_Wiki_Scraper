------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
19 Mar 2011
Affected Packages:

[php5](https://packages.debian.org/src:php5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-0441](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0441), [CVE-2010-3709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3709), [CVE-2010-3710](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3710), [CVE-2010-3870](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3870), [CVE-2010-4150](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4150).  

More information:

Stephane Chazelas discovered that the cronjob of the PHP 5 package in
Debian suffers from a race condition which might be used to remove
arbitrary files from a system ([CVE-2011-0441](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0441)).


When upgrading your php5-common package take special care to **accept**
the changes to the /etc/cron.d/php5 file. Ignoring them would leave the
system vulnerable.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny10.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.6-1.


Additionally, the following vulnerabilities have also been fixed in the
oldstable distribution (lenny):


* [CVE-2010-3709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3709)
Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the ZipArchive class
 may dereference a NULL pointer when extracting comments from a ZIP
 archive, leading to application crash and possible denial of
 service.
* [CVE-2010-3710](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3710)
Stefan Neufeind discovered that the FILTER\_VALIDATE\_EMAIL filter
 does not correctly handle long, to be validated, strings. Such
 crafted strings may lead to denial of service because of high memory
 consumption and application crash.
* [CVE-2010-3870](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3870)
It was discovered that PHP does not correctly handle certain UTF-8
 sequences and may be used to bypass XSS protections.
* [CVE-2010-4150](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4150)
Mateusz Kocielski discovered that the IMAP extension may try to
 free already freed memory when processing user credentials, leading
 to application crash and possibly arbitrary code execution.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
