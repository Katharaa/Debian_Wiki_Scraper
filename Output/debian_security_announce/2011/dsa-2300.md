Date Reported:
05 Sep 2011
Affected Packages:

[nss](https://packages.debian.org/src:nss)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
No other external database security references currently available.
More information:

Several unauthorised SSL certificates have been found in the wild issued
for the DigiNotar Certificate Authority, obtained through a security
compromise with said company. Debian, like other software
distributors, has as a precaution decided to disable the DigiNotar
Root CA by default in the NSS crypto libraries.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.3.1-0lenny6.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.8-1+squeeze3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.11-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.
