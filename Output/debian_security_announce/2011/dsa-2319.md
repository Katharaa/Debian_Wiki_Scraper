More information:

Neel Mehta discovered that a race condition in Policykit, a framework
for managing administrative policies and privileges, allowed local
users to elevate privileges by executing a setuid program from pkexec.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain the policykit-1
package.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.96-4+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 0.101-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your policykit-1 packages.
