Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Ruby on Rails, a web

project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2009-3086](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3086)

 The cookie store may be vulnerable to a timing attack,
 potentially allowing remote attackers to forge message
 digests.

 A cross-site scripting vulnerability in the strip\_tags
 function allows remote user-assisted attackers to inject
 arbitrary web script.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.1.0-7+lenny0.2.


For the other distributions, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.3-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.
