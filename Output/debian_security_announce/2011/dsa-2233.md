---------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 May 2011
Affected Packages:

[postfix](https://packages.debian.org/src:postfix)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2009-2939](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2939), [CVE-2011-0411](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0411), [CVE-2011-1720](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1720).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Postfix, a mail transfer
agent. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:


* [CVE-2009-2939](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2939)
The postinst script grants the postfix user write access to
 /var/spool/postfix/pid, which might allow local users to
 conduct symlink attacks that overwrite arbitrary files.
* [CVE-2011-0411](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0411)
The STARTTLS implementation does not properly restrict I/O
 buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert
 commands into encrypted SMTP sessions by sending a cleartext
 command that is processed after TLS is in place.
* [CVE-2011-1720](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1720)
A heap-based read-only buffer overflow allows malicious
 clients to crash the smtpd server process using a crafted SASL
 authentication request.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.5-1.1+lenny1.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.1-1+squeeze1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.0-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your postfix packages.
