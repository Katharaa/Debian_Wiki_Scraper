In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-2930](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2930), [CVE-2011-2931](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2931), [CVE-2011-3186](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3186), [CVE-2009-4214](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4214).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, the Ruby web
application framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2009-4214](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4214)
A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the
 strip\_tags function. An attacker may inject non-printable characters
 that certain browsers will then evaluate. This vulnerability only
 affects the oldstable distribution (lenny).
* [CVE-2011-2930](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2930)
A SQL injection vulnerability had been found in the quote\_table\_name
 method that could allow malicious users to inject arbitrary SQL into a
 query.
* [CVE-2011-2931](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2931)
A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the
 strip\_tags helper. An parsing error can be exploited by an attacker,
 who can confuse the parser and may inject HTML tags into the output
 document.
* [CVE-2011-3186](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3186)
A newline (CRLF) injection vulnerability had been found in
 response.rb. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary
 HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via the
 Content-Type header.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-7+lenny2.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.14.


We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.
