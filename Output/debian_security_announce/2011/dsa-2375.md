It was discovered that the encryption support for BSD telnetd contains
a pre-authentication buffer overflow, which may enable remote
attackers who can connect to the Telnet port to execute arbitrary code
with root privileges.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.dfsg.4~beta1-5lenny7 of the krb5 package.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.0.1-1.2 of the krb5-appl package.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 and krb5-appl packages.
