More information:

Witold Baryluk discovered that MaraDNS, a simple security-focused
Domain Name System server, may overflow an internal buffer when
handling requests with a large number of labels, causing a server
crash and the consequent denial of service.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.07.09-2.1.


For the stable distribution (squeeze) and greater this problem had
already been fixed in version 1.4.03-1.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your maradns packages.
