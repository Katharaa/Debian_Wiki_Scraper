------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
06 Oct 2011
Affected Packages:

[cyrus-imapd-2.2](https://packages.debian.org/src:cyrus-imapd-2.2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-3372](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3372), [CVE-2011-3208](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3208).  

More information:

Multiple security issues have been discovered in cyrus-imapd, a highly scalable
mail system designed for use in enterprise environments. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2011-3208](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3208)
Coverity discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the NNTP server
 implementation (nttpd) of cyrus-imapd. An attacker can exploit this
 flaw via several crafted NNTP commands to execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2011-3372](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3372)
Stefan Cornelius of Secunia Research discovered that the command processing
 of the NNTP server implementation (nttpd) of cyrus-imapd is not properly
 implementing access restrictions for certain commands and is not checking
 for a complete, successful authentication. An attacker can use this flaw
 to bypass access restrictions for some commands and, e.g. exploit
 [CVE-2011-3208](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3208) without proper authentication.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2\_2.2.13-14+lenny5.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2\_2.2.13-19+squeeze2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
cyrus-imapd-2.4 version 2.4.12-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 packages.
