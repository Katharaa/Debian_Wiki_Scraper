-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
05 Jul 2011
Affected Packages:

[bind9](https://packages.debian.org/src:bind9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-2464](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2464).  

More information:

It was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, does not correctly process
certain UPDATE requests, resulting in a server crash and a denial of
service. This vulnerability affects BIND installations even if they
do not actually use dynamic DNS updates.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.6.ESV.R4+dfsg-0+lenny3.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze3.


The testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid)
will be fixed later.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
