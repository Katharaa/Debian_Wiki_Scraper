More information:

Ansgar Burchardt discovered several vulnerabilities in DTC, a web
control panel for admin and accounting hosting services.


* [CVE-2011-0434](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0434)
The bw\_per\_moth.php graph contains an SQL injection vulnerability.
* [CVE-2011-0435](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0435)
Insufficient checks in bw\_per\_month.php can lead to bandwidth
 usage information disclosure.
* [CVE-2011-0436](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0436)
After a registration, passwords are sent in cleartext
 email messages.
* [CVE-2011-0437](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0437)
Authenticated users could delete accounts using an obsolete
 interface which was incorrectly included in the package.


This update introduces a new configuration option which controls the
presence of cleartext passwords in email messages. The default is not
to include cleartext passwords.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.29.17-1+lenny1.


The stable distribution (squeeze) and the testing distribution
(wheezy) do not contain any dtc packages.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.32.10-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your dtc packages.
