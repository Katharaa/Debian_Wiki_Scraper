More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Request Tracker, an issue tracking
system.


* [CVE-2011-1685](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1685)
If the external custom field feature is enabled, Request Tracker
 allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary code with the
 permissions of the web server, possible triggered by a cross-site
 request forgery attack. (External custom fields are disabled by
 default.)
* [CVE-2011-1686](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1686)
Multiple SQL injection attacks allow authenticated users to obtain
 data from the database in an unauthorized way.
* [CVE-2011-1687](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1687)
An information leak allows an authenticated privileged user to
 obtain sensitive information, such as encrypted passwords, via the
 search interface.
* [CVE-2011-1688](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1688)
When running under certain web servers (such as Lighttpd), Request
 Tracker is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing
 attackers to read any files accessible to the web server. Request
 Tracker instances running under Apache or Nginx are not affected.
* [CVE-2011-1689](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1689)
Request Tracker contains multiple cross-site scripting
 vulnerabilities.
* [CVE-2011-1690](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1690)
Request Tracker enables attackers to redirect authentication
 credentials supplied by legitimate users to third-party servers.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.6.7-5+lenny6 of the request-tracker3.6 package.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.8.8-7+squeeze1 of the request-tracker3.8 package.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 3.8.10-1 of the
request-tracker3.8 package.


We recommend that you upgrade your Request Tracker packages.
