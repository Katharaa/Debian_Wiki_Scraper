More information:

It was discovered that Perl's Safe module - a module to compile and
execute code in restricted compartments - could be bypassed.


Please note that this update is known to break Petal, an XML-based
templating engine (shipped with Debian 6.0/Squeeze in the package
libpetal-perl, see
[bug #582805](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=582805) for details). A fix is not yet available. If you use Petal, you
might consider to put the previous Perl packages on hold.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.10.0-19lenny5.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.10.1-17squeeze2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.12.3-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.
