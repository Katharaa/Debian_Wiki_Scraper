--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-3323](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3323), [CVE-2011-3324](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3324), [CVE-2011-3325](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3325), [CVE-2011-3326](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3326), [CVE-2011-3327](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3327).  

More information:

Riku Hietamaki, Tuomo Untinen and Jukka Taimisto discovered several
vulnerabilities in Quagga, an Internet routing daemon:


* [CVE-2011-3323](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3323)
A stack-based buffer overflow while decoding Link State Update
 packets with a malformed Inter Area Prefix LSA can cause the
 ospf6d process to crash or (potentially) execute arbitrary
 code.
* [CVE-2011-3324](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3324)
The ospf6d process can crash while processing a Database
 Description packet with a crafted Link-State-Advertisement.
* [CVE-2011-3325](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3325)
The ospfd process can crash while processing a crafted Hello
 packet.
* [CVE-2011-3326](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3326)
The ospfd process crashes while processing
 Link-State-Advertisements of a type not known to Quagga.
* [CVE-2011-3327](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3327)
A heap-based buffer overflow while processing BGP UPDATE
 messages containing an Extended Communities path attribute
 can cause the bgpd process to crash or (potentially) execute
 arbitrary code.


The OSPF-related vulnerabilities require that potential attackers send
packets to a vulnerable Quagga router; the packets are not distributed
over OSPF. In contrast, the BGP UPDATE messages could be propagated
by some routers.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.10-1lenny6.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.17-2+squeeze3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.99.19-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.
