More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Chromium browser.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


* [CVE-2011-0777](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0777)
Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via vectors related to image loading.
* [CVE-2011-0778](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0778)
Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 does not properly restrict drag and drop
 operations, which might allow remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin
 Policy via unspecified vectors.
* [CVE-2011-0783](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0783)
Unspecified vulnerability in Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 allows
 user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) via vectors involving a bad volume setting.
* [CVE-2011-0983](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0983)
Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly handle anonymous blocks,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a stale pointer.
* [CVE-2011-0981](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0981)
Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly perform event handling for
 animations, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a
 stale pointer.
* [CVE-2011-0984](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0984)
Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly handle plug-ins, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read)
 via unspecified vectors.
* [CVE-2011-0985](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0985)
Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly perform process termination
 upon memory exhaustion, which has unspecified impact and remote attack vectors.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 6.0.472.63~r59945-5+squeeze2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed
