More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, the Ruby web
application framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2011-0446](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0446)
Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities when JavaScript
 encoding is used, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
 script or HTML.
* [CVE-2011-0447](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0447)
Rails does not properly validate HTTP requests that contain an
 X-Requested-With header, which makes it easier for remote attackers
 to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-7+lenny0.1.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze0.1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.11-0.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.
