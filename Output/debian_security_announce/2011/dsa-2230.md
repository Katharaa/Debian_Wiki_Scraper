More information:

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in KVM, a solution for full
virtualization on x86 hardware:


* [CVE-2011-0011](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0011)
Setting the VNC password to an empty string silently disabled
 all authentication.
* [CVE-2011-1750](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1750)
The virtio-blk driver performed insufficient validation of
 read/write I/O from the guest instance, which could lead to
 denial of service or privilege escalation.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5+dfsg-5+squeeze1.


The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
