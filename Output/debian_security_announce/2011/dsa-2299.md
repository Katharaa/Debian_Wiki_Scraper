Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2299-1 ca-certificates -- compromised certificate authority
---------------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
31 Aug 2011
Affected Packages:

[ca-certificates](https://packages.debian.org/src:ca-certificates)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 639744](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=639744).  

More information:

An unauthorized SSL certificate has been found in the wild issued
for the DigiNotar Certificate Authority, obtained through a security
compromise with said company. Debian, like other software
distributors, has as a precaution decided to disable the DigiNotar
Root CA by default in its ca-certificates bundle.


For other software in Debian that ships a CA bundle, like the
Mozilla suite, updates are forthcoming.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), the ca-certificates package
does not contain this root CA.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), the root CA has been
disabled starting ca-certificates version 20090814+nmu3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution
(sid), the root CA has been disabled starting ca-certificates
version 20110502+nmu1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ca-certificates packages.
