Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2169-1 telepathy-gabble -- insufficient input validation
------------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
16 Feb 2011
Affected Packages:

[telepathy-gabble](https://packages.debian.org/src:telepathy-gabble)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
No other external database security references currently available.
More information:

It was discovered that telepathy-gabble, the Jabber/XMPP connection manager
for the Telepathy framework, is processing google:jingleinfo updates without
validating their origin. This may allow an attacker to trick telepathy-gabble
into relaying streamed media data through a server of his choice and thus
intercept audio and video calls.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.6-1+lenny1.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.15-1+squeeze1.


For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your telepathy-gabble packages.
