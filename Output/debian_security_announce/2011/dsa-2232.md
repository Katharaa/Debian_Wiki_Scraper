Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 624670](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624670).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-1764](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1764).  

More information:

It was discovered that Exim, the default mail transport agent in
Debian, uses DKIM data obtain from DNS directly in a format string,
potentially allowing malicious mail senders to execute arbitrary code.
([CVE-2011-1764](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1764))


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem
because it does not contain DKIM support.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.72-6+squeeze1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.75-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your exim4 packages.
