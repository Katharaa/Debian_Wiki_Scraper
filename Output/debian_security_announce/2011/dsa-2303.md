More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2011-1020](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1020)
Kees Cook discovered an issue in the /proc filesystem that allows local
 users to gain access to sensitive process information after execution of a
 setuid binary.
* [CVE-2011-1576](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1576)
Ryan Sweat discovered an issue in the VLAN implementation. Local users may
 be able to cause a kernel memory leak, resulting in a denial of service.
* [CVE-2011-2484](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2484)
Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that the number of exit handlers that
 a process can register is not capped, resulting in local denial of service
 through resource exhaustion (CPU time and memory).
* [CVE-2011-2491](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2491)
Vasily Averin discovered an issue with the NFS locking implementation. A
 malicious NFS server can cause a client to hang indefinitely in an unlock
 call.
* [CVE-2011-2492](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2492)
Marek Kroemeke and Filip Palian discovered that uninitialized struct
 elements in the Bluetooth subsystem could lead to a leak of sensitive kernel
 memory through leaked stack memory.
* [CVE-2011-2495](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2495)
Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that the io file of a process' proc
 directory was world-readable, resulting in local information disclosure of
 information such as password lengths.
* [CVE-2011-2496](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2496)
Robert Swiecki discovered that mremap() could be abused for local denial of
 service by triggering a BUG\_ON assert.
* [CVE-2011-2497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2497)
Dan Rosenberg discovered an integer underflow in the Bluetooth subsystem,
 which could lead to denial of service or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2011-2517](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2517)
It was discovered that the netlink-based wireless configuration interface
 performed insufficient length validation when parsing SSIDs, resulting in
 buffer overflows. Local users with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability can cause a
 denial of service.
* [CVE-2011-2525](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2525)
Ben Pfaff reported an issue in the network scheduling code. A local user
 could cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by sending a
 specially crafted netlink message.
* [CVE-2011-2700](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2700)
Mauro Carvalho Chehab of Red Hat reported a buffer overflow issue in the
 driver for the Si4713 FM Radio Transmitter driver used by N900 devices.
 Local users could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or
 potentially gain elevated privileges.
* [CVE-2011-2723](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2723)
Brent Meshier reported an issue in the GRO (generic receive offload)
 implementation. This can be exploited by remote users to create a denial of
 service (system crash) in certain network device configurations.
* [CVE-2011-2905](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2905)
Christian Ohm discovered that the perf analysis tool searches for its
 config files in the current working directory. This could lead to denial of
 service or potential privilege escalation if a user with elevated privileges
 is tricked into running perf in a directory under the control of the
 attacker.
* [CVE-2011-2909](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2909)
Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that a programming error in
 the Comedi driver could lead to the information disclosure through
 leaked stack memory.
* [CVE-2011-2918](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2918)
Vince Weaver discovered that incorrect handling of software event overflows
 in the perf analysis tool could lead to local denial of service.
* [CVE-2011-2928](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2928)
Timo Warns discovered that insufficient validation of Be filesystem images
 could lead to local denial of service if a malformed filesystem image is
 mounted.
* [CVE-2011-3188](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3188)
Dan Kaminsky reported a weakness of the sequence number generation in the
 TCP protocol implementation. This can be used by remote attackers to inject
 packets into an active session.
* [CVE-2011-3191](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3191)
Darren Lavender reported an issue in the Common Internet File System (CIFS).
 A malicious file server could cause memory corruption leading to a denial of
 service.


This update also includes a fix for a regression introduced with the previous
security fix for [CVE-2011-1768](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1768)
([Debian bug #633738](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=633738)).



For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-35squeeze2. Updates for issues impacting the oldstable distribution
(lenny) will be available soon.


The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:




|  | Debian 6.0 (squeeze) |
| --- | --- |
| user-mode-linux | 2.6.32-1um-4+35squeeze2 |


We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
