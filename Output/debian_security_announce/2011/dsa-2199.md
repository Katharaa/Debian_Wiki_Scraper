Affected Packages:

[iceape](https://packages.debian.org/src:iceape)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
No other external database security references currently available.
More information:

This update for the Iceape internet suite, an unbranded version of
Seamonkey, updates the certificate blacklist for several fraudulent
HTTPS certificates.


More details can be found in a [blog posting by Jacob Appelbaum of the Tor project](https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/ssl-tls-ca-tor-certificates-torbrowser).



The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape package only
provides the XPCOM code.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.13-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.
