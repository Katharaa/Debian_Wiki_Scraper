========================


DSA-2330-1 simplesamlphp -- XML encryption weakness
---------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
27 Oct 2011
Affected Packages:

[simplesamlphp](https://packages.debian.org/src:simplesamlphp)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
No other external database security references currently available.
More information:

Issues were found in the handling of XML encryption in simpleSAMLphp,
an application for federated authentication. The following two issues
have been addressed:


It may be possible to use an SP as an oracle to decrypt encrypted
messages sent to that SP.


It may be possible to use the SP as a key oracle which can be used
to forge messages from that SP by issuing 300000-2000000 queries to
the SP. 


The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain simplesamlphp.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.3-2.


The testing distribution (wheezy) will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your simplesamlphp packages.
