========================


DSA-2214-1 ikiwiki -- missing input validation
----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
08 Apr 2011
Affected Packages:

[ikiwiki](https://packages.debian.org/src:ikiwiki)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-1401](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1401).  

More information:

Tango discovered that ikiwiki, a wiki compiler, is not validating
if the htmlscrubber plugin is enabled or not on a page when adding
alternative stylesheets to pages. This enables an attacker who is able
to upload custom stylesheets to add malicious stylesheets as an alternate
stylesheet, or replace the default stylesheet, and thus conduct
cross-site scripting attacks.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.53.6.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.20100815.7.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.20110328.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.20110328.


We recommend that you upgrade your ikiwiki packages.
