========================


DSA-2213-1 x11-xserver-utils -- missing input sanitization
----------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
08 Apr 2011
Affected Packages:

[x11-xserver-utils](https://packages.debian.org/src:x11-xserver-utils)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 621423](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=621423).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-0465](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0465).  

More information:

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that the xrdb utility of x11-xserver-utils,
a X server resource database utility, is not properly filtering crafted
hostnames. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with
root privileges given that either remote logins via xdmcp are allowed or
the attacker is able to place a rogue DHCP server into the victims network.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.3+6.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.5+3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.6+2.


We recommend that you upgrade your x11-xserver-utils packages.
