More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java SE platform. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2011-0862](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0862)
Integer overflow errors in the JPEG and font parser allow
 untrusted code (including applets) to elevate its privileges.
* [CVE-2011-0864](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0864)
Hotspot, the just-in-time compiler in OpenJDK, mishandled
 certain byte code instructions, allowing untrusted code
 (including applets) to crash the virtual machine.
* [CVE-2011-0865](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0865)
A race condition in signed object deserialization could
 allow untrusted code to modify signed content, apparently
 leaving its signature intact.
* [CVE-2011-0867](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0867)
Untrusted code (including applets) could access information
 about network interfaces which was not intended to be public.
 (Note that the interface MAC address is still available to
 untrusted code.)
* [CVE-2011-0868](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0868)
A float-to-long conversion could overflow, allowing
 untrusted code (including applets) to crash the virtual
 machine.
* [CVE-2011-0869](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0869)
Untrusted code (including applets) could intercept HTTP
 requests by reconfiguring proxy settings through a SOAP
 connection.
* [CVE-2011-0871](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0871)
Untrusted code (including applets) could elevate its
 privileges through the Swing MediaTracker code.


In addition, this update removes support for the Zero/Shark and Cacao
Hotspot variants from the i386 and amd64 due to stability issues.
These Hotspot variants are included in the openjdk-6-jre-zero and
icedtea-6-jre-cacao packages, and these packages must be removed
during this update.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems will be fixed
in a separate DSA for technical reasons.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 6b18-1.8.9-0.1~squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 6b18-1.8.9-0.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.
