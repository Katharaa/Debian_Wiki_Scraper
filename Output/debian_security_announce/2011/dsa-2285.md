 filters).
* [CVE-2011-2704](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2704)
Missing length checks in the processing of OGC filter encoding that can
 lead to stack-based buffer overflows and the execution of arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.3-3+lenny7.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.6.5-2+squeeze2.


For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distributions, these problems
will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your mapserver packages.
