DSA-2154-1 exim4 -- privilege escalation
----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 Jan 2011
Affected Packages:

[exim4](https://packages.debian.org/src:exim4)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2010-4345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4345), [CVE-2011-0017](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0017).  

More information:

A design flaw ([CVE-2010-4345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4345))
in exim4 allowed the local Debian-exim user to obtain root privileges by
specifying an alternate configuration file using the -C option or by using the
macro override facility (-D option). Unfortunately, fixing this vulnerability
is not possible without some changes in exim4's behaviour. If you use the -C
or -D options or use the system filter facility, you should evaluate
the changes carefully and adjust your configuration accordingly. The
Debian default configuration is not affected by the changes.


The detailed list of changes is described in the NEWS.Debian file in
the packages. The relevant sections are also reproduced below.


In addition to that, missing error handling for the setuid/setgid
system calls allowed the Debian-exim user to cause root to append log data to
arbitrary files ([CVE-2011-0017](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0017)).


For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.69-9+lenny3.


For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problem have been fixed in version 4.72-4.


Excerpt from the NEWS.Debian file from the packages exim4-daemon-light
and exim4-daemon-heavy:



> 
> ```
> 
> Exim versions up to and including 4.72 are vulnerable to
> CVE-2010-4345. This is a privilege escalation issue that allows the
> exim user to gain root privileges by specifying an alternate
> configuration file using the -C option. The macro override facility
> (-D) might also be misused for this purpose.
> 
> In reaction to this security vulnerability upstream has made a number
> of user visible changes. This package includes these changes.
> 
> If exim is invoked with the -C or -D option the daemon will not regain
> root privileges though re-execution. This is usually necessary for
> local delivery, though. Therefore it is generally not possible anymore
> to run an exim daemon with -D or -C options.
> 
> However this version of exim has been built with
> TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST=/etc/exim4/trusted_configs. TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST
> defines a list of configuration files which are trusted; if a config
> file is owned by root and matches a pathname in the list, then it may
> be invoked by the Exim build-time user without Exim relinquishing root
> privileges.
> 
> As a hotfix to not break existing installations of mailscanner we have
> also set WHITELIST_D_MACROS=OUTGOING. i.e. it is still possible to
> start exim with -DOUTGOING while being able to do local deliveries.
> 
> If you previously were using -D switches you will need to change your
> setup to use a separate configuration file. The ".include" mechanism
> makes this easy.
> 
> The system filter is run as exim_user instead of root by default.  If
> your setup requies root privileges when running the system filter you
> will need to set the system_filter_user exim main configuration
> option.
