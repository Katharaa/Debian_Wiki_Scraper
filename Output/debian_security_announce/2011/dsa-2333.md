Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 646754](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=646754).

More information:

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpLDAPadmin, a web based
interface for administering LDAP servers. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2011-4074](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4074)
Input appended to the URL in cmd.php (when cmd is set to \_debug) is
 not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be
 exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser
 session in context of an affected site.
* [CVE-2011-4075](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4075)
Input passed to the orderby parameter in cmd.php (when cmd is set to
 query\_engine, query is set to none, and search is set to e.g.
 1) is not properly sanitised in lib/functions.php before being used in a
 create\_function() function call. This can be exploited to inject and
 execute arbitrary PHP code.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.0.5-6+lenny2.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.0.5-2+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.0.5-2.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your phpldapadmin packages.
