Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2257-1 vlc -- heap-based buffer overflow
--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Jun 2011
Affected Packages:

[vlc](https://packages.debian.org/src:vlc)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-2194](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2194).  

More information:

Rocco Calvi discovered that the XSPF playlist parser of VLC, a multimedia
player and streamer, is prone to an integer overflow resulting in a
heap-based buffer overflow. This might allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening a specially crafted
file.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-1squeeze6.


For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.
