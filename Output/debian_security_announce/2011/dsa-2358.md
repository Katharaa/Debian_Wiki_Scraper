More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java platform. This combines the two previous
openjdk-6 advisories, [DSA-2311-1](https://www.debian.org/security/2011/dsa-2311) and
[DSA-2356-1](https://www.debian.org/security/2011/dsa-2356).


* [CVE-2011-0862](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0862)
Integer overflow errors in the JPEG and font parser allow
 untrusted code (including applets) to elevate its privileges.
* [CVE-2011-0864](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0864)
Hotspot, the just-in-time compiler in OpenJDK, mishandled
 certain byte code instructions, allowing untrusted code
 (including applets) to crash the virtual machine.
* [CVE-2011-0865](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0865)
A race condition in signed object deserialization could
 allow untrusted code to modify signed content, apparently
 leaving its signature intact.
* [CVE-2011-0867](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0867)
Untrusted code (including applets) could access information
 about network interfaces which was not intended to be public.
 (Note that the interface MAC address is still available to
 untrusted code.)
* [CVE-2011-0868](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0868)
A float-to-long conversion could overflow, allowing
 untrusted code (including applets) to crash the virtual
 machine.
* [CVE-2011-0869](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0869)
Untrusted code (including applets) could intercept HTTP
 requests by reconfiguring proxy settings through a SOAP
 connection.
* [CVE-2011-0871](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0871)
Untrusted code (including applets) could elevate its
 privileges through the Swing MediaTracker code.
* [CVE-2011-3389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3389)
The TLS implementation does not guard properly against certain
 chosen-plaintext attacks when block ciphers are used in CBC
 mode.
* [CVE-2011-3521](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3521)
The CORBA implementation contains a deserialization
 vulnerability in the IIOP implementation, allowing untrusted
 Java code (such as applets) to elevate its privileges.
* [CVE-2011-3544](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3544)
The Java scripting engine lacks necessary security manager
 checks, allowing untrusted Java code (such as applets) to
 elevate its privileges.
* [CVE-2011-3547](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3547)
The skip() method in java.io.InputStream uses a shared buffer,
 allowing untrusted Java code (such as applets) to access data
 that is skipped by other code.
* [CVE-2011-3548](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3548)
The java.awt.AWTKeyStroke class contains a flaw which allows
 untrusted Java code (such as applets) to elevate its
 privileges.
* [CVE-2011-3551](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3551)
The Java2D C code contains an integer overflow which results
 in a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially allowing
 untrusted Java code (such as applets) to elevate its
 privileges.
* [CVE-2011-3552](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3552)
Malicous Java code can use up an excessive amount of UDP
 ports, leading to a denial of service.
* [CVE-2011-3553](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3553)
JAX-WS enables stack traces for certain server responses by
 default, potentially leaking sensitive information.
* [CVE-2011-3554](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3554)
JAR files in pack200 format are not properly checked for
 errors, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution when
 unpacking crafted pack200 files.
* [CVE-2011-3556](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3556)
The RMI Registry server lacks access restrictions on certain
 methods, allowing a remote client to execute arbitary code.
* [CVE-2011-3557](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3557)
The RMI Registry server fails to properly restrict privileges
 of untrusted Java code, allowing RMI clients to elevate their
 privileges on the RMI Registry server.
* [CVE-2011-3560](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3560)
The com.sun.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection class does not perform
 proper security manager checks in the setSSLSocketFactory()
 method, allowing untrusted Java code to bypass security policy
 restrictions.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 6b18-1.8.10-0~lenny2.


We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.
