More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Django web development
framework:


* [CVE-2011-0696](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0696)
For several reasons the internal CSRF protection was not used to
 validate AJAX requests in the past. However, it was discovered that
 this exception can be exploited with a combination of browser plugins
 and redirects and thus is not sufficient.
* [CVE-2011-0697](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0697)
It was discovered that the file upload form is prone to cross-site
 scripting attacks via the file name.


It is important to note that this update introduces minor backward

For the exact details, please see: <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/releases/1.2.5>
and in particular the Backwards incompatible changes section.
