More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leak. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2010-0435](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0435)
Gleb Napatov reported an issue in the KVM subsystem that allows virtual
 machines to cause a denial of service of the host machine by executing mov
 to/from DR instructions.
* [CVE-2010-3699](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3699)
Keir Fraser provided a fix for an issue in the Xen subsystem. A guest can
 cause a denial of service on the host by retaining a leaked reference to a
 device. This can result in a zombie domain, xenwatch process hangs, and xm
 command failures.
* [CVE-2010-4158](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4158)
Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the socket filters subsystem, allowing
 local unprivileged users to obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2010-4162](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4162)
Dan Rosenberg discovered an overflow issue in the block I/O subsystem that
 allows local users to map large numbers of pages, resulting in a denial of
 service due to invocation of the out of memory killer.
* [CVE-2010-4163](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4163)
Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the block I/O subsystem. Due to
 improper validation of iov segments, local users can trigger a kernel panic
 resulting in a denial of service.
* [CVE-2010-4242](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4242)
Alan Cox reported an issue in the Bluetooth subsystem. Local users with
 sufficient permission to access HCI UART devices can cause a denial of
 service (NULL pointer dereference) due to a missing check for an existing
 tty write operation.
* [CVE-2010-4243](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4243)
Brad Spengler reported a denial-of-service issue in the kernel memory
 accounting system. By passing large argv/envp values to exec, local users
 can cause the out of memory killer to kill processes owned by other users.
* [CVE-2010-4248](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4248)
Oleg Nesterov reported an issue in the POSIX CPU timers subsystem. Local
 users can cause a denial of service (Oops) due to incorrect assumptions
 about thread group leader behavior.
* [CVE-2010-4249](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4249)
Vegard Nossum reported an issue with the UNIX socket garbage collector.
 Local users can consume all of LOWMEM and decrease system performance by
 overloading the system with inflight sockets.
* [CVE-2010-4258](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4258)
Nelson Elhage reported an issue in Linux oops handling. Local users may be
 able to obtain elevated privileges if they are able to trigger an oops with
 a process' fs set to KERNEL\_DS.
* [CVE-2010-4342](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4342)
Nelson Elhage reported an issue in the Econet protocol. Remote attackers can
 cause a denial of service by sending an Acorn Universal Networking packet
 over UDP.
* [CVE-2010-4346](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4346)
Tavis Ormandy discovered an issue in the install\_special\_mapping routine
 which allows local users to bypass the mmap\_min\_addr security restriction.
 Combined with an otherwise low severity local denial of service
 vulnerability (NULL pointer dereference), a local user could obtain elevated
 privileges.
* [CVE-2010-4526](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4526)
Eugene Teo reported a race condition in the Linux SCTP implementation.
 Remote users can cause a denial of service (kernel memory corruption) by
 transmitting an ICMP unreachable message to a locked socket.
* [CVE-2010-4527](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4527)
Dan Rosenberg reported two issues in the OSS soundcard driver. Local users
 with access to the device (members of group 'audio' on default Debian
 installations) may access to sensitive kernel memory or cause a
 buffer overflow, potentially leading to an escalation of privileges.
* [CVE-2010-4529](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4529)
Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the Linux kernel IrDA socket
 implementation on non-x86 architectures. Local users may be able to gain
 access to sensitive kernel memory via a specially crafted IRLMP\_ENUMDEVICES
 getsockopt call.
* [CVE-2010-4565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4565)
Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the Linux CAN protocol implementation.
 Local users can obtain the address of a kernel heap object which might help
 facilitate system exploitation.
* [CVE-2010-4649](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4649)
Dan Carpenter reported an issue in the uverb handling of the InfiniBand
 subsystem. A potential buffer overflow may allow local users to cause a
 denial of service (memory corruption) by passing in a large cmd.ne value.
* [CVE-2010-4656](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4656)
Kees Cook reported an issue in the driver for I/O-Warrior USB devices.
 Local users with access to these devices may be able to overrun kernel
 buffers, resulting in a denial of service or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2010-4668](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4668)
Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the block subsystem. A local user can
 cause a denial of service (kernel panic) by submitting certain 0-length I/O
 requests.
* [CVE-2011-0521](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0521)
Dan Carpenter reported an issue in the DVB driver for AV7110 cards. Local
 users can pass a negative info->num value, corrupting kernel memory and
 causing a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.26-26lenny2.


The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:




|  | Debian 5.0 (lenny) |
| --- | --- |
