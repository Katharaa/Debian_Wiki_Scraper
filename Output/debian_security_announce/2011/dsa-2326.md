DSA-2326-1 pam -- several vulnerabilities
-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 Oct 2011
Affected Packages:

[pam](https://packages.debian.org/src:pam)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-3148](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3148), [CVE-2011-3149](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3149).  

More information:

Kees Cook of the ChromeOS security team discovered a buffer overflow
in pam\_env, a PAM module to set environment variables through the
PAM stack, which allowed the execution of arbitrary code. An additional
issue in argument parsing allows denial of service.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.1-6.1+squeeze1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon
(the impact in sid is limited to denial of service for both issues).


We recommend that you upgrade your pam packages.
