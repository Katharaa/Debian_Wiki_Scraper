DSA-2323-1 radvd -- several vulnerabilities
-------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
26 Oct 2011
Affected Packages:

[radvd](https://packages.debian.org/src:radvd)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 644614](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=644614).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-3602](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3602), [CVE-2011-3604](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3604), [CVE-2011-3605](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3605).  

More information:

Multiple security issues were discovered by Vasiliy Kulikov in radvd, an
IPv6 Router Advertisement daemon:


* [CVE-2011-3602](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3602)
set\_interface\_var() function doesn't check the interface name, which is
 chosen by an unprivileged user. This could lead to an arbitrary file
 overwrite if the attacker has local access, or specific files overwrites
 otherwise.
* [CVE-2011-3604](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3604)
process\_ra() function lacks multiple buffer length checks which could
 lead to memory reads outside the stack, causing a crash of the daemon.
* [CVE-2011-3605](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3605)
process\_rs() function calls mdelay() (a function to wait for a defined
 time) unconditionnally when running in unicast-only mode. As this call
 is in the main thread, that means all request processing is delayed (for
 a time up to MAX\_RA\_DELAY\_TIME, 500 ms by default). An attacker could
 flood the daemon with router solicitations in order to fill the input
 queue, causing a temporary denial of service (processing would be
 stopped during all the mdelay() calls).
  

 Note: upstream and Debian default is to use anycast mode.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.1-3.1.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.6-1.1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.8-1.2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.8-1.2.


We recommend that you upgrade your radvd packages.
