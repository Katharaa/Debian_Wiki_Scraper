---------------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[icedove](https://packages.debian.org/src:icedove)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-3647](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3647), [CVE-2011-3648](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3648), [CVE-2011-3650](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3650).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, a mail client
based on Thunderbird.


* [CVE-2011-3647](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3647)
The JSSubScriptLoader does not properly handle
 XPCNativeWrappers during calls to the loadSubScript method in
 an add-on, which makes it easier for remote attackers to gain
 privileges via a crafted web site that leverages certain
 unwrapping behavior.
* [CVE-2011-3648](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3648)
A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows remote
 attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted
 text with Shift JIS encoding.
* [CVE-2011-3650](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3650)
Iceweasel does not properly handle JavaScript files that
 contain many functions, which allows user-assisted remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
 application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
 via a crafted file that is accessed by debugging APIs, as
 demonstrated by Firebug.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.0.11-1+squeeze6.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 3.1.15-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
