More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in FFmpeg, a multimedia player,
server and encoder.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:


* [CVE-2010-3908](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3908)
FFmpeg before 0.5.4, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code
 via a malformed WMV file.
* [CVE-2010-4704](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4704)
libavcodec/vorbis\_dec.c in the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted
 Ogg file, related to the vorbis\_floor0\_decode function.
* [CVE-2011-0480](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0480)
Multiple buffer overflows in vorbis\_dec.c in the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg
 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
 application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
 WebM file, related to buffers for the channel floor and the channel residue.
* [CVE-2011-0722](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0722)
FFmpeg allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory
 corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a
 malformed RealMedia file.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.5.4-1.


Security support for ffmpeg has been discontinued for the oldstable
distribution (lenny).
The current version in oldstable is not supported by upstream anymore
and is affected by several security issues. Backporting fixes for these
and any future issues has become unfeasible and therefore we need to
drop our security support for the version in oldstable.


We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.
