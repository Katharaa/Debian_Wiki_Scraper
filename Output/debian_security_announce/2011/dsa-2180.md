The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape package only
provides the XPCOM code.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.12-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.
