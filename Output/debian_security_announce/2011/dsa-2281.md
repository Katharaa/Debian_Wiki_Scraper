More information:

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that opie, a system that makes it simple to use
One-Time passwords in applications, is prone to a privilege escalation
([CVE-2011-2490](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2490))
and an off-by-one error, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code
([CVE-2011-2489](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2489)).
Adam Zabrocki and Maksymilian Arciemowicz also discovered another off-by-one
error
([CVE-2010-1938](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1938)),
which only affects the lenny version as the fix was already included in
squeeze.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.32-10.2+lenny2.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.32.dfsg.1-0.2+squeeze1


The testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid) do
not contain opie.


We recommend that you upgrade your opie packages.
