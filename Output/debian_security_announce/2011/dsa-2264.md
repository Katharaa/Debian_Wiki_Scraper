 include a Yamaha FM synthesizer chip. Local users can cause memory
 corruption resulting in a denial of service. This issue does not affect
 official Debian Linux image packages as they no longer provide support for
 OSS. However, custom kernels built from Debians linux-source-2.6.26 may
 have enabled this configuration and would therefore be vulnerable.

Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Linux support for AGP devices.

 module initialization.
* [CVE-2011-1776](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1776)
Timo Warns reported an issue in the Linux implementation for GUID
 partitions. Users with physical access can gain access to sensitive kernel
 memory by adding a storage device with a specially crafted corrupted
 invalid partition table.
* [CVE-2011-2022](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2022)
Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Linux support for AGP devices.
 Local users can obtain elevated privileges or cause a denial of service due
 to missing bounds checking in the AGPIOC\_UNBIND ioctl. On default Debian
 installations, this is exploitable only by users in the video group.
* [CVE-2011-2182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2182)
Ben Hutchings reported an issue with the fix for [CVE-2011-1017](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1017) (see above)
 that made it insufficient to resolve the issue.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.26-26lenny3. Updates for arm and hppa are not yet available,
but will be released as soon as possible.


The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:




|  | Debian 5.0 (lenny) |
| --- | --- |
| user-mode-linux | 2.6.26-1um-2+26lenny3 |


We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
These updates will not become active until after your system is rebooted.


Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
Linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or leap-frog fashion.
