--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Nov 2011
Affected Packages:

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 641478](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=641478).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-3362](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3362), [CVE-2011-3973](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3973), [CVE-2011-3974](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3974), [CVE-2011-3504](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3504).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in FFmpeg, a multimedia player,
server and encoder:


* [CVE-2011-3362](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3362)
An integer signedness error in decode\_residual\_block function of
 the Chinese AVS video (CAVS) decoder in libavcodec can lead to
 denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or
 possible code execution via a crafted CAVS file.
* [CVE-2011-3973](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3973)/[CVE-2011-3974](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3974)
Multiple errors in the Chinese AVS video (CAVS) decoder can lead to
 denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via an
 invalid bitstream.
* [CVE-2011-3504](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3504)
A memory allocation problem in the Matroska format decoder can lead
 to code execution via a crafted file.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.5.5-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.7.2-1 of the libav source package.


Security support for ffmpeg has been discontinued for the oldstable
distribution (lenny) before in [DSA 2306](https://www.debian.org/security/2011/dsa-2306).
The current version in oldstable is not supported by upstream anymore
and is affected by several security issues. Backporting fixes for these
and any future issues has become unfeasible and therefore we needed to
drop our security support for the version in oldstable.


We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.
