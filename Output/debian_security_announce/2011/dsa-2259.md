Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2259-1 fex -- authentication bypass
---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
12 Jun 2011
Affected Packages:

[fex](https://packages.debian.org/src:fex)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-1409](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1409).  

More information:

It was discovered that F\*EX, a web service for transferring very large
files, is not properly validating authentication IDs. While the service
properly validates existing authentication IDs, an attacker who is not
specifying any authentication ID at all can bypass the authentication
procedure.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not include fex.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 20100208+debian1-1+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 20110610-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your fex packages.
