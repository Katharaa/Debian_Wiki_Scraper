More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in FFmpeg coders, which are used
by MPlayer and other applications.


* [CVE-2010-3429](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3429)
Cesar Bernardini and Felipe Andres Manzano reported an arbitrary offset
 dereference vulnerability in the libavcodec, in particular in the FLIC file
 format parser. A specific FLIC file may exploit this vulnerability and execute
 arbitrary code. Mplayer is also affected by this problem, as well as other
 software that use this library.
* [CVE-2010-4704](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4704)
Greg Maxwell discovered an integer overflow the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg. A
 specific Ogg file may exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2010-4705](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4705)
A potential integer overflow has been discovered in the Vorbis decoder in
 FFmpeg.


This upload also fixes an incomplete patch from DSA-2000-1. Michael Gilbert
noticed that there was remaining vulnerabilities, which may cause a denial of
service and potentially execution of arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.svn20080206-18+lenny3.


We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg-debian packages.
