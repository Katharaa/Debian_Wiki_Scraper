Vasiliy Kulikov of OpenWall discovered that the socket handling
 is vulnerable to denial of service.
* [CVE-2011-2777](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2777)
Oliver-Tobias Ripka discovered that incorrect process handling in
 the Debian-specific powerbtn.sh script could lead to local
 privilege escalation. This issue doesn't affect oldstable. The
 script is only shipped as an example in /usr/share/doc/acpid/examples.
 See /usr/share/doc/acpid/README.Debian for details.
* [CVE-2011-4578](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4578)
Helmut Grohne and Michael Biebl discovered that acpid sets a umask
 of 0 when executing scripts, which could result in local privilege
 escalation.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.8-1lenny4.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.0.7-1squeeze3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your acpid packages.
