Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2162-1 openssl -- invalid memory access
-------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
14 Feb 2011
Affected Packages:

[openssl](https://packages.debian.org/src:openssl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-0014](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0014).  

More information:

Neel Mehta discovered that an incorrectly formatted ClientHello handshake
message could cause OpenSSL to parse past the end of the message. This
allows an attacker to crash an application using OpenSSL by triggering
an invalid memory access. Additionally, some applications may be vulnerable
to expose contents of a parsed OCSP nonce extension.
