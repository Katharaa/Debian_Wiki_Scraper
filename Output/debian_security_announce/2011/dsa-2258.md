Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 629350](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=629350).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-1926](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1926).  

More information:

It was discovered that the STARTTLS implementation of the
Kolab Cyrus IMAP server does not properly restrict I/O buffering,
which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted
IMAP, LMTP, NNTP and POP3 sessions by sending a cleartext command that is
processed after TLS is in place.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-5+lenny3.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-9.1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13p1-0.1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13p1-0.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your kolab-cyrus-imapd packages.
