========================


DSA-2202-1 apache2 -- failure to drop root privileges
-----------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
23 Mar 2011
Affected Packages:

[apache2](https://packages.debian.org/src:apache2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 618857](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=618857).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-1176](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1176).  

More information:

MPM\_ITK is an alternative Multi-Processing Module for Apache HTTPD that
is included in Debian's apache2 package.


A configuration parsing flaw has been found in MPM\_ITK. If the
configuration directive NiceValue was set, but no AssignUserID directive
was specified, the requests would be processed as user and group root
instead of the default Apache user and group.


This issue does not affect the standard Apache HTTPD MPMs prefork,
worker, and event.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.16-6+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.2.17-2.


If you use apache2-mpm-itk, we recommend that you upgrade your apache2
packages.
