 process could lead to denial of service or the execution of
 arbitrary code.

It was discovered that insufficient error handling in the
 kernel module could lead to denial of service.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.7.dfsg1-6+lenny4. Due to a technical problem with the
buildd infrastructure the update is not yet available, but will be
installed into the archive soon.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.12.1+dfsg-4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages. Note that in order
to apply this security update, you must rebuild the OpenAFS kernel module.
