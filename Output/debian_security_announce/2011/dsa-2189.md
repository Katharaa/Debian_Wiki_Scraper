More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Chromium browser.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


* [CVE-2011-1108](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1108)
Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 does not properly implement JavaScript
 dialogs, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
 HTML document.
* [CVE-2011-1109](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1109)
Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 does not properly process nodes in Cascading
 Style Sheets (CSS) stylesheets, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown
 vectors that lead to a stale pointer.
* [CVE-2011-1113](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1113)
Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 on 64-bit Linux platforms does not properly
 perform pickle deserialization, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors.
* [CVE-2011-1114](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1114)
Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 does not properly handle tables, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a stale node.
* [CVE-2011-1115](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1115)
Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 does not properly render tables, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a stale pointer.
* [CVE-2011-1121](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1121)
Integer overflow in Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via
 vectors involving a TEXTAREA element.
* [CVE-2011-1122](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1122)
The WebGL implementation in Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified
 vectors, aka Issue 71960.
* In addition, this upload fixes the following issues (they don't have a CVE
 id yet):


	+ Out-of-bounds read in text searching. [69640]
	+ Memory corruption in SVG fonts. [72134]
	+ Memory corruption with counter nodes. [69628]
