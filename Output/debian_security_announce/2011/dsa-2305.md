DSA-2305-1 vsftpd -- denial of service
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
19 Sep 2011
Affected Packages:

[vsftpd](https://packages.debian.org/src:vsftpd)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 622741](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=622741), [Bug 629373](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=629373).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-0762](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0762), [CVE-2011-2189](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2189).  

More information:

Two security issue have been discovered that affect vsftpd, a lightweight,
efficient FTP server written for security.


* [CVE-2011-2189](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2189)
It was discovered that Linux kernels < 2.6.35 are considerably slower in
 releasing than in the creation of network namespaces. As a result of this
 and because vsftpd is using this feature as a security enhancement to
 provide network isolation for connections, it is possible to cause denial
 of service conditions due to excessive memory allocations by the kernel.
 This is technically no vsftpd flaw, but a kernel issue. However, this
 feature has legitimate use cases and backporting the specific kernel patch
 is too intrusive. Additionally, a local attacker requires the CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN
 capability to abuse this functionality. Therefore, as a fix, a kernel
 version check has been added to vsftpd in order to disable this feature
 for kernels < 2.6.35.
* [CVE-2011-0762](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0762)
Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that vsftpd is incorrectly handling
 certain glob expressions in STAT commands. This allows a remote authenticated
 attacker to conduct denial of service attacks (excessive CPU and process
 slot exhaustion) via crafted STAT commands.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.7-1+lenny1.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.2-3+squeeze2. Please note that
[CVE-2011-2189](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2189) does not affect the lenny version.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.4-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your vsftpd packages.
