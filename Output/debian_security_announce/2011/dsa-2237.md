Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2237-1 apr -- denial of service
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
15 May 2011
Affected Packages:

[apr](https://packages.debian.org/src:apr)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-0419](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0419).  

More information:

A flaw was found in the APR library, which could be exploited through
Apache HTTPD's mod\_autoindex. If a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex
contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could
send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU
usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.12-5+lenny3.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.2-6+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed in
version 1.4.4-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your apr packages and restart the
apache2 server.
