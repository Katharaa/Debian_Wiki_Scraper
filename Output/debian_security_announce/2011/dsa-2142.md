Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2142-1 dpkg -- directory traversal
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
06 Jan 2011
Affected Packages:

[dpkg](https://packages.debian.org/src:dpkg)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2010-1679](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1679).  

More information:

Jakub Wilk discovered that the dpkg-source component of dpkg, the Debian
package management system, doesn't correctly handle paths in patches of
source packages, which could make it traverse directories.
RaphaÃ«l Hertzog additionally discovered that symbolic links in the .pc
directory are followed, which could make it traverse directories too.


Both issues only affect source packages using the "3.0 quilt" format at
unpack-time.


For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.14.31.


For the testing (squeeze) and unstable distributions (sid),
these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.
