More information:

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java platform.


* [CVE-2010-4351](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4351)
The JNLP SecurityManager returns from the checkPermission method
 instead of throwing an exception in certain circumstances, which
 might allow context-dependent attackers to bypass the intended
 security policy by creating instances of ClassLoader.
* [CVE-2010-4448](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4448)
Malicious applets can perform DNS cache poisoning.
* [CVE-2010-4450](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4450)
An empty (but set) LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable results in
 a misconstructed library search path, resulting in code execution
 from possibly untrusted sources.
* [CVE-2010-4465](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4465)
Malicious applets can extend their privileges by abusing Swing
 timers.
* [CVE-2010-4469](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4469)
The Hotspot just-in-time compiler miscompiles crafted byte
 sequences, resulting in heap corruption.
* [CVE-2010-4470](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4470)
JAXP can be exploited by untrusted code to elevate privileges.
* [CVE-2010-4471](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4471)
Java2D can be exploited by untrusted code to elevate privileges.
* [CVE-2010-4472](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4472)
Untrusted code can replace the XML DSIG implementation.
* [CVE-2011-0025](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0025)
Signatures on JAR files are not properly verified, which allows
 remote attackers to trick users into executing code that appears
 to come from a trusted source.
* [CVE-2011-0706](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0706)
The JNLPClassLoader class allows remote attackers to gain
 privileges via unknown vectors related to multiple signers and the
 assignment of an inappropriate security descriptor.



In addition, this security update contains stability fixes, such as
switching to the recommended Hotspot version (hs14) for this
particular version of OpenJDK.



For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.7-2~lenny1.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.7-2~squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.8.7-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.
