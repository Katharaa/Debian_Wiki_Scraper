Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-3848](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3848), [CVE-2011-3870](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3870), [CVE-2011-3869](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3869), [CVE-2011-3871](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3871).  

More information:

Multiple security issues have been discovered in Puppet, a centralized
configuration management system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2011-3848](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3848)
Kristian Erik Hermansen reported that an unauthenticated
 directory traversal could drop any valid X.509 Certificate Signing
 Request at any location on disk, with the privileges of the Puppet
 Master application.
* [CVE-2011-3870](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3870)
Ricky Zhou discovered a potential local privilege escalation in the
 ssh\_authorized\_keys resource and theoretically in the Solaris and
 AIX providers, where file ownership was given away before it was
 written, leading to a possibility for a user to overwrite arbitrary
 files as root, if their authorized\_keys file was managed.
* [CVE-2011-3869](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3869)
A predictable file name in the k5login type leads to the possibility
 of symlink attacks which would allow the owner of the home directory
 to symlink to anything on the system, and have it replaced with the
 correct content of the file, which can lead to a privilege escalation
 on puppet runs.
* [CVE-2011-3871](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3871)
A potential local privilege escalation was found in the --edit mode
 of puppet resource due to a persistent, predictable file name,
 which can result in editing an arbitrary target file, and thus be
 be tricked into running that arbitrary file as the invoking
 user. This command is most commonly run as root, this leads to a
 potential privilege escalation.


Additionally, this update hardens the indirector file backed terminus base
class against injection attacks based on trusted path names.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.2-5+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.3-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.3-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.
