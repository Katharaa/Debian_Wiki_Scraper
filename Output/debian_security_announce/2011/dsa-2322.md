More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Bugzilla, a web-based bug
tracking system.


* [CVE-2010-4572](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4572)
By inserting particular strings into certain URLs, it was
 possible to inject both headers and content to any
 browser.
* [CVE-2010-4567](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4567), [CVE-2011-0048](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0048)
Bugzilla has a URL field that can contain several types
 of URL, including javascript: and data: URLs. However,
 it does not make javascript: and data: URLs into
 clickable links, to protect against cross-site scripting
 attacks or other attacks. It was possible to bypass this
 protection by adding spaces into the URL in places that
 Bugzilla did not expect them. Also, javascript: and
 data: links were **always** shown as clickable to
 logged-out users.
* [CVE-2010-4568](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4568)
It was possible for a user to gain unauthorized access to
 any Bugzilla account in a very short amount of time (short
 enough that the attack is highly effective).
* [CVE-2011-0046](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0046)
Various pages were vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
 Forgery attacks. Most of these issues are not as serious
 as previous CSRF vulnerabilities.
* [CVE-2011-2978](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2978)
When a user changes his email address, Bugzilla trusts
 a user-modifiable field for obtaining the current e-mail
 address to send a confirmation message to. If an attacker
 has access to the session of another user (for example,
 if that user left their browser window open in a public
 place), the attacker could alter this field to cause
 the email-change notification to go to their own address.
 This means that the user would not be notified that his
 account had its email address changed by the attacker.
* [CVE-2011-2381](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2381)
For flagmails only, attachment descriptions with a newline
 in them could lead to the injection of crafted headers in
 email notifications when an attachment flag is edited.
* [CVE-2011-2379](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2379)
Bugzilla uses an alternate host for attachments when
 viewing them in raw format to prevent cross-site scripting
 attacks. This alternate host is now also used when viewing
 patches in Raw Unified mode because Internet Explorer 8
 and older, and Safari before 5.0.6 do content sniffing,
 which could lead to the execution of malicious code.
* [CVE-2011-2380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2380), [CVE-2011-2979](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2979)
Normally, a group name is confidential and is only visible
 to members of the group, and to non-members if the group
 is used in bugs. By crafting the URL when creating or
 editing a bug, it was possible to guess if a group existed
 or not, even for groups which weren't used in bugs and so
 which were supposed to remain confidential.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), it has not been practical to
backport patches to fix these bugs. Users of bugzilla on lenny are
strongly advised to upgrade to the version in the squeeze distribution.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.2.0-4.4.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
the bugzilla packages have been removed.


We recommend that you upgrade your bugzilla packages.
