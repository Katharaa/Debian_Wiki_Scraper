Various vulnerabilities have been found in SquirrelMail, a webmail
application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:


* [CVE-2010-4554](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4554)
SquirrelMail did not prevent page rendering inside a third-party
 HTML frame, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
 clickjacking attacks via a crafted web site.
* [CVE-2010-4555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4555),
 [CVE-2011-2752](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2752),
 [CVE-2011-2753](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2753)
Multiple small bugs in SquirrelMail allowed an attacker to inject
 malicious script into various pages or alter the contents of user
 preferences.
* [CVE-2011-2023](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2023)
It was possible to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a
 crafted STYLE element in an HTML part of an e-mail message.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.15-4+lenny5.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.21-2.
