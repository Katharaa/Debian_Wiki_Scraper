 graphics translation table, resulting in denial of service or escalated
 privileges. On default Debian installations, this is exploitable only by
 members of the video group.
* [CVE-2011-1078](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1078)
Vasiliy Kulikov discovered an issue in the Bluetooth subsystem. Local users

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered an issue in the Bluetooth subsystem. Local users
 with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability can cause a denial of service (kernel
 Oops).
* [CVE-2011-1080](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1080)
Vasiliy Kulikov discovered an issue in the Netfilter subsystem. Local users

 partitions. Users with physical access can gain access to sensitive kernel
 memory by adding a storage device with a specially crafted OSF partition.
* [CVE-2011-1170](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1170)
Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Netfilter ARP table
 implementation. Local users with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability can gain
 access to sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2011-1171](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1171)
Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Netfilter IP table
 implementation. Local users with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability can gain

 implementation. Local users can obtain access to sensitive kernel memory on
 systems that use this rare hardware.
* [CVE-2011-1180](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1180)
Dan Rosenberg reported a buffer overflow in the Information Access Service
 of the IrDA protocol, used for Infrared devices. Remote attackers within IR
 device range can cause a denial of service or possibly gain elevated
 privileges.
* [CVE-2011-1182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1182)
Julien Tinnes reported an issue in the rt\_sigqueueinfo interface. Local
 users can generate signals with falsified source pid and uid information.
* [CVE-2011-1476](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1476)
Dan Rosenberg reported issues in the Open Sound System MIDI interface that
 allow local users to cause a denial of service. This issue does not affect
 official Debian Linux image packages as they no longer provide support for
 OSS. However, custom kernels built from Debian's linux-source-2.6.32 may
 have enabled this configuration and would therefore be vulnerable.
* [CVE-2011-1477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1477)
Dan Rosenberg reported issues in the Open Sound System driver for cards that
 include a Yamaha FM synthesizer chip. Local users can cause memory
 corruption resulting in a denial of service. This issue does not affect
 official Debian Linux image packages as they no longer provide support for
 OSS. However, custom kernels built from Debian's linux-source-2.6.32 may
 have enabled this configuration and would therefore be vulnerable.
* [CVE-2011-1478](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1478)
Ryan Sweat reported an issue in the Generic Receive Offload (GRO) support in
 the Linux networking subsystem. If an interface has GRO enabled and is
 running in promiscuous mode, remote users can cause a denial of service
 (NULL pointer dereference) by sending packets on an unknown VLAN.
* [CVE-2011-1493](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1493)
Dan Rosenburg reported two issues in the Linux implementation of the Amateur
 Radio X.25 PLP (Rose) protocol. A remote user can cause a denial of service
 by providing specially crafted facilities fields.
* [CVE-2011-1494](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1494)
Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the /dev/mpt2ctl interface provided by
 the driver for LSI MPT Fusion SAS 2.0 controllers. Local users can obtain
 elevated privileges by specially crafted ioctl calls. On default Debian
 installations this is not exploitable as this interface is only accessible
 to root.
* [CVE-2011-1495](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1495)
Dan Rosenberg reported two additional issues in the /dev/mpt2ctl interface
 provided by the driver for LSI MPT Fusion SAS 2.0 controllers. Local users
 can obtain elevated privileges and read arbitrary kernel memory by using
 specially crafted ioctl calls. On default Debian installations this is not
 exploitable as this interface is only accessible to root.
* [CVE-2011-1585](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1585)
Jeff Layton reported an issue in the Common Internet File System (CIFS).
 Local users can bypass authentication requirements for shares that are
 already mounted by another user.
* [CVE-2011-1593](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1593)
Robert Swiecki reported a signedness issue in the next\_pidmap() function,
 which can be exploited by local users to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2011-1598](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1598)
Dave Jones reported an issue in the Broadcast Manager Controller Area
 Network (CAN/BCM) protocol that may allow local users to cause a NULL
 pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service.
* [CVE-2011-1745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1745)
Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Linux support for AGP devices.
 Local users can obtain elevated privileges or cause a denial of service due
 to missing bounds checking in the AGPIOC\_BIND ioctl. On default Debian
 installations, this is exploitable only by users in the video group.
* [CVE-2011-1746](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1746)
Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Linux support for AGP devices.
 Local users can obtain elevated privileges or cause a denial of service due
 to missing bounds checking in the agp\_allocate\_memory and
 agp\_create\_user\_memory routines. On default Debian installations, this is exploitable
 only by users in the video group.
* [CVE-2011-1748](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1748)
Oliver Kartkopp reported an issue in the Controller Area Network (CAN) raw
 socket implementation which permits local users to cause a NULL pointer
 dereference, resulting in a denial of service.
* [CVE-2011-1759](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1759)
Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the support for executing old ABI
 binaries on ARM processors. Local users can obtain elevated privileges due
 to insufficient bounds checking in the semtimedop system call.

 initialization.
* [CVE-2011-1770](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1770)
Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol
 (DCCP). Remote users can cause a denial of service or potentially obtain
 access to sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2011-1776](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1776)
Timo Warns reported an issue in the Linux implementation for GUID
 partitions. Users with physical access can gain access to sensitive kernel
 memory by adding a storage device with a specially crafted corrupted invalid
 partition table.
* [CVE-2011-2022](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2022)
Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Linux support for AGP devices.
 Local users can obtain elevated privileges or cause a denial of service due
 to missing bounds checking in the AGPIOC\_UNBIND ioctl. On default Debian
 installations, this is exploitable only by users in the video group.


This update also includes changes queued for the next point release of
Debian 6.0, which also fix various non-security issues. These additional
changes are described in the
[package
changelog](https://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/l/linux-2.6/linux-2.6_2.6.32-34/changelog).


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.32-34squeeze1. Updates for issues impacting the oldstable
distribution (lenny) will be available soon.


The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:




|  | Debian 6.0 (squeeze) |
| --- | --- |
| user-mode-linux | 2.6.32-1um-4+34squeeze1 |


We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
