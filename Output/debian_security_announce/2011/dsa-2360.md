More information:


This is an advance notice that security support for Debian GNU/Linux 5.0
(code name "lenny") will be terminated in two months.




The Debian project released Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 alias "squeeze" on the
6th of February 2011. Users and distributors have been given a one-year
timeframe to upgrade their old installations to the current stable
release. Hence, the security support for the old release of 5.0 is going
to end on the 6th of February 2012 as previously announced.




Previously announced security updates for the old release will continue
to be available on security.debian.org.
