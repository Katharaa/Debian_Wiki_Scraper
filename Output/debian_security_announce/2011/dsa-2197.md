DSA-2197-1 quagga -- denial of service
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
21 Mar 2011
Affected Packages:

[quagga](https://packages.debian.org/src:quagga)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2010-1674](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1674), [CVE-2010-1675](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1675).  

More information:

It has been discovered that the Quagga routing daemon contains two
denial-of-service vulnerabilities in its BGP implementation:


* [CVE-2010-1674](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1674)
A crafted Extended Communities attribute triggers a NULL
 pointer dereference which causes the BGP daemon to crash.
 The crafted attributes are not propagated by the Internet
 core, so only explicitly configured direct peers are able
 to exploit this vulnerability in typical configurations.
* [CVE-2010-1675](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1675)
The BGP daemon resets BGP sessions when it encounters
 malformed AS\_PATHLIMIT attributes, introducing a distributed
 BGP session reset vulnerability which disrupts packet
 forwarding. Such malformed attributes are propagated by the
 Internet core, and exploitation of this vulnerability is not
 restricted to directly configured BGP peers.


This security update removes AS\_PATHLIMIT processing from the BGP
implementation, preserving the configuration statements for backwards
compatibility. (Standardization of this BGP extension was abandoned
long ago.)


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.10-1lenny5.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.17-2+squeeze2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.
