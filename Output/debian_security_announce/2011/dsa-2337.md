More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Xen virtual machine
hypervisor.


* [CVE-2011-1166](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1166)
A 64-bit guest can get one of its vCPUs into non-kernel
 mode without first providing a valid non-kernel pagetable,
 thereby locking up the host system.
* [CVE-2011-1583](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1583), [CVE-2011-3262](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3262)
Local users can cause a denial of service and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted paravirtualised guest kernel image.
* [CVE-2011-1898](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1898)
When using PCI passthrough on Intel VT-d chipsets that do not
 have interrupt remapping, guest OS users can gain host OS
 privileges by writing to the interrupt injection registers.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) contains a different version of Xen
not affected by these problems.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.1-4.


For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem
has been fixed in version 4.1.1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.
