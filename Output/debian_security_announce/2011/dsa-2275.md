Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2275-1 openoffice.org -- stack-based buffer overflow
--------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Jul 2011
Affected Packages:

[openoffice.org](https://packages.debian.org/src:openoffice.org)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
No other external database security references currently available.
More information:

Will Dormann and Jared Allar discovered that the Lotus Word Pro import
filter of OpenOffice.org, a full-featured office productivity suite that
provides a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft Office, is not
properly handling object ids in the .lwp file format. An attacker can
exploit this with a specially crafted file and execute arbitrary code with
the rights of the victim importing the file.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.2.1-11+squeeze3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
libreoffice version 1:3.3.3-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.
