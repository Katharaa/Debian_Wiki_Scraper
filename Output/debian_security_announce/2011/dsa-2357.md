More information:

Jon Larimer from IBM X-Force Advanced Research discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in the DVI backend of the Evince document viewer:


* [CVE-2010-2640](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2640)
Insufficient array bounds checks in the PK fonts parser could lead
 to function pointer overwrite, causing arbitrary code execution.
* [CVE-2010-2641](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2641)
Insufficient array bounds checks in the VF fonts parser could lead
 to function pointer overwrite, causing arbitrary code execution.
* [CVE-2010-2642](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2642)
Insufficient bounds checks in the AFM fonts parser when writing
 data to a memory buffer allocated on heap could lead to arbitrary
 memory overwrite and arbitrary code execution.
* [CVE-2010-2643](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2643)
Insufficient check on an integer used as a size for memory
 allocation can lead to arbitrary write outside the allocated range
 and cause arbitrary code execution.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.22.2-4~lenny2.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), [CVE-2010-2640](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2640), [CVE-2010-2641](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2641)
and [CVE-2010-2643](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2643) have been fixed in version 2.30.3-2 but the fix for
[CVE-2010-2642](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2642) was incomplete. The final fix is present in version
2.30.3-2+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.2-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your evince packages.
