---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Apr 2011
Affected Packages:

[tmux](https://packages.debian.org/src:tmux)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 620304](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=620304).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-1496](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1496).  

More information:

Daniel Danner discovered that tmux, a terminal multiplexer, is not
properly dropping group privileges. Due to a patch introduced by Debian,
when invoked with the -S option, tmux is not dropping permissions obtained
through its setgid installation.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem,
as it does not include tmux.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3-2+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-6.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your tmux packages.
