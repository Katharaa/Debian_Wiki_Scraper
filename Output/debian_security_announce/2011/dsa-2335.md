DSA-2335-1 man2html -- missing input sanitization
-------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[man2html](https://packages.debian.org/src:man2html)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-2770](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2770).  

More information:

Tim Starling discovered that the Debian-native CGI wrapper for man2html,
a program to convert UNIX man pages to HTML, is not properly escaping
user-supplied input when displaying various error messages. A remote
attacker can exploit this flaw to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6f-3+lenny1.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6f+repack-1+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6g-6.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6g-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your man2html packages.
