========================


DSA-2325-1 kfreebsd-8 -- privilege escalation/denial of service
---------------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
23 Oct 2011
Affected Packages:

[kfreebsd-8](https://packages.debian.org/src:kfreebsd-8)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-4062](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4062).  

More information:

Buffer overflow in the Linux emulation support in FreeBSD kernel
allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) and possibly
execute arbitrary code by calling the bind system call with a long path
for a UNIX-domain socket, which is not properly handled when the
address is used by other unspecified system calls.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.1+dfsg-8+squeeze2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.2-9.


We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-8 packages.
