DSA-2302-1 bcfg2 -- missing input sanitization
----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Sep 2011
Affected Packages:

[bcfg2](https://packages.debian.org/src:bcfg2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 640028](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=640028).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-3211](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3211).  

More information:

It has been discovered that the Bcfg2 server, a configuration management
server for Bcfg2 clients, is not properly sanitizing input from Bcfg2
clients before passing it to various shell commands. This enables an
attacker in control of a Bcfg2 client to execute arbitrary commands on
the server with root privileges.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.5.7-1.1+lenny1.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-3+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your bcfg2 packages.
