More information:

Several security related problems have been discovered in the
OpenOffice.org package that allows malformed documents to trick the
system into crashes or even the execution of arbitrary code.


* [CVE-2010-3450](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3450)
During an internal security audit within Red Hat, a directory
 traversal vulnerability has been discovered in the way
 OpenOffice.org 3.1.1 through 3.2.1 processes XML filter files. If
 a local user is tricked into opening a specially-crafted OOo XML
 filters package file, this problem could allow remote attackers to
 create or overwrite arbitrary files belonging to local user or,
 potentially, execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2010-3451](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3451)
During his work as a consultant at Virtual Security Research
 (VSR), Dan Rosenberg discovered a vulnerability in
 OpenOffice.org's RTF parsing functionality. Opening a maliciously
 crafted RTF document can cause an out-of-bounds memory read into
 previously allocated heap memory, which may lead to the execution
 of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2010-3452](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3452)
Dan Rosenberg discovered a vulnerability in the RTF file parser
 which can be leveraged by attackers to achieve arbitrary code
 execution by convincing a victim to open a maliciously crafted RTF
 file.
* [CVE-2010-3453](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3453)
As part of his work with Virtual Security Research, Dan Rosenberg
 discovered a vulnerability in the WW8ListManager::WW8ListManager()
 function of OpenOffice.org that allows a maliciously crafted file
 to cause the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2010-3454](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3454)
As part of his work with Virtual Security Research, Dan Rosenberg
 discovered a vulnerability in the WW8DopTypography::ReadFromMem()
 function in OpenOffice.org that may be exploited by a maliciously
 crafted file which allows an attacker to control program flow
 and potentially execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2010-3689](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3689)
Dmitri Gribenko discovered that the soffice script does not treat
 an empty LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH variable like an unset one, which may lead to
 the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2010-4253](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4253)
A heap based buffer overflow has been discovered with unknown
 impact.
* [CVE-2010-4643](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4643)
A vulnerability has been discovered in the way OpenOffice.org
 handles TGA graphics which can be tricked by a specially crafted
 TGA file that could cause the program to crash due to a heap-based
 buffer overflow with unknown impact.


For the stable distribution (lenny) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.1+dfsg-1+lenny11.


For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) these problems have
been fixed in version 3.2.1-11+squeeze1.


For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.1-11+squeeze1.


For the experimental distribution these problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.0~rc3-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your OpenOffice.org packages.
