Affected Packages:

[vlc](https://packages.debian.org/src:vlc)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-0531](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0531).  

More information:

Dan Rosenberg discovered that insufficient input validation in VLC's
processing of Matroska/WebM containers could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-1squeeze3.


The version of vlc in the oldstable distribution (lenny) is affected
by further issues and will be addressed in a followup DSA.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.7-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.
