More information:

It was discovered that PostgreSQL's intarray contrib module does not
properly handle integers with a large number of digits, leading to a
server crash and potentially arbitrary code execution.


For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.3.14-0lenny1 of the postgresql-8.3 package.


For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.7-0squeeze1 of the postgresql-8.4 package.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.7-1 of the postgresql-8.4 package and version 9.0.3-1 of
the postgresql-9.0 package.


The updates also include reliability improvements; for details see the
respective changelogs.


We recommend that you upgrade your PostgreSQL packages.
