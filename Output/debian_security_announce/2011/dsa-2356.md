More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java platform:


* [CVE-2011-3389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3389)
The TLS implementation does not guard properly against certain
 chosen-plaintext attacks when block ciphers are used in CBC
 mode.
* [CVE-2011-3521](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3521)
The CORBA implementation contains a deserialization
 vulnerability in the IIOP implementation, allowing untrusted
 Java code (such as applets) to elevate its privileges.
* [CVE-2011-3544](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3544)
The Java scripting engine lacks necessary security manager
 checks, allowing untrusted Java code (such as applets) to
 elevate its privileges.
* [CVE-2011-3547](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3547)
The skip() method in java.io.InputStream uses a shared buffer,
 allowing untrusted Java code (such as applets) to access data
 that is skipped by other code.
* [CVE-2011-3548](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3548)
The java.awt.AWTKeyStroke class contains a flaw which allows
 untrusted Java code (such as applets) to elevate its
 privileges.
* [CVE-2011-3551](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3551)
The Java2D C code contains an integer overflow which results
 in a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially allowing
 untrusted Java code (such as applets) to elevate its
 privileges.
* [CVE-2011-3552](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3552)
Malicous Java code can use up an excessive amount of UDP
 ports, leading to a denial of service.
* [CVE-2011-3553](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3553)
JAX-WS enables stack traces for certain server responses by
 default, potentially leaking sensitive information.
* [CVE-2011-3554](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3554)
JAR files in pack200 format are not properly checked for
 errors, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution when
 unpacking crafted pack200 files.
* [CVE-2011-3556](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3556)
The RMI Registry server lacks access restrictions on certain
 methods, allowing a remote client to execute arbitary code.
* [CVE-2011-3557](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3557)
The RMI Registry server fails to properly restrict privileges
 of untrusted Java code, allowing RMI clients to elevate their
 privileges on the RMI Registry server.
* [CVE-2011-3560](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3560)
The com.sun.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection class does not perform
 proper security manager checks in the setSSLSocketFactory()
 method, allowing untrusted Java code to bypass security policy
 restrictions.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.10-0+squeeze2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 6b23~pre11-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.
