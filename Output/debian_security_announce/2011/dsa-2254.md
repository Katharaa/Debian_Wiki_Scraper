More information:

OProfile is a performance profiling tool which is configurable by opcontrol, its
control utility. Stephane Chauveau reported several ways to inject arbitrary
commands in the arguments of this utility. If a local unprivileged user is
authorized by sudoers file to run opcontrol as root, this user could use the
flaw to escalate his privileges.
