More information:

Paul McMillan, Mozilla and the Django core team discovered several
vulnerabilities in Django, a Python web framework:


* [CVE-2011-4136](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4136)
When using memory-based sessions and caching, Django sessions are
 stored directly in the root namespace of the cache. When user data is
 stored in the same cache, a remote user may take over a session.
* [CVE-2011-4137](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4137), [CVE-2011-4138](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4138)
Django's field type URLfield by default checks supplied URL's by
 issuing a request to it, which doesn't time out. A Denial of Service
 is possible by supplying specially prepared URL's that keep the
 connection open indefinately or fill the Django's server memory.
* [CVE-2011-4139](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4139)
Django used X-Forwarded-Host headers to construct full URL's. This
 header may not contain trusted input and could be used to poison the
 cache.
* [CVE-2011-4140](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4140)
The CSRF protection mechanism in Django does not properly handle
 web-server configurations supporting arbitrary HTTP Host headers,
 which allows remote attackers to trigger unauthenticated forged
 requests.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-1+lenny3.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze2.


For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem
has been fixed in version 1.3.1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
