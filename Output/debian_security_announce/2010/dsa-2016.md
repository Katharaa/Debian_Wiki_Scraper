DSA-2016-1 drupal6 -- several vulnerabilities
---------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
13 Mar 2010
Affected Packages:

[drupal6](https://packages.debian.org/src:drupal6)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 572439](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=572439).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities (SA-CORE-2010-001) have been discovered in
drupal6, a fully-featured content management framework.


### Installation cross site scripting


A user-supplied value is directly output during installation allowing a
malicious user to craft a URL and perform a cross-site scripting attack.
The exploit can only be conducted on sites not yet installed.


### Open redirection


The API function drupal\_goto() is susceptible to a phishing attack.
An attacker could formulate a redirect in a way that gets the Drupal site
to send the user to an arbitrarily provided URL.
No user submitted data will be sent to that URL.


### Locale module cross site scripting


Locale module and dependent contributed modules do not sanitize the display
of language codes, native and English language names properly.
While these usually come from a preselected list, arbitrary administrator
input is allowed.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker must have a
role with the 'administer languages' permission.


### Blocked user session regeneration


Under certain circumstances, a user with an open session that is blocked
can maintain his/her session on the Drupal site, despite being blocked.


For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.6-3lenny5.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.16-1, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
shortly.


We recommend that you upgrade your drupal6 package.



Fixed in:

### Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 (lenny)
