Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a tool

project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2010-4329](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4329)
Cross site scripting was possible in search, that allowed
 a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

Display of PHP's phpinfo() function was available to world, but only

For the testing (squeeze) and unstable distribution (sid), these problems
