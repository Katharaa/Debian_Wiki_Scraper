DSA-2104-1 quagga -- several vulnerabilities
--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
06 Sep 2010
Affected Packages:

[quagga](https://packages.debian.org/src:quagga)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 594262](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=594262).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2010-2948](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2948), [CVE-2010-2949](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2949).  

More information:

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the BGP
implementation of Quagga, a routing daemon.


The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


* [CVE-2010-2948](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2948)
When processing a crafted Route Refresh message received
 from a configured, authenticated BGP neighbor, Quagga
 may crash, leading to a denial of service.
* [CVE-2010-2949](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2949)
When processing certain crafted AS paths, Quagga would crash
 with a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a denial of
 service. In some configurations, such crafted AS paths could
 be relayed by intermediate BGP routers.


In addition, this update contains a reliability fix: Quagga will no
longer advertise confederation-related AS paths to non-confederation
peers, and reject unexpected confederation-related AS paths by
resetting the session with the BGP peer which is advertising them.
(Previously, such AS paths would trigger resets of unrelated BGP
sessions.)


For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.99.10-1lenny3.


For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version 0.99.17-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your quagga package.



Fixed in:

### Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 (lenny)
