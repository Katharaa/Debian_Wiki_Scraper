Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2136-1 tor -- buffer overflow
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
21 Dec 2010
Affected Packages:

[tor](https://packages.debian.org/src:tor)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2010-1676](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1676).  

More information:

Willem Pinckaers discovered that Tor, a tool to enable online anonymity,
does not correctly handle all data read from the network. By supplying
specially crafted packets a remote attacker can cause Tor to overflow its
heap, crashing the process. Arbitrary code execution has not been
confirmed but there is a potential risk.


In the stable distribution (lenny), this update also includes an update of
the IP address for the Tor directory authority gabelmoo and addresses
a weakness in the package's postinst maintainer script.


For the stable distribution (lenny) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.26-1~lenny+4.


For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 0.2.1.26-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.
