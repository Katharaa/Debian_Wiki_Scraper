More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in mahara, an electronic portfolio,
weblog, and resume builder. The following Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project ids identify them:


* [CVE-2010-1667](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1667)
Multiple pages performed insufficient input sanitising, making them
 vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.
* [CVE-2010-1668](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1668)
Multiple forms lacked protection against cross-site request forgery
 attacks, therefore making them vulnerable.
* [CVE-2010-1670](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1670)
Gregor Anzelj discovered that it was possible to accidentally
 configure an installation of mahara that allows access to another
 user's account without a password.
* [CVE-2010-2479](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2479)
Certain Internet Explorer-specific cross-site scripting
 vulnerabilities were discovered in HTML Purifier, of which a copy
 is included in the mahara package.


For the stable distribution (lenny), the problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny6.


For the testing distribution (squeeze), the problems will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), the problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.5.


We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.



Fixed in:

### Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 (stable)
