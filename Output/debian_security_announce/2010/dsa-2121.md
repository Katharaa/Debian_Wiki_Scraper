In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2010-3714](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3714), [CVE-2010-3715](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3715), [CVE-2010-3716](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3716), [CVE-2010-3717](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3717).  

More information:

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in TYPO3. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:


* [CVE-2010-3714](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3714)
Multiple remote file disclosure vulnerabilities in the jumpUrl
 mechanism and the Extension Manager allowed attackers to read
 files with the privileges of the account under which the web
 server was running.
* [CVE-2010-3715](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3715)
The TYPO3 backend contained several cross-site scripting
 vulnerabilities, and the RemoveXSS function did not filter
 all Javascript code.
* [CVE-2010-3716](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3716)
Malicious editors with user creation permission could escalate
 their privileges by creating new users in arbitrary groups, due
 to lack of input validation in the taskcenter.
* [CVE-2010-3717](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3717)
TYPO3 exposed a crasher bug in the PHP filter\_var function,
 enabling attackers to cause the web server process to crash
 and thus consume additional system resources.


For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.5-1+lenny6.


For the unstable distribution (sid) and the upcoming stable
distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version
4.3.7-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your TYPO3 packages.



Fixed in:

### Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 (lenny)
