Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2134-1 -- upcoming changes in advisory format
-------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Dec 2010
Vulnerable:
No
Security database references:
No other external database security references currently available.
More information:

Traditionally Debian Security Advisories have included MD5 check sums
of the updated packages. This was introduced at a time when apt didn't
exist yet and BIND was at version 4.


Since apt cryptographically enforces the integrity of the archive for
quite some time now, we've decided to finally drop the hash values
from our advisory mails.


We'll also change some details of the advisory format in the upcoming
months.
