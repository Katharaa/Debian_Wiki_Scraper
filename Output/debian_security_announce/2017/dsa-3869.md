----------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[tnef](https://packages.debian.org/src:tnef)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 862442](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=862442).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-8911](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8911).  

More information:

It was discovered that tnef, a tool used to unpack MIME attachments of
type "application/ms-tnef", did not correctly validate its input. An
attacker could exploit this by tricking a user into opening a
malicious attachment, which would result in a denial-of-service by
application crash.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.9-1+deb8u3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.12-1.2.


We recommend that you upgrade your tnef packages.
