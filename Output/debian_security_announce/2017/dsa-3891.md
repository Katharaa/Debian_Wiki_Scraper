More information:

Aniket Nandkishor Kulkarni discovered that in tomcat8, a servlet and
JSP engine, static error pages used the original request's HTTP method
to serve content, instead of systematically using the GET method. This
could under certain conditions result in undesirable results,
including the replacement or removal of the custom error page.

in version 8.0.14-1+deb8u10.
