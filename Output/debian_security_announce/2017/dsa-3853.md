More information:

It was discovered that bitlbee, an IRC to other chat networks gateway,

service (via application crash), or potentially execute arbitrary
commands.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.2-2+deb8u1.


For the upcoming stable (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions,
these problems have been fixed in version 3.5-1.
