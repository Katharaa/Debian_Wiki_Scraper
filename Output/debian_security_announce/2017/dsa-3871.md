Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3871-1 zookeeper -- security update
---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
01 Jun 2017
Affected Packages:

[zookeeper](https://packages.debian.org/src:zookeeper)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-5637](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5637).  

More information:

It was discovered that Zookeeper, a service for maintaining
configuration information, didn't restrict access to the computationally
expensive wchp/wchc commands which could result in denial of service by
elevated CPU consumption.


This update disables those two commands by default. The new
configuration option 4lw.commands.whitelist can be used to whitelist
commands selectively (and the full set of commands can be restored
with '\*')


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.5+dfsg-2+deb8u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your zookeeper packages.
