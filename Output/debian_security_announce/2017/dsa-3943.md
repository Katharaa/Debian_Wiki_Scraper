========================


DSA-3943-1 gajim -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
14 Aug 2017
Affected Packages:

[gajim](https://packages.debian.org/src:gajim)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 863445](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=863445).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-10376](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10376).  

More information:

Gajim, a GTK+-based XMPP/Jabber client, unconditionally implements the
"XEP-0146: Remote Controlling Clients" extension, allowing a malicious
XMPP server to trigger commands to leak private conversations from
encrypted sessions. With this update XEP-0146 support has been disabled
by default and made opt-in via the remote\_commands option.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.16-1+deb8u2.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed prior
to the initial release.


We recommend that you upgrade your gajim packages.
