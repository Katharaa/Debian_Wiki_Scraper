More information:

Agostino Sarubbo discovered multiple vulnerabilities in zziplib, a
library to access Zip archives, which could result in denial of service
and potentially the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed archive
is processed.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.13.62-3+deb8u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 0.13.62-3.1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.13.62-3.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your zziplib packages.
