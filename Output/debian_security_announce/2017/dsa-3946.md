Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 868956](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=868956), [Bug 871263](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=871263).

More information:

It was discovered that libsmpack, a library used to handle Microsoft
compression formats, did not properly validate its input. A remote
attacker could craft malicious CAB or CHM files and use this flaw to
cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially
execute arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.5-1+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libmspack packages.
