In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-2619](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2619).  

More information:

Jann Horn of Google discovered a time-of-check, time-of-use race
condition in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server for Unix. A
malicious client can take advantage of this flaw by exploiting a symlink
race to access areas of the server file system not exported under a
share definition.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:4.2.14+dfsg-0+deb8u4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:4.5.6+dfsg-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
