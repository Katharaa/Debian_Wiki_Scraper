Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 853249](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=853249).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-10173](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10173).  

More information:

Michal Marek discovered that ruby-archive-tar-minitar, a Ruby library
that provides the ability to deal with POSIX tar archive files, is prone
to a directory traversal vulnerability. An attacker can take advantage
of this flaw to overwrite arbitrary files during archive extraction via
a .. (dot dot) in an extracted filename.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.2-2+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-archive-tar-minitar packages.
