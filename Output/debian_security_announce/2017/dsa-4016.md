More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Irssi, a terminal based
IRC client. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:


* [CVE-2017-10965](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10965)
Brian geeknik Carpenter of Geeknik Labs discovered that Irssi does
 not properly handle receiving messages with invalid time stamps. A
 malicious IRC server can take advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi
 to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
* [CVE-2017-10966](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10966)
Brian geeknik Carpenter of Geeknik Labs discovered that Irssi is
 susceptible to a use-after-free flaw triggered while updating the
 internal nick list. A malicious IRC server can take advantage of
 this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
* [CVE-2017-15227](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15227)
Joseph Bisch discovered that while waiting for the channel
 synchronisation, Irssi may incorrectly fail to remove destroyed
 channels from the query list, resulting in use after free conditions
 when updating the state later on. A malicious IRC server can take
 advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a
 denial of service.
* [CVE-2017-15228](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15228)
Hanno Boeck reported that Irssi does not properly handle installing
 themes with unterminated colour formatting sequences, leading to a
 denial of service if a user is tricked into installing a specially
 crafted theme.
* [CVE-2017-15721](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15721)
Joseph Bisch discovered that Irssi does not properly handle
 incorrectly formatted DCC CTCP messages. A remote attacker can take
 advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a
 denial of service.
* [CVE-2017-15722](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15722)
Joseph Bisch discovered that Irssi does not properly verify Safe
 channel IDs. A malicious IRC server can take advantage of this flaw
 to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
* [CVE-2017-15723](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15723)
Joseph Bisch reported that Irssi does not properly handle overlong
 nicks or targets resulting in a NULL pointer dereference when
 splitting the message and leading to a denial of service.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.8.17-1+deb8u5.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2-1+deb9u3. [CVE-2017-10965](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10965) and [CVE-2017-10966](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10966) were already
fixed in an earlier point release.


We recommend that you upgrade your irssi packages.
