More information:

Wen Bin discovered that bchunk, an application that converts a CD
image in bin/cue format into a set of iso and cdr/wav tracks files,
did not properly check its input. This would allow malicious users to
crash the application or potentially execute arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.0-12+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.0-12+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your bchunk packages.
