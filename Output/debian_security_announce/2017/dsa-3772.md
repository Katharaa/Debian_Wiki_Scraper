Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3772-1 libxpm -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
26 Jan 2017
Affected Packages:

[libxpm](https://packages.debian.org/src:libxpm)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-10164](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10164).  

More information:

Tobias Stoeckmann discovered that the libXpm library contained two
integer overflow flaws, leading to a heap out-of-bounds write, while
parsing XPM extensions in a file. An attacker can provide a specially
crafted XPM file that, when processed by an application using the libXpm
library, would cause a denial-of-service against the application, or
potentially, the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.5.12-0+deb8u1. This update is based on a new upstream
version of libxpm including additional bug fixes.


For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1:3.5.12-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libxpm packages.
