---------------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[rabbitmq-server](https://packages.debian.org/src:rabbitmq-server)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 849849](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=849849).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-9877](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9877).  

More information:

It was discovered that RabbitMQ, an implementation of the AMQP
protocol, didn't correctly validate MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport)
connection authentication. This allowed anyone to login to an existing
user account without having to provide a password.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.5-1.1+deb8u1.


For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 3.6.6-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your rabbitmq-server packages.
