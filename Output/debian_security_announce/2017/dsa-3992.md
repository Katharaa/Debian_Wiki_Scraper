More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


* [CVE-2017-1000100](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000100)
Even Rouault reported that cURL does not properly handle long file
 names when doing an TFTP upload. A malicious HTTP(S) server can take
 advantage of this flaw by redirecting a client using the cURL
 library to a crafted TFTP URL and trick it to send private memory
 contents to a remote server over UDP.
* [CVE-2017-1000101](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000101)
Brian Carpenter and Yongji Ouyang reported that cURL contains a flaw
 in the globbing function that parses the numerical range, leading to
 an out-of-bounds read when parsing a specially crafted URL.
* [CVE-2017-1000254](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000254)
Max Dymond reported that cURL contains an out-of-bounds read flaw in
 the FTP PWD response parser. A malicious server can take advantage
 of this flaw to effectively prevent a client using the cURL library
 to work with it, causing a denial of service.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.38.0-4+deb8u6.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.52.1-5+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
