Affected Packages:

[heimdal](https://packages.debian.org/src:heimdal)

Vulnerable:

Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 868208](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=868208).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-11103](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11103).  

More information:

Jeffrey Altman, Viktor Dukhovni, and Nicolas Williams reported that
Heimdal, an implementation of Kerberos 5 that aims to be compatible with
MIT Kerberos, trusts metadata taken from the unauthenticated plaintext
(Ticket), rather than the authenticated and encrypted KDC response. A
man-in-the-middle attacker can use this flaw to impersonate services to
the client.


See <https://orpheus-lyre.info/> for details.
