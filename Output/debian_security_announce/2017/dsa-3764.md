Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-2120](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2120), [CVE-2016-7068](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7068), [CVE-2016-7072](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7072), [CVE-2016-7073](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7073), [CVE-2016-7074](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7074).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in pdns, an authoritative
DNS server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:


* [CVE-2016-2120](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2120)
Mathieu Lafon discovered that pdns does not properly validate
 records in zones. An authorized user can take advantage of this flaw
 to crash server by inserting a specially crafted record in a zone
 under their control and then sending a DNS query for that record.
* [CVE-2016-7068](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7068)
Florian Heinz and Martin Kluge reported that pdns parses all records
 present in a query regardless of whether they are needed or even
 legitimate, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause an
 abnormal CPU usage load on the pdns server, resulting in a partial
 denial of service if the system becomes overloaded.
* [CVE-2016-7072](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7072)
Mongo discovered that the webserver in pdns is susceptible to a
 denial-of-service vulnerability, allowing a remote, unauthenticated
 attacker to cause a denial of service by opening a large number of TCP
 connections to the web server.
* [CVE-2016-7073](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7073) /
 [CVE-2016-7074](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7074)
Mongo discovered that pdns does not sufficiently validate TSIG
 signatures, allowing an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to
 alter the content of an AXFR.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.4.1-4+deb8u7.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.
