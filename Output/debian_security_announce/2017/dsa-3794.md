-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
25 Feb 2017
Affected Packages:

[munin](https://packages.debian.org/src:munin)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 855705](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=855705).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-6188](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6188).  

More information:

Stevie Trujillo discovered a local file write vulnerability in munin, a
network-wide graphing framework, when CGI graphs are enabled. GET
parameters are not properly handled, allowing to inject options into
munin-cgi-graph and overwriting any file accessible by the user
running the cgi-process.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.25-1+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your munin packages.
