Affected Packages:

[git](https://packages.debian.org/src:git)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-1000117](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000117).  

More information:

Joern Schneeweisz discovered that git, a distributed revision control
system, did not correctly handle maliciously constructed ssh://
URLs. This allowed an attacker to run an arbitrary shell command, for
instance via git submodules.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u4.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.11.0-3+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.
