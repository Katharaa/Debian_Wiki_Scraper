More information:

Eric Sesterhenn, from X41 D-Sec GmbH, discovered several
vulnerabilities in tnef, a tool used to unpack MIME attachments of
type application/ms-tnef. Multiple heap overflows, type confusions
and out of bound reads and writes could be exploited by tricking a
user into opening a malicious attachment. This would result in denial
of service via application crash, or potential arbitrary code
execution.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.9-1+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your tnef packages.
