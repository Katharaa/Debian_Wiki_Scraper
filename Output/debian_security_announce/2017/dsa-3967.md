More information:

An authentication bypass vulnerability was discovered in mbed TLS, a
lightweight crypto and SSL/TLS library, when the authentication mode is
configured as optional. A remote attacker can take advantage of this
flaw to mount a man-in-the-middle attack and impersonate an intended
peer via an X.509 certificate chain with many intermediates.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-1+deb9u1.


For the testing distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.6.0-1.
