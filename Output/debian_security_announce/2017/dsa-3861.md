========================


DSA-3861-1 libtasn1-6 -- security update
----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 May 2017
Affected Packages:

[libtasn1-6](https://packages.debian.org/src:libtasn1-6)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 863186](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=863186).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-6891](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6891).  

More information:

Jakub Jirasek of Secunia Research discovered that libtasn1, a library
used to handle Abstract Syntax Notation One structures, did not
properly validate its input. This would allow an attacker to cause a
crash by denial-of-service, or potentially execute arbitrary code, by
tricking a user into processing a maliciously crafted assignments
file.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2-3+deb8u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-6 packages.
