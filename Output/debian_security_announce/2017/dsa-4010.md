Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 873088](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=873088).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-12976](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12976).  

More information:

It was discovered that git-annex, a tool to manage files with git
without checking their contents in, did not correctly handle
maliciously constructed ssh:// URLs. This allowed an attacker to run
an arbitrary shell command.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.20141125+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.20170101-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your git-annex packages.
