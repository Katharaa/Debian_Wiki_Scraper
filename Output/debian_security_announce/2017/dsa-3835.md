More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python
web development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2016-9013](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9013)
Marti Raudsepp reported that a user with a hardcoded password is
 created when running tests with an Oracle database.
* [CVE-2016-9014](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9014)
Aymeric Augustin discovered that Django does not properly validate
 the Host header against settings.ALLOWED\_HOSTS when the debug
 setting is enabled. A remote attacker can take advantage of this
 flaw to perform DNS rebinding attacks.
* [CVE-2017-7233](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7233)
It was discovered that is\_safe\_url() does not properly handle
 certain numeric URLs as safe. A remote attacker can take advantage
 of this flaw to perform XSS attacks or to use a Django server as an
 open redirect.
* [CVE-2017-7234](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7234)
Phithon from Chaitin Tech discovered an open redirect vulnerability
 in the django.views.static.serve() view. Note that this view is not
 intended for production use.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.11-1+deb8u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
