More information:

It was discovered a vulnerability in Pidgin, a multi-protocol instant

crash or, in some extreme cases, to remote code execution in the
client-side.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.11.0-0+deb8u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
