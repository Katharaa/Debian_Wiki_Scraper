More information:

Marcin Noga discovered two vulnerabilities in LibreOffice, which could
result in the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed PPT or DOC
document is opened.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.3.3-2+deb8u9.


These vulnerabilities were fixed in Libreoffice 5.0.2, so the version
in the stable distribution (stretch) is not affected.


We recommend that you upgrade your libreoffice packages.
