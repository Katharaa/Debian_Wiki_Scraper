More information:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library.


* [CVE-2017-8816](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8816)
Alex Nichols discovered a buffer overrun flaw in the NTLM authentication
 code which can be triggered on 32bit systems where an integer overflow
 might occur when calculating the size of a memory allocation.
* [CVE-2017-8817](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8817)
Fuzzing by the OSS-Fuzz project led to the discovery of a read out of
 bounds flaw in the FTP wildcard function in libcurl. A malicious server
 could redirect a libcurl-based client to an URL using a wildcard pattern,
 triggering the out-of-bound read.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.38.0-4+deb8u8.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.52.1-5+deb9u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
