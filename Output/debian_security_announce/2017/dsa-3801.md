More information:

It was discovered that ruby-zip, a Ruby module for reading and writing
zip files, is prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. An attacker
can take advantage of this flaw to overwrite arbitrary files during
archive extraction via a .. (dot dot) in an extracted filename.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.6-1+deb8u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.2.0-1.1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.0-1.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-zip packages.
