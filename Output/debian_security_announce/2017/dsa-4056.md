DSA-4056-1 nova -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Dec 2017
Affected Packages:

[nova](https://packages.debian.org/src:nova)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 882009](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=882009).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-16239](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16239).  

More information:

George Shuklin from servers.com discovered that Nova, a cloud
computing fabric controller, did not correctly enforce its image- or
hosts-filters. This allowed an authenticated user to bypass those
filters by simply rebuilding an instance.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:14.0.0-4+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your nova packages.
