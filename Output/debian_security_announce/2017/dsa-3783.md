More information:

Several issues have been discovered in PHP, a widely-used open source
general-purpose scripting language.


* [CVE-2016-10158](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10158)
Loading a TIFF or JPEG malicious file can lead to a Denial-of-Service
 attack when the EXIF header is being parsed.
* [CVE-2016-10159](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10159)
Loading a malicious phar archive can cause an extensive memory
 allocation, leading to a Denial-of-Service attack on 32 bit
 computers.
* [CVE-2016-10160](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10160)
An attacker might remotely execute arbitrary code using a malicious
 phar archive. This is the consequence of an off-by-one memory
 corruption.
* [CVE-2016-10161](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10161)
An attacker with control of the unserialize() function argument can
 cause an out-of-bounce read. This could lead to a Denial-of-Service
 attack or a remote code execution.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.6.30+dfsg-0+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
