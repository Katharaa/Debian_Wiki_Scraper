More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Ruby language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2017-0898](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0898)
aerodudrizzt reported a buffer underrun vulnerability in the sprintf
 method of the Kernel module resulting in heap memory corruption or
 information disclosure from the heap.
* [CVE-2017-0903](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0903)
Max Justicz reported that RubyGems is prone to an unsafe object
 deserialization vulnerability. When parsed by an application which
 processes gems, a specially crafted YAML formatted gem specification
 can lead to remote code execution.
* [CVE-2017-10784](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10784)
Yusuke Endoh discovered an escape sequence injection vulnerability
 in the Basic authentication of WEBrick. An attacker can take
 advantage of this flaw to inject malicious escape sequences to the
 WEBrick log and potentially execute control characters on the
 victim's terminal emulator when reading logs.
* [CVE-2017-14033](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14033)
asac reported a buffer underrun vulnerability in the OpenSSL
 extension. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
 cause the Ruby interpreter to crash leading to a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3.3-1+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby2.3 packages.
