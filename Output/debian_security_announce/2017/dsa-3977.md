Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3977-1 newsbeuter -- security update
----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Sep 2017
Affected Packages:

[newsbeuter](https://packages.debian.org/src:newsbeuter)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 876004](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=876004).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-14500](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14500).  

More information:

It was discovered that podbeuter, the podcast fetcher in newsbeuter, a
text-mode RSS feed reader, did not properly escape the name of the media
enclosure (the podcast file), allowing a remote attacker to run an
arbitrary shell command on the client machine. This is only exploitable
if the file is also played in podbeuter.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.8-2+deb8u2.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9-5+deb9u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9-7.


We recommend that you upgrade your newsbeuter packages.
