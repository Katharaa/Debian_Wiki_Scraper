More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Exim, a mail transport
agent. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following issues:


* [CVE-2017-16943](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16943)
A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in Exim's routines
 responsible for parsing mail headers. A remote attacker can take
 advantage of this flaw to cause Exim to crash, resulting in a denial
 of service, or potentially for remote code execution.
* [CVE-2017-16944](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16944)
It was discovered that Exim does not properly handle BDAT data
 headers allowing a remote attacker to cause Exim to crash, resulting
 in a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.89-2+deb9u2. Default installations disable advertising the
ESMTP CHUNKING extension and are not affected by these issues.


We recommend that you upgrade your exim4 packages.
