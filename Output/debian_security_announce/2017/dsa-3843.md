More information:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in tomcat8, a servlet and JSP
engine.


* [CVE-2017-5647](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5647)
Pipelined requests were processed incorrectly, which could result in
 some responses appearing to be sent for the wrong request.
* [CVE-2017-5648](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5648)
Some application listeners calls were issued against the wrong
 objects, allowing untrusted applications running under a
 SecurityManager to bypass that protection mechanism and access or
 modify information associated with other web applications.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.0.14-1+deb8u9.


For the upcoming stable (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions,
these problems have been fixed in version 8.5.11-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.
