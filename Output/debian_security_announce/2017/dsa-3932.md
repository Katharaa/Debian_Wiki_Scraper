----------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[subversion](https://packages.debian.org/src:subversion)

Vulnerable:

Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-8734](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8734), [CVE-2017-9800](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9800).  

More information:

Several problems were discovered in Subversion, a centralised version
control system.


* [CVE-2016-8734](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8734)
(jessie only)


Subversion's mod\_dontdothat server module and Subversion clients
 using http(s):// were vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack
 caused by exponential XML entity expansion.
* [CVE-2017-9800](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9800)
Joern Schneeweisz discovered that Subversion did not correctly
 handle maliciously constructed svn+ssh:// URLs. This allowed an
 attacker to run an arbitrary shell command, for instance via
 svn:externals properties or when using svnsync sync.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.8.10-6+deb8u5.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.5-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.
