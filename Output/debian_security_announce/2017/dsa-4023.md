Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 880530](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=880530).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-15566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15566).  

More information:

Ryan Day discovered that the Simple Linux Utility for Resource
Management (SLURM), a cluster resource management and job scheduling
system, does not properly handle SPANK environment variables, allowing a
user permitted to submit jobs to execute code as root during the Prolog
or Epilog. All systems using a Prolog or Epilog script are vulnerable,
regardless of whether SPANK plugins are in use.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 16.05.9-1+deb9u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 17.02.9-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your slurm-llnl packages.
