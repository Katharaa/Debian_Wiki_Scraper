Alvaro Munoz and Christian Schneider discovered that jython, an
implementation of the Python language seamlessly integrated with Java,
is prone to arbitrary code execution triggered when sending a serialized
function to the deserializer.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.5.3-3+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your jython packages.
