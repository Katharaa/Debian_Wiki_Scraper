========================


DSA-3763-1 pdns-recursor -- security update
-------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
13 Jan 2017
Affected Packages:

[pdns-recursor](https://packages.debian.org/src:pdns-recursor)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-7068](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7068).  

More information:

Florian Heinz and Martin Kluge reported that pdns-recursor, a recursive
DNS server, parses all records present in a query regardless of whether
they are needed or even legitimate, allowing a remote, unauthenticated
attacker to cause an abnormal CPU usage load on the pdns server,
resulting in a partial denial of service if the system becomes
overloaded.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.2-2+deb8u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your pdns-recursor packages.
