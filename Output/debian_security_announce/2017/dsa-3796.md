Affected Packages:

Vulnerable:

Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-0736](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0736), [CVE-2016-2161](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2161), [CVE-2016-8743](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8743).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Apache2 HTTP server.


* [CVE-2016-0736](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0736)
RedTeam Pentesting GmbH discovered that mod\_session\_crypto was
 vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, which could allow an attacker
 to guess the session cookie.
* [CVE-2016-2161](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2161)
Maksim Malyutin discovered that malicious input to mod\_auth\_digest
 could cause the server to crash, causing a denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-8743](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8743)
David Dennerline, of IBM Security's X-Force Researchers, and RÃ©gis
 Leroy discovered problems in the way Apache handled a broad pattern
 of unusual whitespace patterns in HTTP requests. In some
 configurations, this could lead to response splitting or cache
 pollution vulnerabilities. To fix these issues, this update makes
 Apache httpd be more strict in what HTTP requests it accepts.


If this causes problems with non-conforming clients, some checks can
 be relaxed by adding the new directive HttpProtocolOptions unsafe
 to the configuration.


This update also fixes the issue where mod\_reqtimeout was not enabled
by default on new installations.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.10-10+deb8u8.


For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 2.4.25-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
