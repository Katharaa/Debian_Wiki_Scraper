Affected Packages:

[ruby-mixlib-archive](https://packages.debian.org/src:ruby-mixlib-archive)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 868572](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=868572).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-1000026](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000026).  

More information:

It was discovered that ruby-mixlib-archive, a Chef Software's library
used to handle various archive formats, was vulnerable to a directory
traversal attack. This allowed attackers to overwrite arbitrary files
by using a malicious tar archive containing ".." in its entries.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.0-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-mixlib-archive packages.
