DSA-3758-1 bind9 -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
11 Jan 2017
Affected Packages:

[bind9](https://packages.debian.org/src:bind9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 851062](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=851062), [Bug 851063](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=851063), [Bug 851065](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=851065).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-9131](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9131), [CVE-2016-9147](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9147), [CVE-2016-9444](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9444).  

More information:

Several denial-of-service vulnerabilities (assertion failures) were
discovered in BIND, a DNS server implementation.


* [CVE-2016-9131](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9131)
A crafted upstream response to an ANY query could cause an
 assertion failure.
* [CVE-2016-9147](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9147)
A crafted upstream response with self-contradicting DNSSEC data
 could cause an assertion failure.
* [CVE-2016-9444](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9444)
Specially-crafted upstream responses with a DS record could cause
 an assertion failure.


These vulnerabilities predominantly affect DNS servers providing
recursive service. Client queries to authoritative-only servers
cannot trigger these assertion failures. These vulnerabilities are
present whether or not DNSSEC validation is enabled in the server
configuration.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u9.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
