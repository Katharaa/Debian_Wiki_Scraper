========================


DSA-3828-1 dovecot -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Apr 2017
Affected Packages:

[dovecot](https://packages.debian.org/src:dovecot)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 860049](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=860049).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-2669](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2669).  

More information:

It was discovered that the Dovecot email server is vulnerable to a
denial of service attack. When the dict passdb and userdb are used
for user authentication, the username sent by the IMAP/POP3 client is
sent through var\_expand() to perform %variable expansion. Sending
specially crafted %variable fields could result in excessive memory
usage causing the process to crash (and restart).


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.2.13-12~deb8u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your dovecot packages.
