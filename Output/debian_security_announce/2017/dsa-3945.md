More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2014-9940](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9940)
A use-after-free flaw in the voltage and current regulator driver
 could allow a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially
 escalate privileges.
* [CVE-2017-7346](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7346)
Li Qiang discovered that the DRM driver for VMware virtual GPUs does
 not properly check user-controlled values in the
 vmw\_surface\_define\_ioctl() functions for upper limits. A local user
 can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2017-7482](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7482)
Shi Lei discovered that RxRPC Kerberos 5 ticket handling code does
 not properly verify metadata, leading to information disclosure,
 denial of service or potentially execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2017-7533](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7533)
Fan Wu and Shixiong Zhao discovered a race condition between inotify
 events and VFS rename operations allowing an unprivileged local
 attacker to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges.
* [CVE-2017-7541](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7541)
A buffer overflow flaw in the Broadcom IEEE802.11n PCIe SoftMAC WLAN
 driver could allow a local user to cause kernel memory corruption,
 leading to a denial of service or potentially privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2017-7542](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7542)
An integer overflow vulnerability in the ip6\_find\_1stfragopt()
 function was found allowing a local attacker with privileges to open
 raw sockets to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2017-7889](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7889)
Tommi Rantala and Brad Spengler reported that the mm subsystem does
 not properly enforce the CONFIG\_STRICT\_DEVMEM protection mechanism,
 allowing a local attacker with access to /dev/mem to obtain
 sensitive information or potentially execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2017-9605](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9605)
Murray McAllister discovered that the DRM driver for VMware virtual
 GPUs does not properly initialize memory, potentially allowing a
 local attacker to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized
 kernel memory via a crafted ioctl call.
* [CVE-2017-10911](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10911)
/ XSA-216


Anthony Perard of Citrix discovered an information leak flaw in Xen
 blkif response handling, allowing a malicious unprivileged guest to
 obtain sensitive information from the host or other guests.
* [CVE-2017-11176](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11176)
It was discovered that the mq\_notify() function does not set the
 sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. An attacker
 can take advantage of this flaw during a userspace close of a
 Netlink socket to cause a denial of service or potentially cause
 other impact.
* [CVE-2017-1000363](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000363)
Roee Hay reported that the lp driver does not properly bounds-check
 passed arguments, allowing a local attacker with write access to the
 kernel command line arguments to execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2017-1000365](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000365)
It was discovered that argument and environment pointers are not
 taken properly into account to the imposed size restrictions on
 arguments and environmental strings passed through
 RLIMIT\_STACK/RLIMIT\_INFINITY. A local attacker can take advantage of
 this flaw in conjunction with other flaws to execute arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.43-2+deb8u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
