In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-7890](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7890).  

More information:

Matviy Kotoniy reported that the gdImageCreateFromGifCtx() function used
to load images from GIF format files in libgd2, a library for
programmatic graphics creation and manipulation, does not zero stack
allocated color map buffers before their use, which may result in
information disclosure if a specially crafted file is processed.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.1.0-5+deb8u10.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.4-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.
