Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-6786](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6786), [CVE-2016-6787](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6787), [CVE-2016-8405](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8405), [CVE-2016-9191](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9191), [CVE-2017-2583](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2583), [CVE-2017-2584](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2584), [CVE-2017-2596](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2596), [CVE-2017-2618](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2618), [CVE-2017-5549](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5549), [CVE-2017-5551](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5551), [CVE-2017-5897](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5897), [CVE-2017-5970](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5970), [CVE-2017-6001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6001), [CVE-2017-6074](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6074).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or have other
impacts.


* [CVE-2016-6786](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6786) / [CVE-2016-6787](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6787)
It was discovered that the performance events subsystem does not
 properly manage locks during certain migrations, allowing a local
 attacker to escalate privileges. This can be mitigated by
 disabling unprivileged use of performance events:
 `sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3`
* [CVE-2016-8405](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8405)
Peter Pi of Trend Micro discovered that the frame buffer video
 subsystem does not properly check bounds while copying color maps to
 userspace, causing a heap buffer out-of-bounds read, leading to
 information disclosure.
* [CVE-2016-9191](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9191)
CAI Qian discovered that reference counting is not properly handled
 within proc\_sys\_readdir in the sysctl implementation, allowing a
 local denial of service (system hang) or possibly privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2017-2583](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2583)
Xiaohan Zhang reported that KVM for amd64 does not correctly
 emulate loading of a null stack selector. This can be used by a
 user in a guest VM for denial of service (on an Intel CPU) or to
 escalate privileges within the VM (on an AMD CPU).
* [CVE-2017-2584](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2584)
Dmitry Vyukov reported that KVM for x86 does not correctly emulate
 memory access by the SGDT and SIDT instructions, which can result
 in a use-after-free and information leak.
* [CVE-2017-2596](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2596)
Dmitry Vyukov reported that KVM leaks page references when
 emulating a VMON for a nested hypervisor. This can be used by a
 privileged user in a guest VM for denial of service or possibly
 to gain privileges in the host.
* [CVE-2017-2618](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2618)
It was discovered that an off-by-one in the handling of SELinux
 attributes in /proc/pid/attr could result in local denial of
 service.
* [CVE-2017-5549](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5549)
It was discovered that the KLSI KL5KUSB105 serial USB device
 driver could log the contents of uninitialised kernel memory,
 resulting in an information leak.
* [CVE-2017-5551](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5551)
Jan Kara found that changing the POSIX ACL of a file on tmpfs never
 cleared its set-group-ID flag, which should be done if the user
 changing it is not a member of the group-owner. In some cases, this
 would allow the user-owner of an executable to gain the privileges
 of the group-owner.
* [CVE-2017-5897](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5897)
Andrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds read flaw in the
 ip6gre\_err function in the IPv6 networking code.
* [CVE-2017-5970](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5970)
Andrey Konovalov discovered a denial-of-service flaw in the IPv4
 networking code. This can be triggered by a local or remote
 attacker if a local UDP or raw socket has the IP\_RETOPTS option
 enabled.
* [CVE-2017-6001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6001)
Di Shen discovered a race condition between concurrent calls to
 the performance events subsystem, allowing a local attacker to
 escalate privileges. This flaw exists because of an incomplete fix
 of [CVE-2016-6786](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6786).
 This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged use of performance
 events: `sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3`
* [CVE-2017-6074](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6074)
Andrey Konovalov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the
 DCCP networking code, which could result in denial of service or
 local privilege escalation. On systems that do not already have
 the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling it:
 `echo>> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf install dccp false`


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.39-1+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
