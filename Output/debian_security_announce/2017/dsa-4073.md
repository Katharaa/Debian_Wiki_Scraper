More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2017-8824](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8824)
Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the DCCP implementation did not
 correctly manage resources when a socket is disconnected and
 reconnected, potentially leading to a use-after-free. A local
 user could use this for denial of service (crash or data
 corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. On systems that
 do not already have the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated
 by disabling it:
 `echo>> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf install dccp false`
* [CVE-2017-16538](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16538)
Andrey Konovalov reported that the dvb-usb-lmedm04 media driver
 did not correctly handle some error conditions during
 initialisation. A physically present user with a specially
 designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of service
 (crash).
* [CVE-2017-16644](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16644)
Andrey Konovalov reported that the hdpvr media driver did not
 correctly handle some error conditions during initialisation. A
 physically present user with a specially designed USB device can
 use this to cause a denial of service (crash).
* [CVE-2017-16995](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16995)
Jann Horn discovered that the Extended BPF verifier did not
 correctly model the behaviour of 32-bit load instructions. A
 local user can use this for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2017-17448](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17448)
Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netfilter subsystem allowed
 users with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability in any user namespace, not
 just the root namespace, to enable and disable connection tracking
 helpers. This could lead to denial of service, violation of
 network security policy, or have other impact.
* [CVE-2017-17449](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17449)
Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netlink subsystem allowed
 users with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability in any user namespace
 to monitor netlink traffic in all net namespaces, not just
 those owned by that user namespace. This could lead to
 exposure of sensitive information.
* [CVE-2017-17450](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17450)
Kevin Cernekee discovered that the xt\_osf module allowed users
 with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability in any user namespace to modify
 the global OS fingerprint list.
* [CVE-2017-17558](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17558)
Andrey Konovalov reported that that USB core did not correctly
 handle some error conditions during initialisation. A physically
 present user with a specially designed USB device can use this to
 cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption), or
 possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2017-17712](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17712)
Mohamed Ghannam discovered a race condition in the IPv4 raw socket
 implementation. A local user could use this to obtain sensitive
 information from the kernel.
* [CVE-2017-17741](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17741)
Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for x86 would
 over-read data from memory when emulating an MMIO write if the
 kvm\_mmio tracepoint was enabled. A guest virtual machine might be
 able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).
* [CVE-2017-17805](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17805)
It was discovered that some implementations of the Salsa20 block
 cipher did not correctly handle zero-length input. A local user
 could use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly
 have other security impact.
* [CVE-2017-17806](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17806)
It was discovered that the HMAC implementation could be used with
 an underlying hash algorithm that requires a key, which was not
 intended. A local user could use this to cause a denial of
 service (crash or memory corruption), or possibly for privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2017-17807](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17807)
Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem lacked a check for
 write permission when adding keys to a process's default keyring.
 A local user could use this to cause a denial of service or to
 obtain sensitive information.
* [CVE-2017-17862](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17862)
Alexei Starovoitov discovered that the Extended BPF verifier
 ignored unreachable code, even though it would still be processed
 by JIT compilers. This could possibly be used by local users for
 denial of service. It also increases the severity of bugs in
 determining unreachable code.
* [CVE-2017-17863](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17863)
Jann Horn discovered that the Extended BPF verifier did not
 correctly model pointer arithmetic on the stack frame pointer.
 A local user can use this for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2017-17864](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17864)
Jann Horn discovered that the Extended BPF verifier could fail to
 detect pointer leaks from conditional code. A local user could
 use this to obtain sensitive information in order to exploit
 other vulnerabilities.
* [CVE-2017-1000407](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000407)
Andrew Honig reported that the KVM implementation for Intel
 processors allowed direct access to host I/O port 0x80, which
 is not generally safe. On some systems this allows a guest
 VM to cause a denial of service (crash) of the host.
* [CVE-2017-1000410](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000410)
Ben Seri reported that the Bluetooth subsystem did not correctly
 handle short EFS information elements in L2CAP messages. An
 attacker able to communicate over Bluetooth could use this to
 obtain sensitive information from the kernel.


The various problems in the Extended BPF verifier can be mitigated by
disabling use of Extended BPF by unprivileged users:
`sysctl kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1`


Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, but if they
are enabled (via the `kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone` sysctl) then
[CVE-2017-17448](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17448) can be exploited by any local user.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.65-3+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
