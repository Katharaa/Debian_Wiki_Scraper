More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2017-7518](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7518)
Andy Lutomirski discovered that KVM is prone to an incorrect debug
 exception (#DB) error occurring while emulating a syscall
 instruction. A process inside a guest can take advantage of this
 flaw for privilege escalation inside a guest.
* [CVE-2017-7558](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7558)
 (stretch only)
 Stefano Brivio of Red Hat discovered that the SCTP subsystem is
 prone to a data leak vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds read
 flaw, allowing to leak up to 100 uninitialized bytes to userspace.
* [CVE-2017-10661](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10661)
 (jessie only)
 Dmitry Vyukov of Google reported that the timerfd facility does
 not properly handle certain concurrent operations on a single file
 descriptor. This allows a local attacker to cause a denial of
 service or potentially execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2017-11600](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11600)
Bo Zhang reported that the xfrm subsystem does not properly
 validate one of the parameters to a netlink message. Local users
 with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability can use this to cause a denial
 of service or potentially to execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2017-12134](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12134)
 / #866511 / XSA-229
 Jan H. Schoenherr of Amazon discovered that when Linux is running
 in a Xen PV domain on an x86 system, it may incorrectly merge
 block I/O requests. A buggy or malicious guest may trigger this
 bug in dom0 or a PV driver domain, causing a denial of service or
 potentially execution of arbitrary code.


This issue can be mitigated by disabling merges on the underlying
 back-end block devices, e.g.:
 `echo 2> /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/nomerges`
* [CVE-2017-12146](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12146)
 (stretch only)
 Adrian Salido of Google reported a race condition in access to the
 driver\_override attribute for platform devices in sysfs. If
 unprivileged users are permitted to access this attribute, this
 might allow them to gain privileges.
* [CVE-2017-12153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12153)
Bo Zhang reported that the cfg80211 (wifi) subsystem does not
 properly validate the parameters to a netlink message. Local users
 with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace with a
 wifi device) can use this to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2017-12154](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12154)
Jim Mattson of Google reported that the KVM implementation for
 Intel x86 processors did not correctly handle certain nested
 hypervisor configurations. A malicious guest (or nested guest in a
 suitable L1 hypervisor) could use this for denial of service.
* [CVE-2017-14106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14106)
Andrey Konovalov discovered that a user-triggerable division by
 zero in the tcp\_disconnect() function could result in local denial
 of service.
* [CVE-2017-14140](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14140)
Otto Ebeling reported that the move\_pages() system call performed
 insufficient validation of the UIDs of the calling and target
 processes, resulting in a partial ASLR bypass. This made it easier
 for local users to exploit vulnerabilities in programs installed
 with the set-UID permission bit set.
* [CVE-2017-14156](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14156)
sohu0106 reported an information leak in the atyfb video driver.
 A local user with access to a framebuffer device handled by this
 driver could use this to obtain sensitive information.
* [CVE-2017-14340](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14340)
Richard Wareing discovered that the XFS implementation allows the
 creation of files with the realtime flag on a filesystem with no
 realtime device, which can result in a crash (oops). A local user
 with access to an XFS filesystem that does not have a realtime
 device can use this for denial of service.
* [CVE-2017-14489](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14489)
ChunYu Wang of Red Hat discovered that the iSCSI subsystem does not
 properly validate the length of a netlink message, leading to
 memory corruption. A local user with permission to manage iSCSI
 devices can use this for denial of service or possibly to execute
 arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2017-14497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14497)
 (stretch only)
 Benjamin Poirier of SUSE reported that vnet headers are not
 properly handled within the tpacket\_rcv() function in the raw
 packet (af\_packet) feature. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_RAW
 capability can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of
 service (buffer overflow, and disk and memory corruption) or have
 other impact.
* [CVE-2017-1000111](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000111)
Andrey Konovalov of Google reported a race condition in the raw
 packet (af\_packet) feature. Local users with the CAP\_NET\_RAW
 capability can use this for denial of service or possibly to
 execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2017-1000112](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000112)
Andrey Konovalov of Google reported a race condition flaw in the
 UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) code. A local user can use this
 flaw for denial of service or possibly to execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2017-1000251](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000251)
 / #875881
 Armis Labs discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem does not
 properly validate L2CAP configuration responses, leading to a
 stack buffer overflow. This is one of several vulnerabilities
 dubbed Blueborne. A nearby attacker can use this to cause a
 denial of service or possibly to execute arbitrary code on a
 system with Bluetooth enabled.
* [CVE-2017-1000252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000252)
 (stretch only)
 Jan H. Schoenherr of Amazon reported that the KVM implementation
 for Intel x86 processors did not correctly validate interrupt
 injection requests. A local user with permission to use KVM could
 use this for denial of service.
* [CVE-2017-1000370](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000370)
The Qualys Research Labs reported that a large argument or
 environment list can result in ASLR bypass for 32-bit PIE binaries.
* [CVE-2017-1000371](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000371)
The Qualys Research Labs reported that a large argument
 or environment list can result in a stack/heap clash for 32-bit
 PIE binaries.
* [CVE-2017-1000380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000380)
Alexander Potapenko of Google reported a race condition in the ALSA
 (sound) timer driver, leading to an information leak. A local user
 with permission to access sound devices could use this to obtain
 sensitive information.


Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, but if they
are enabled (via the kernel.unprivileged\_userns\_clone sysctl) then
[CVE-2017-11600](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11600),
[CVE-2017-14497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14497) and
[CVE-2017-1000111](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000111)
can be exploited by any local user.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.43-2+deb8u5.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.30-2+deb9u5.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
