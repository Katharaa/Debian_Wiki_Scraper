Affected Packages:

[nss](https://packages.debian.org/src:nss)

Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-7805](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7805).  

More information:

Martin Thomson discovered that nss, the Mozilla Network Security Service
library, is prone to a use-after-free vulnerability in the TLS 1.2
implementation when handshake hashes are generated. A remote attacker
can take advantage of this flaw to cause an application using the nss
library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially to
execute arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2:3.26-1+debu8u3.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.26.2-1.1+deb9u1.


For the testing distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 2:3.33-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.33-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.
