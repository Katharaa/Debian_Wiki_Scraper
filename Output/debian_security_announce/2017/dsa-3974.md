More information:

Two issues were discovered in the Tomcat servlet and JSP engine.


* [CVE-2017-7674](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7674)
Rick Riemer discovered that the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
 filter did not add a Vary header indicating possible different
 responses, which could lead to cache poisoning.
* [CVE-2017-7675](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7675) (stretch only)
 Markus DÃ¶rschmidt found that the HTTP/2 implementation bypassed
 some security checks, thus allowing an attacker to conduct
 directory traversal attacks by using specially crafted URLs.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 8.0.14-1+deb8u11.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.5.14-1+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.
