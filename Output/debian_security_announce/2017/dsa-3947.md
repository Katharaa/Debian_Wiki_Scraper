Jeriko One discovered that newsbeuter, a text-mode RSS feed reader,
did not properly escape the title and description of a news article
when bookmarking it. This allowed a remote attacker to run an
arbitrary shell command on the client machine.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.8-2+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9-5+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your newsbeuter packages.
