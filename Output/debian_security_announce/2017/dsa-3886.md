More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2017-7487](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7487)
Li Qiang reported a reference counter leak in the ipxitf\_ioctl
 function which may result into a use-after-free vulnerability,
 triggerable when a IPX interface is configured.
* [CVE-2017-7645](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7645)
Tuomas Haanpaa and Matti Kamunen from Synopsys Ltd discovered that
 the NFSv2 and NFSv3 server implementations are vulnerable to an
 out-of-bounds memory access issue while processing arbitrarily long
 arguments sent by NFSv2/NFSv3 PRC clients, leading to a denial of
 service.
* [CVE-2017-7895](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7895)
Ari Kauppi from Synopsys Ltd discovered that the NFSv2 and NFSv3
 server implementations do not properly handle payload bounds
 checking of WRITE requests. A remote attacker with write access to a
 NFS mount can take advantage of this flaw to read chunks of
 arbitrary memory from both kernel-space and user-space.
* [CVE-2017-8064](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8064)
Arnd Bergmann found that the DVB-USB core misused the device
 logging system, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability, with
 unknown security impact.
* [CVE-2017-8890](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8890)
It was discovered that the net\_csk\_clone\_lock() function allows a
 remote attacker to cause a double free leading to a denial of
 service or potentially have other impact.
* [CVE-2017-8924](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8924)
Johan Hovold found that the io\_ti USB serial driver could leak
 sensitive information if a malicious USB device was connected.
* [CVE-2017-8925](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8925)
Johan Hovold found a reference counter leak in the omninet USB
 serial driver, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. This
 can be triggered by a local user permitted to open tty devices.
* [CVE-2017-9074](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9074)
Andrey Konovalov reported that the IPv6 fragmentation
 implementation could read beyond the end of a packet buffer. A
 local user or guest VM might be able to use this to leak sensitive
 information or to cause a denial of service (crash).
* [CVE-2017-9075](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9075)
Andrey Konovalov reported that the SCTP/IPv6 implementation
 wrongly initialised address lists on connected sockets, resulting
 in a use-after-free vulnerability, a similar issue to
 [CVE-2017-8890](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8890). This can be triggered by any local user.
* [CVE-2017-9076](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9076)
 / [CVE-2017-9077](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9077)
Cong Wang found that the TCP/IPv6 and DCCP/IPv6 implementations
 wrongly initialised address lists on connected sockets, a similar
 issue to [CVE-2017-9075](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9075).
* [CVE-2017-9242](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9242)
Andrey Konovalov reported a packet buffer overrun in the IPv6
 implementation. A local user could use this for denial of service
 (memory corruption; crash) and possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2017-1000364](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000364)
The Qualys Research Labs discovered that the size of the stack guard
 page is not sufficiently large. The stack-pointer can jump over the
 guard-page and moving from the stack into another memory region
 without accessing the guard-page. In this case no page-fault
 exception is raised and the stack extends into the other memory
 region. An attacker can exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.


The default stack gap protection is set to 256 pages and can be
 configured via the stack\_guard\_gap kernel parameter on the kernel
 command line.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.43-2+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.30-2+deb9u1 or earlier versions before the stretch release.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
