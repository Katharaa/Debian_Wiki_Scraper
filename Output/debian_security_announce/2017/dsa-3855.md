More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in the JBIG2 decoder library,
which may lead to denial of service, disclosure of sensitive information
from process memory or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed
image file (usually embedded in a PDF document) is opened.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.13-4~deb8u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.13-4.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your jbig2dec packages.
