Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-4001-1 yadifa -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
19 Oct 2017
Affected Packages:

[yadifa](https://packages.debian.org/src:yadifa)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 876315](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=876315).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-14339](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14339).  

More information:

It was discovered that YADIFA, an authoritative DNS server, did not
sufficiently check its input. This allowed a remote attacker to cause
a denial-of-service by forcing the daemon to enter an infinite loop.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.3-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your yadifa packages.
