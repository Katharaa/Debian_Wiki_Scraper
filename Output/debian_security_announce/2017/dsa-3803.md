DSA-3803-1 texlive-base -- security update
------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
08 Mar 2017
Affected Packages:

[texlive-base](https://packages.debian.org/src:texlive-base)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-10243](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10243).  

More information:

It was discovered that texlive-base, the TeX Live package which provides
the essential TeX programs and files, whitelists mpost as an external
program to be run from within the TeX source code (called \write18).
Since mpost allows to specify other programs to be run, an attacker can
take advantage of this flaw for arbitrary code execution when compiling
a TeX document.
