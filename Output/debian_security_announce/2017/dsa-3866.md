----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 May 2017
Affected Packages:

[strongswan](https://packages.debian.org/src:strongswan)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-9022](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9022), [CVE-2017-9023](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9023).  

More information:

Two denial of service vulnerabilities were identified in strongSwan, an
IKE/IPsec suite, using Google's OSS-Fuzz fuzzing project.


* [CVE-2017-9022](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9022)
RSA public keys passed to the gmp plugin aren't validated sufficiently
 before attempting signature verification, so that invalid input might
 lead to a floating point exception and crash of the process.
 A certificate with an appropriately prepared public key sent by a peer
 could be used for a denial-of-service attack.
* [CVE-2017-9023](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9023)
ASN.1 CHOICE types are not correctly handled by the ASN.1 parser when
 parsing X.509 certificates with extensions that use such types. This could
 lead to infinite looping of the thread parsing a specifically crafted
 certificate.


A fix for a build failure was additionally included in the 5.2.1-6+deb8u4
revision of the strongSwan package.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.2.1-6+deb8u3.


For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 5.5.1-4


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.1-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.
