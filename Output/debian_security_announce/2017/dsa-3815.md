More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They would allow remote attackers to delete unintended files,
mount Cross-Site Scripting attacks, or bypass redirect URL validation
mechanisms.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1+dfsg-1+deb8u13.


For the upcoming stable (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions,
these problems have been fixed in version 4.7.3+dfsg-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.
