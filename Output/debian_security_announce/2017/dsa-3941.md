Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-11721](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11721).  

More information:

A read buffer overflow was discovered in the idtech3 (Quake III Arena)
family of game engines. This allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
