========================


DSA-3795-1 bind9 -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
26 Feb 2017
Affected Packages:

[bind9](https://packages.debian.org/src:bind9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 855520](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=855520).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-3135](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3135).  

More information:

It was discovered that a maliciously crafted query can cause ISC's
BIND DNS server (named) to crash if both Response Policy Zones (RPZ)
and DNS64 (a bridge between IPv4 and IPv6 networks) are enabled. It
is uncommon for both of these options to be used in combination, so
very few systems will be affected by this problem in practice.


This update also corrects an additional regression caused by the fix
for [CVE-2016-8864](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8864),
which was applied in a previous security update.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u10.


For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-12.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
