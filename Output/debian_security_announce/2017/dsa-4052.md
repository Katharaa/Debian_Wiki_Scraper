Adam Collard discovered that Bazaar, an easy to use distributed version
control system, did not correctly handle maliciously constructed bzr+ssh
URLs, allowing a remote attacker to run an arbitrary shell command.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.6.0+bzr6595-6+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
