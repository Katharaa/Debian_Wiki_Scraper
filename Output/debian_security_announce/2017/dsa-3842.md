* [CVE-2017-5647](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5647)
Pipelined requests were processed incorrectly, which could result in
 some responses appearing to be sent for the wrong request.
* [CVE-2017-5648](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5648)
Some application listeners calls were issued against the wrong

 modify information associated with other web applications.
