Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 858641](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=858641).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-6369](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6369).  

More information:

George Noseevich discovered that firebird2.5, a relational database
system, did not properly check User-Defined Functions (UDF), thus
allowing remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code on the
firebird server.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.3.26778.ds4-5+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your firebird2.5 packages.
