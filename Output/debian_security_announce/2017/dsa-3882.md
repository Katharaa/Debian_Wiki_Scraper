More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Request Tracker, an
extensible trouble-ticket tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2016-6127](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6127)
It was discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to a cross-site
 scripting (XSS) attack if an attacker uploads a malicious file with
 a certain content type. Installations which use the
 AlwaysDownloadAttachments config setting are unaffected by this
 flaw. The applied fix addresses all existant and future uploaded
 attachments.
* [CVE-2017-5361](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5361)
It was discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to timing
 side-channel attacks for user passwords.
* [CVE-2017-5943](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5943)
It was discovered that Request Tracker is prone to an information
 leak of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) verification tokens if a
 user is tricked into visiting a specially crafted URL by an
 attacker.
* [CVE-2017-5944](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5944)
It was discovered that Request Tracker is prone to a remote code
 execution vulnerability in the dashboard subscription interface. A
 privileged attacker can take advantage of this flaw through
 carefully-crafted saved search names to cause unexpected code to be
 executed. The applied fix addresses all existant and future saved
 searches.


Additionally to the above mentioned CVEs, this update workarounds
[CVE-2015-7686](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7686)
in Email::Address which could induce a denial of service
of Request Tracker itself.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.8-3+deb8u2.


For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.4.1-3+deb9u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.1-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker4 packages.
