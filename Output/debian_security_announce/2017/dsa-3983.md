More information:

Multiple security issues have been discoverd in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix:


* [CVE-2017-12150](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12150)
Stefan Metzmacher discovered multiple code paths where SMB signing
 was not enforced.
* [CVE-2017-12151](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12151)
Stefan Metzmacher discovered that tools using libsmbclient did not
 enforce encryption when following DFS redirects, which could allow a
 man-in-the-middle attacker to read or modify connections which were
 meant to be encrypted.
* [CVE-2017-12163](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12163)
Yihan Lian and Zhibin Hu discovered that insufficient range checks
 in the processing of SMB1 write requests could result in disclosure
 of server memory.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:4.2.14+dfsg-0+deb8u8.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.5.8+dfsg-2+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
