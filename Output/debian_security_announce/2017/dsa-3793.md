More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the shadow suite. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2016-6252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6252)
An integer overflow vulnerability was discovered, potentially
 allowing a local user to escalate privileges via crafted input to
 the newuidmap utility.
* [CVE-2017-2616](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2616)
Tobias Stoeckmann discovered that su does not properly handle
 clearing a child PID. A local attacker can take advantage of this
 flaw to send SIGKILL to other processes with root privileges,
 resulting in denial of service.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2-3+deb8u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your shadow packages.
