More information:

It was discovered that CVS, a centralised version control system, did
not correctly handle maliciously constructed repository URLs, which
allowed an attacker to run an arbitrary shell command.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2:1.12.13+real-15+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.12.13+real-22+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your cvs packages.
