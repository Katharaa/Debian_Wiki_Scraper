More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in kde4libs, the core libraries
for all KDE 4 applications. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2017-6410](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6410)
Itzik Kotler, Yonatan Fridburg and Amit Klein of Safebreach Labs
 reported that URLs are not sanitized before passing them to
 FindProxyForURL, potentially allowing a remote attacker to obtain
 sensitive information via a crafted PAC file.
* [CVE-2017-8422](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8422)
Sebastian Krahmer from SUSE discovered that the KAuth framework
 contains a logic flaw in which the service invoking dbus is not
 properly checked. This flaw allows spoofing the identity of the
 caller and gaining root privileges from an unprivileged account.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:4.14.2-5+deb8u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:4.14.26-2.
