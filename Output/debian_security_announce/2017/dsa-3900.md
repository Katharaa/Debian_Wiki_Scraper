More information:

Several issues were discovered in openvpn, a virtual private network
application.


* [CVE-2017-7479](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7479)
It was discovered that openvpn did not properly handle the
 rollover of packet identifiers. This would allow an authenticated
 remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service via application
 crash.
* [CVE-2017-7508](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7508)
Guido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle
 specific malformed IPv6 packets. This would allow a remote
 attacker to cause a denial-of-service via application crash.
* [CVE-2017-7520](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7520)
Guido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle
 clients connecting to an HTTP proxy with NTLMv2
 authentication. This would allow a remote attacker to cause a
 denial-of-service via application crash, or potentially leak
 sensitive information like the user's proxy password.
* [CVE-2017-7521](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7521)
Guido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle
 some x509 extensions. This would allow a remote attacker to cause
 a denial-of-service via application crash.
