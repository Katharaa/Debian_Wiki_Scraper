========================


DSA-3759-1 python-pysaml2 -- security update
--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
12 Jan 2017
Affected Packages:

[python-pysaml2](https://packages.debian.org/src:python-pysaml2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 850716](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=850716).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-10149](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-10149).  

More information:

Matias P. Brutti discovered that python-pysaml2, a Python
implementation of the Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0, did not
correctly sanitize the XML messages it handled. This allowed a remote
attacker to perform XML External Entity attacks, leading to a wide
range of exploits.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.0-1+deb8u1.


For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 3.0.0-5.


We recommend that you upgrade your python-pysaml2 packages.
