----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Aug 2017
Affected Packages:

[libsoup2.4](https://packages.debian.org/src:libsoup2.4)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 871650](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=871650).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-2885](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2885).  

More information:

Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos discovered a stack-based buffer
overflow vulnerability in libsoup2.4, a HTTP library implementation in
C. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw by sending a
specially crafted HTTP request to cause an application using the
libsoup2.4 library to crash (denial of service), or potentially execute
arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.48.0-1+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.56.0-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libsoup2.4 packages.
