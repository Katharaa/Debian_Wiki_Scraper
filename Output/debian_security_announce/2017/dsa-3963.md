 (fixed in stretch only)
 Jonathan Claudius of Mozilla discovered that repositories served
 over stdio could be tricked into granting authorized users access to
 the Python debugger.
* [CVE-2017-1000115](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000115)
Mercurial's symlink auditing was incomplete, and could be abused to
 write files outside the repository.

Joern Schneeweisz discovered that Mercurial did not correctly handle

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0-1+deb9u1.
