More information:

Hossein Lotfi and Jakub Jirasek from Secunia Research have discovered
multiple vulnerabilities in LibRaw, a library for reading RAW images. An
attacker could cause a memory corruption leading to a DoS (Denial of
Service) with craft KDC or TIFF file.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.16.0-9+deb8u3.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.17.2-6+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libraw packages.
