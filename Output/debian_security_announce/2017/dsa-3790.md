More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in spice, a SPICE protocol
client and server library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2016-9577](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9577)
Frediano Ziglio of Red Hat discovered a buffer overflow
 vulnerability in the main\_channel\_alloc\_msg\_rcv\_buf function. An
 authenticated attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
 denial of service (spice server crash), or possibly, execute
 arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2016-9578](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9578)
Frediano Ziglio of Red Hat discovered that spice does not properly
 validate incoming messages. An attacker able to connect to the
 spice server could send crafted messages which would cause the
 process to crash.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.5-1+deb8u4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.8-2.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your spice packages.
