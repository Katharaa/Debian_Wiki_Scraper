DSA-4055-1 heimdal -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Dec 2017
Affected Packages:

[heimdal](https://packages.debian.org/src:heimdal)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 878144](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=878144).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-17439](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17439).  

More information:

Michael Eder and Thomas Kittel discovered that Heimdal, an
implementation of Kerberos 5 that aims to be compatible with MIT
Kerberos, did not correctly handle ASN.1 data. This would allow an
unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (crash of
the KDC daemon) by sending maliciously crafted packets.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.1.0+dfsg-13+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages.
