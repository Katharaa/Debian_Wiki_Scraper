More information:

ClÃ©ment Berthaux from Synaktiv discovered two vulnerabilities in BIND, a DNS
server implementation. They allow an attacker to bypass TSIG authentication by
sending crafted DNS packets to a server.


* [CVE-2017-3142](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3142)
An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative
 DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name may be able to
 circumvent TSIG authentication of AXFR requests via a carefully constructed
 request packet. A server that relies solely on TSIG keys for protection
 with no other ACL protection could be manipulated into:
 


	+ providing an AXFR of a zone to an unauthorized recipient
	+ accepting bogus NOTIFY packets
* [CVE-2017-3143](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3143)
An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative
 DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name for the zone and
 service being targeted may be able to manipulate BIND into accepting an
 unauthorized dynamic update.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u12.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-12.3+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
