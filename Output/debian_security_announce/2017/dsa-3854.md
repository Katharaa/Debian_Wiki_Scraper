More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server
implementation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2017-3136](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3136)
Oleg Gorokhov of Yandex discovered that BIND does not properly
 handle certain queries when using DNS64 with the "break-dnssec yes;"
 option, allowing a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service.
* [CVE-2017-3137](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3137)
It was discovered that BIND makes incorrect assumptions about the
 ordering of records in the answer section of a response containing
 CNAME or DNAME resource records, leading to situations where BIND
 exits with an assertion failure. An attacker can take advantage of
 this condition to cause a denial-of-service.
* [CVE-2017-3138](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3138)
Mike Lalumiere of Dyn, Inc. discovered that BIND can exit with a
 REQUIRE assertion failure if it receives a null command string on
 its control channel. Note that the fix applied in Debian is only
 applied as a hardening measure. Details about the issue can be found
 at <https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01471> .


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u11.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-12.3.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
