Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3830-1 icu -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
19 Apr 2017
Affected Packages:

[icu](https://packages.debian.org/src:icu)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 860314](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=860314).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-7867](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7867), [CVE-2017-7868](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7868).  

More information:

It was discovered that icu, the International Components for Unicode
library, did not correctly validate its input. An attacker could use
this problem to trigger an out-of-bound write through a heap-based
buffer overflow, thus causing a denial of service via application
crash, or potential execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.1-8+deb8u5.


For the upcoming stable (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions,
these problems have been fixed in version 57.1-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your icu packages.
