Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 850007](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=850007), [Bug 850008](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=850008).

More information:

It was discovered that libvncserver, a collection of libraries used to
implement VNC/RFB clients and servers, incorrectly processed incoming
network packets. This resulted in several heap-based buffer overflows,
allowing a rogue server to either cause a DoS by crashing the client,
or potentially execute arbitrary code on the client side.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.9+dfsg2-6.1+deb8u2.


For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 0.9.11+dfsg-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libvncserver packages.
