Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-9588](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9588), [CVE-2017-2636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2636), [CVE-2017-5669](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5669), [CVE-2017-5986](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5986), [CVE-2017-6214](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6214), [CVE-2017-6345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6345), [CVE-2017-6346](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6346), [CVE-2017-6348](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6348), [CVE-2017-6353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6353).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or have other
impacts.


* [CVE-2016-9588](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9588)
Jim Mattson discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel x86
 processors does not properly handle #BP and #OF exceptions in an
 L2 (nested) virtual machine. A local attacker in an L2 guest VM
 can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service for
 the L1 guest VM.
* [CVE-2017-2636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2636)
Alexander Popov discovered a race condition flaw in the n\_hdlc
 line discipline that can lead to a double free. A local
 unprivileged user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege
 escalation. On systems that do not already have the n\_hdlc module
 loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling it:
 `echo>> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-n_hdlc.conf install n_hdlc false`
* [CVE-2017-5669](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5669)
Gareth Evans reported that privileged users can map memory at
 address 0 through the shmat() system call. This could make it
 easier to exploit other kernel security vulnerabilities via a
 set-UID program.
* [CVE-2017-5986](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5986)
Alexander Popov reported a race condition in the SCTP
 implementation that can be used by local users to cause a
 denial-of-service (crash). The initial fix for this was incorrect
 and introduced further security issues ([CVE-2017-6353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6353)). This update includes a later fix that
 avoids those. On systems that do not already have the sctp
 module loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling it:
 `echo>> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-sctp.conf install sctp false`
* [CVE-2017-6214](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6214)
Dmitry Vyukov reported a bug in the TCP implementation's handling
 of urgent data in the splice() system call. This can be used by a
 remote attacker for denial-of-service (hang) against applications
 that read from TCP sockets with splice().
* [CVE-2017-6345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6345)
Andrey Konovalov reported that the LLC type 2 implementation
 incorrectly assigns socket buffer ownership. This can be used
 by a local user to cause a denial-of-service (crash). On systems
 that do not already have the llc2 module loaded, this can be
 mitigated by disabling it:
 `echo>> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-llc2.conf install llc2 false`
* [CVE-2017-6346](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6346)
Dmitry Vyukov reported a race condition in the raw packet (af\_packet)
 fanout feature. Local users with the CAP\_NET\_RAW capability (in any
 user namespace) can use this for denial-of-service and possibly for
 privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2017-6348](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6348)
Dmitry Vyukov reported that the general queue implementation in
 the IrDA subsystem does not properly manage multiple locks,
 possibly allowing local users to cause a denial-of-service
 (deadlock) via crafted operations on IrDA devices.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.39-1+deb8u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
