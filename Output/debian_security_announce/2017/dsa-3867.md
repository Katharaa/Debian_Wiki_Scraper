Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3867-1 sudo -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 May 2017
Affected Packages:

[sudo](https://packages.debian.org/src:sudo)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 863731](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=863731).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-1000367](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000367).  

More information:

The Qualys Security team discovered that sudo, a program designed to
provide limited super user privileges to specific users, does not
properly parse "/proc/[pid]/stat" to read the device number of the tty
from field 7 (tty\_nr). A sudoers user can take advantage of this flaw on
an SELinux-enabled system to obtain full root privileges.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.10p3-1+deb8u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.
