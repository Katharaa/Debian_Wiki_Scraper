DSA-3852-1 squirrelmail -- security update
------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
13 May 2017
Affected Packages:

[squirrelmail](https://packages.debian.org/src:squirrelmail)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-7692](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7692).  

More information:

Dawid Golunski and Filippo Cavallarin discovered that squirrelmail, a
webmail application, incorrectly handled a user-supplied value. This
would allow a logged-in user to run arbitrary commands on the server.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.4.23~svn20120406-2+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail packages.
