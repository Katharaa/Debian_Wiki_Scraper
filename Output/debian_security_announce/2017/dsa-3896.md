More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.


* [CVE-2017-3167](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3167)
Emmanuel Dreyfus reported that the use of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by
 third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to
 authentication requirements being bypassed.
* [CVE-2017-3169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3169)
Vasileios Panopoulos of AdNovum Informatik AG discovered that
 mod\_ssl may dereference a NULL pointer when third-party modules call
 ap\_hook\_process\_connection() during an HTTP request to an HTTPS port
 leading to a denial of service.
* [CVE-2017-7659](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7659)
Robert Swiecki reported that a specially crafted HTTP/2 request
 could cause mod\_http2 to dereference a NULL pointer and crash the
 server process.
* [CVE-2017-7668](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7668)
Javier Jimenez reported that the HTTP strict parsing contains a
 flaw leading to a buffer overread in ap\_find\_token(). A remote
 attacker can take advantage of this flaw by carefully crafting a
 sequence of request headers to cause a segmentation fault, or to
 force ap\_find\_token() to return an incorrect value.
* [CVE-2017-7679](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7679)
ChenQin and Hanno Boeck reported that mod\_mime can read one byte
 past the end of a buffer when sending a malicious Content-Type
 response header.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.4.10-10+deb8u9. The oldstable distribution (jessie) is not
affected by [CVE-2017-7659](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7659).

version 2.4.25-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
