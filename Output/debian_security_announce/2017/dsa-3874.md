More information:

Agostino Sarubbo and AromalUllas discovered that ettercap, a network
security tool for traffic interception, contains vulnerabilities that
allowed an attacker able to provide maliciously crafted filters to
cause a denial-of-service via application crash.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:0.8.1-3+deb8u1.


For the upcoming stable (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions,
these problems have been fixed in version 1:0.8.2-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your ettercap packages.
