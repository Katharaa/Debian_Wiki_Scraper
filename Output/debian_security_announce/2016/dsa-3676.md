Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 838248](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=838248).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-1243](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1243), [CVE-2016-1244](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1244).  

More information:

Tuomas RÃ¤sÃ¤nen discovered two vulnerabilities in unADF, a tool to extract
files from an Amiga Disk File dump (.adf):


* [CVE-2016-1243](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1243)
A stack buffer overflow in the function extractTree() might allow an
 attacker, with control on the content of a ADF file, to execute
 arbitrary code with the privileges of the program execution.
* [CVE-2016-1244](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1244)
The unADF extractor creates the path in the destination via a mkdir
 in a system() call. Since there was no sanitization on the input of
 the filenames, an attacker can directly inject code in the pathnames
 of archived directories in an ADF file.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.7.11a-3+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.7.11a-3+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.7.11a-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your unadf packages.
