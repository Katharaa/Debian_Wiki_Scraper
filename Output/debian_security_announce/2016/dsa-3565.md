DSA-3565-1 botan1.10 -- security update
---------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[botan1.10](https://packages.debian.org/src:botan1.10)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 817932](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=817932), [Bug 822698](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=822698).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-5726](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5726), [CVE-2015-5727](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5727), [CVE-2015-7827](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7827), [CVE-2016-2194](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2194), [CVE-2016-2195](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2195), [CVE-2016-2849](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2849).  

More information:

Several security vulnerabilities were found in botan1.10, a C++
library which provides support for many common cryptographic
operations, including encryption, authentication, X.509v3 certificates
and CRLs.


* [CVE-2015-5726](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5726)
The BER decoder would crash due to reading from offset 0 of an
 empty vector if it encountered a BIT STRING which did not contain
 any data at all. This can be used to easily crash applications
 reading untrusted ASN.1 data, but does not seem exploitable for
 code execution.
* [CVE-2015-5727](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5727)
The BER decoder would allocate a fairly arbitrary amount of memory
 in a length field, even if there was no chance the read request
 would succeed. This might cause the process to run out of memory or
 invoke the OOM killer.
* [CVE-2015-7827](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7827)
Use constant time PKCS #1 unpadding to avoid possible side channel
 attack against RSA decryption
* [CVE-2016-2194](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2194)
Infinite loop in modular square root algorithm.
 The ressol function implementing the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm for
 finding square roots could be sent into a nearly infinite loop due
 to a misplaced conditional check. This could occur if a composite
 modulus is provided, as this algorithm is only defined for primes.
 This function is exposed to attacker controlled input via the
 OS2ECP function during ECC point decompression.
* [CVE-2016-2195](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2195)
Fix Heap overflow on invalid ECC point.
* [CVE-2016-2849](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2849)
Use constant time modular inverse algorithm to avoid possible
 side channel attack against ECDSA.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.10.8-2+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your botan1.10 packages.
