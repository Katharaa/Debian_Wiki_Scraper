More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that

leaks.


* [CVE-2015-8956](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8956)
It was discovered that missing input sanitising in RFCOMM Bluetooth
 socket handling may result in denial of service or information leak.

It was discovered that a race condition in the memory management
 code can be used for local privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2016-7042](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7042)
Ondrej Kozina discovered that incorrect buffer allocation in the
 proc\_keys\_show() function may result in local denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-7425](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7425)
Marco Grassi discovered a buffer overflow in the arcmsr SCSI driver
 which may result in local denial of service, or potentially,

Additionally this update fixes a regression introduced in DSA-3616-1
causing iptables performance issues (cf. Debian Bug #831014).


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.36-1+deb8u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
