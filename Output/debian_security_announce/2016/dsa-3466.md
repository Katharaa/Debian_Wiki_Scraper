----------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[krb5](https://packages.debian.org/src:krb5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 813126](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813126), [Bug 813127](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813127), [Bug 813296](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813296).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-8629](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8629), [CVE-2015-8630](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8630), [CVE-2015-8631](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8631).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in krb5, the MIT implementation
of Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:


* [CVE-2015-8629](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8629)
It was discovered that an authenticated attacker can cause kadmind
 to read beyond the end of allocated memory by sending a string
 without a terminating zero byte. Information leakage may be possible
 for an attacker with permission to modify the database.
* [CVE-2015-8630](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8630)
It was discovered that an authenticated attacker with permission to
 modify a principal entry can cause kadmind to dereference a null
 pointer by supplying a null policy value but including KADM5\_POLICY
 in the mask.
* [CVE-2015-8631](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8631)
It was discovered that an authenticated attacker can cause kadmind
 to leak memory by supplying a null principal name in a request which
 uses one. Repeating these requests will eventually cause kadmind to
 exhaust all available memory.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u7. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is
not affected by [CVE-2015-8630](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8630).


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.1+dfsg-19+deb8u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.
