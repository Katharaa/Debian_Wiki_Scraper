More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a full virtualization
solution on x86 hardware.


* [CVE-2015-7295](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7295)
Jason Wang of Red Hat Inc. discovered that the Virtual Network
 Device support is vulnerable to denial-of-service (via resource
 exhaustion), that could occur when receiving large packets.
* [CVE-2015-7504](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7504)
Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc.
 discovered that the PC-Net II ethernet controller is vulnerable to
 a heap-based buffer overflow that could result in
 denial-of-service (via application crash) or arbitrary code
 execution.
* [CVE-2015-7512](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7512)
Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Jason Wang of Red Hat Inc.
 discovered that the PC-Net II ethernet controller is vulnerable to
 a buffer overflow that could result in denial-of-service (via
 application crash) or arbitrary code execution.
* [CVE-2015-8345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8345)
Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the eepro100
 emulator contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite loop when
 processing Command Blocks, eventually resulting in
 denial-of-service (via application crash).
* [CVE-2015-8504](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8504)
Lian Yihan of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the VNC display
 driver support is vulnerable to an arithmetic exception flaw that
 could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).
* [CVE-2015-8558](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8558)
Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the USB EHCI
 emulation support contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite
 loop during communication between the host controller and a device
 driver. This could lead to denial-of-service (via resource
 exhaustion).
* [CVE-2015-8743](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8743)
Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the NE2000 emulator is
 vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write access issue, potentially
 resulting in information leak or memory corruption.
* [CVE-2016-1568](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1568)
Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the IDE AHCI
 emulation support is vulnerable to a use-after-free issue, that
 could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash) or
 arbitrary code execution.
* [CVE-2016-1714](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1714)
Donghai Zhu of Alibaba discovered that the Firmware Configuration
 emulation support is vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write
 access issue, that could lead to denial-of-service (via
 application crash) or arbitrary code execution.
* [CVE-2016-1922](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1922)
Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that 32-bit Windows guests
 support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference issue, that
 could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u12.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.
