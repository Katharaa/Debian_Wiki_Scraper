More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in pdns, an authoritative
DNS server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:


* [CVE-2016-5426](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5426) / [CVE-2016-5427](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5427)
Florian Heinz and Martin Kluge reported that the PowerDNS
 Authoritative Server accepts queries with a qname's length larger
 than 255 bytes and does not properly handle dot inside labels. A
 remote, unauthenticated attacker can take advantage of these flaws
 to cause abnormal load on the PowerDNS backend by sending specially
 crafted DNS queries, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-6172](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6172)
It was reported that a malicious primary DNS server can crash a
 secondary PowerDNS server due to improper restriction of zone size
 limits. This update adds a feature to limit AXFR sizes in response
 to this flaw.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.4.1-4+deb8u6.


We recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.
