DSA-3589-1 gdk-pixbuf -- security update
----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 May 2016
Affected Packages:

[gdk-pixbuf](https://packages.debian.org/src:gdk-pixbuf)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-7552](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7552), [CVE-2015-8875](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8875).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in gdk-pixbuf, a toolkit
for image loading and pixel buffer manipulation. A remote attacker can
take advantage of these flaws to cause a denial-of-service against an
application using gdk-pixbuf (application crash), or potentially, to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application, if a malformed image is opened.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.31.1-2+deb8u5.


We recommend that you upgrade your gdk-pixbuf packages.
