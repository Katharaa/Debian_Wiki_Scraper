More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libgd2, a library for
programmatic graphics creation and manipulation. A remote attacker can
take advantage of these flaws to cause a denial-of-service against an
application using the libgd2 library (application crash), or potentially
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.0-5+deb8u4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.2-29-g3c2b605-1 or earlier.


We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.
