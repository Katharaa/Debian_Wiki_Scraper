In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-7513](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7513), [CVE-2015-7550](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7550), [CVE-2015-8543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8543), [CVE-2015-8550](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8550), [CVE-2015-8551](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8551), [CVE-2015-8552](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8552), [CVE-2015-8569](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8569), [CVE-2015-8575](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8575), [CVE-2015-8709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8709).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leak.


* [CVE-2015-7513](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7513)
It was discovered that a local user permitted to use the x86 KVM
 subsystem could configure the PIT emulation to cause a denial of
 service (crash).
* [CVE-2015-7550](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7550)
Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the keyring subsystem
 that allows a local user to cause a denial of service (crash).
* [CVE-2015-8543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8543)
It was discovered that a local user permitted to create raw sockets
 could cause a denial-of-service by specifying an invalid protocol
 number for the socket. The attacker must have the CAP\_NET\_RAW
 capability.
* [CVE-2015-8550](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8550)
Felix Wilhelm of ERNW discovered that the Xen PV backend drivers
 may read critical data from shared memory multiple times. This
 flaw can be used by a guest kernel to cause a denial of service
 (crash) on the host, or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2015-8551](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8551) /
 [CVE-2015-8552](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8552)
Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk of Oracle discovered that the Xen PCI
 backend driver does not adequately validate the device state when
 a guest configures MSIs. This flaw can be used by a guest kernel
 to cause a denial of service (crash or disk space exhaustion) on
 the host.
* [CVE-2015-8569](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8569)
Dmitry Vyukov discovered a flaw in the PPTP sockets implementation
 that leads to an information leak to local users.
* [CVE-2015-8575](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8575)
David Miller discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth SCO sockets
 implementation that leads to an information leak to local users.
* [CVE-2015-8709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8709)
Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the permission checks for use of
 the ptrace feature. A local user who has the CAP\_SYS\_PTRACE
 capability within their own user namespace could use this flaw for
 privilege escalation if a more privileged process ever enters that
 user namespace. This affects at least the LXC system.


In addition, this update fixes some regressions in the previous update:


* [#808293](https://bugs.debian.org/808293)
A regression in the UDP implementation prevented freeradius and
 some other applications from receiving data.
* [#808602](https://bugs.debian.org/808602) /
 [#808953](https://bugs.debian.org/808953)
A regression in the USB XHCI driver prevented use of some devices
 in USB 3 SuperSpeed ports.
* [#808973](https://bugs.debian.org/808973)
A fix to the radeon driver interacted with an existing bug to
 cause a crash at boot when using some AMD/ATI graphics cards.
 This issue only affects wheezy.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.73-2+deb7u2. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not
affected by [CVE-2015-8709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8709).


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u2.
[CVE-2015-8543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8543)
was already fixed in version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.3-3 or earlier.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
