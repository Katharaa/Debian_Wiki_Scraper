More information:

Marcin Icewall Noga of Cisco Talos discovered an out-of-bound read
vulnerability in the CInArchive::ReadFileItem method in p7zip, a 7zr
file archiver with high compression ratio. A remote attacker can take
advantage of this flaw to cause a denial-of-service or, potentially the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
p7zip, if a specially crafted UDF file is processed.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.20.1~dfsg.1-4.1+deb8u2.


For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 15.14.1+dfsg-2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 15.14.1+dfsg-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your p7zip packages.
