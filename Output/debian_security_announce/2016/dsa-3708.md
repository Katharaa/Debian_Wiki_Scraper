DSA-3708-1 mat -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Nov 2016
Affected Packages:

[mat](https://packages.debian.org/src:mat)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 826101](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=826101).  

More information:

Hartmut Goebel discovered that MAT, a toolkit to anonymise/remove
metadata from files did not remove metadata from images embededed in PDF
documents.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.2-3+deb8u1. This update disables PDF support in MAT
entirely.


We recommend that you upgrade your mat packages.
