Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3623-1 apache2 -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
20 Jul 2016
Affected Packages:

[apache2](https://packages.debian.org/src:apache2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-5387](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5387).  

More information:

Scott Geary of VendHQ discovered that the Apache HTTPD server used the
value of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the
HTTP\_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was
incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the
proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use
this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an
attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.10-10+deb8u5.


We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
