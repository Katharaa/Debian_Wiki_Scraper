Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 812441](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=812441), [Bug 812445](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=812445), [Bug 812455](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=812455).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-7547](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7547), [CVE-2015-8776](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8776), [CVE-2015-8778](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8778), [CVE-2015-8779](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8779).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been fixed in the GNU C Library, glibc.


The first vulnerability listed below is considered to have critical
impact.


* [CVE-2015-7547](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7547)
The Google Security Team and Red Hat discovered that the glibc
 host name resolver function, getaddrinfo, when processing
 AF\_UNSPEC queries (for dual A/AAAA lookups), could mismanage its
 internal buffers, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow and
 arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability affects most
 applications which perform host name resolution using getaddrinfo,
 including system services.
* [CVE-2015-8776](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8776)
Adam Nielsen discovered that if an invalid separated time value
 is passed to strftime, the strftime function could crash or leak
 information. Applications normally pass only valid time
 information to strftime; no affected applications are known.
* [CVE-2015-8778](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8778)
Szabolcs Nagy reported that the rarely-used hcreate and hcreate\_r
 functions did not check the size argument properly, leading to a
 crash (denial of service) for certain arguments. No impacted
 applications are known at this time.
* [CVE-2015-8779](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8779)
The catopen function contains several unbound stack allocations
 (stack overflows), causing it the crash the process (denial of
 service). No applications where this issue has a security impact
 are currently known.


While it is only necessary to ensure that all processes are not using
the old glibc anymore, it is recommended to reboot the machines after
applying the security upgrade.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.19-18+deb8u3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.21-8.


We recommend that you upgrade your glibc packages.
