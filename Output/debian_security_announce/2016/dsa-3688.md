More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in NSS, the cryptography
library developed by the Mozilla project.


* [CVE-2015-4000](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4000)
David Adrian et al. reported that it may be feasible to attack
 Diffie-Hellman-based cipher suites in certain circumstances,
 compromising the confidentiality and integrity of data encrypted
 with Transport Layer Security (TLS).
* [CVE-2015-7181](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7181)
[CVE-2015-7182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7182)
[CVE-2016-1950](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1950)
Tyson Smith, David Keeler, and Francis Gabriel discovered
 heap-based buffer overflows in the ASN.1 DER parser, potentially
 leading to arbitrary code execution.
* [CVE-2015-7575](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7575)
Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that TLS client implementation
 accepted MD5-based signatures for TLS 1.2 connections with forward
 secrecy, weakening the intended security strength of TLS
 connections.
* [CVE-2016-1938](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1938)
Hanno Boeck discovered that NSS miscomputed the result of integer
 division for certain inputs. This could weaken the cryptographic
 protections provided by NSS. However, NSS implements RSA-CRT leak
 hardening, so RSA private keys are not directly disclosed by this
 issue.
* [CVE-2016-1978](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1978)
Eric Rescorla discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the
 implementation of ECDH-based TLS handshakes, with unknown
 consequences.
* [CVE-2016-1979](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1979)
Tim Taubert discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in ASN.1 DER
 processing, with application-specific impact.
* [CVE-2016-2834](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2834)
Tyson Smith and Jed Davis discovered unspecified memory-safety
 bugs in NSS.


In addition, the NSS library did not ignore environment variables in
processes which underwent a SUID/SGID/AT\_SECURE transition at process
start. In certain system configurations, this allowed local users to
escalate their privileges.


This update contains further correctness and stability fixes without
immediate security impact.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.26-1+debu8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.23-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.
