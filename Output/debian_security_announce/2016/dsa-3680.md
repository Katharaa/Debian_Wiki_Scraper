More information:

Two vulnerabilities were reported in BIND, a DNS server.


* [CVE-2016-2775](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2775)
The lwresd component in BIND (which is not enabled by default)
 could crash while processing an overlong request name. This could
 lead to a denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-2776](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2776)
A crafted query could crash the BIND name server daemon, leading
 to a denial of service. All server roles (authoritative,
 recursive and forwarding) in default configurations are
 affected.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u7.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
