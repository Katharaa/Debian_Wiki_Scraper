More information:

Markus Krell discovered that xymon, a network- and
applications-monitoring system, was vulnerable to the following
security issues:


* [CVE-2016-2054](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2054)
The incorrect handling of user-supplied input in the config
 command can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in
 denial of service (via application crash) or remote code execution.
* [CVE-2016-2055](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2055)
The incorrect handling of user-supplied input in the config
 command can lead to an information leak by serving sensitive
 configuration files to a remote user.
* [CVE-2016-2056](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2056)
The commands handling password management do not properly validate
 user-supplied input, and are thus vulnerable to shell command
 injection by a remote user.
* [CVE-2016-2057](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2057)
Incorrect permissions on an internal queuing system allow a user
 with a local account on the xymon master server to bypass all
 network-based access control lists, and thus inject messages
 directly into xymon.
* [CVE-2016-2058](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2058)
Incorrect escaping of user-supplied input in status webpages can
 be used to trigger reflected cross-site scripting attacks.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.17-6+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your xymon packages.
