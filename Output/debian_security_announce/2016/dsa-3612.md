----------------------------------



Date Reported:
01 Jul 2016
Affected Packages:

[gimp](https://packages.debian.org/src:gimp)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 828179](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=828179).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-4994](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4994).  

More information:

Shmuel H discovered that GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program, is
prone to a use-after-free vulnerability in the channel and layer
properties parsing process when loading a XCF file. An attacker can take
advantage of this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running GIMP if a specially crafted XCF file is
processed.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.14-1+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your gimp packages.
