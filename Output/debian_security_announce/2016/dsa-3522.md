DSA-3522-1 squid3 -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[squid3](https://packages.debian.org/src:squid3)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-2571](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2571).  

More information:

Alex Rousskov from The Measurement Factory discovered that Squid3, a
fully featured web proxy cache, does not properly handle errors for
certain malformed HTTP responses. A remote HTTP server can exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit).


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.1.20-2.2+deb7u4.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.8-6+deb8u2.


For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.5.15-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.15-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.
