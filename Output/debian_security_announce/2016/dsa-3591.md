Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3591-1 imagemagick -- security update
-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
01 Jun 2016
Affected Packages:

[imagemagick](https://packages.debian.org/src:imagemagick)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 825799](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=825799).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-5118](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5118).  

More information:

Bob Friesenhahn from the GraphicsMagick project discovered a command
injection vulnerability in ImageMagick, a program suite for image
manipulation. An attacker with control on input image or the input
filename can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user
running the application. 


This update removes the possibility of using pipe (|) in filenames to
interact with imagemagick.


It is important that you upgrade the libmagickcore-6.q16-2 and not just
the imagemagick package. Applications using libmagickcore-6.q16-2 might
also be affected and need to be restarted after the upgrade.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.
