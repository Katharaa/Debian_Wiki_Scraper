More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mercurial, a distributed
version control system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2016-3068](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3068)
Blake Burkhart discovered that Mercurial allows URLs for Git
 subrepositories that could result in arbitrary code execution on
 clone.
* [CVE-2016-3069](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3069)
Blake Burkhart discovered that Mercurial allows arbitrary code
 execution when converting Git repositories with specially
 crafted names.
* [CVE-2016-3630](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3630)
It was discovered that Mercurial does not properly perform bounds-checking
 in its binary delta decoder, which may be exploitable for
 remote code execution via clone, push or pull.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.2.2-4+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.2-2+deb8u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.7.3-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your mercurial packages.
