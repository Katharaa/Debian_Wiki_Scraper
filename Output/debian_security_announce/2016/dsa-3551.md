Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 779047](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=779047).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-8836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8836), [CVE-2015-8837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8837).  

More information:

It was discovered that fuseiso, a user-space implementation of the
ISO 9660 file system based on FUSE, contains several vulnerabilities.


* [CVE-2015-8836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8836)
A stack-based buffer overflow may allow attackers who can trick a
 user into mounting a crafted ISO 9660 file system to cause a
 denial of service (crash), or, potentially, execute arbitrary
 code.
* [CVE-2015-8837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8837)
An integer overflow leads to a heap-based buffer overflow, which
 allows an attacker (who can trick a user into mounting a crafted
 ISO 9660 file system) to cause a denial of service (crash), or,
 potentially, execute arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 20070708-3+deb7u1.


The stable distribution (jessie) does not contain fuseiso packages.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 20070708-3.2.


We recommend that you upgrade your fuseiso packages.
