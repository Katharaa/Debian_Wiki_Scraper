Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3743-1 python-bottle -- security update
-------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
20 Dec 2016
Affected Packages:

[python-bottle](https://packages.debian.org/src:python-bottle)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 848392](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=848392).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-9964](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9964).  

More information:

It was discovered that bottle, a WSGI-framework for the Python
programming language, did not properly filter "\r\n" sequences when
handling redirections. This allowed an attacker to perform CRLF
attacks such as HTTP header injection.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.7-1+deb8u1.


For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 0.12.11-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your python-bottle packages.
