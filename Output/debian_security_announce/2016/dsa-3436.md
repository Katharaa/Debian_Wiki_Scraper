More information:

Karthikeyan Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent at INRIA discovered a flaw in
the TLS 1.2 protocol which could allow the MD5 hash function to be used
for signing ServerKeyExchange and Client Authentication packets during a
TLS handshake. A man-in-the-middle attacker could exploit this flaw to
conduct collision attacks to impersonate a TLS server or an
authenticated TLS client.
