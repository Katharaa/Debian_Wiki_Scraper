More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been fixed in the GNU C Library, eglibc.


The [CVE-2015-7547](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7547) vulnerability listed below is considered to have
critical impact.


* [CVE-2014-8121](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8121)
Robin Hack discovered that the nss\_files database did not
 correctly implement enumeration interleaved with name-based or
 ID-based lookups. This could cause the enumeration enter an
 endless loop, leading to a denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-1781](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1781)
Arjun Shankar discovered that the \_r variants of host name
 resolution functions (like gethostbyname\_r), when performing DNS
 name resolution, suffered from a buffer overflow if a misaligned
 buffer was supplied by the applications, leading to a crash or,
 potentially, arbitrary code execution. Most applications are not
 affected by this vulnerability because they use aligned buffers.
* [CVE-2015-7547](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7547)
The Google Security Team and Red Hat discovered that the eglibc
 host name resolver function, getaddrinfo, when processing
 AF\_UNSPEC queries (for dual A/AAAA lookups), could mismanage its
 internal buffers, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow and
 arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability affects most
 applications which perform host name resolution using getaddrinfo,
 including system services.
* [CVE-2015-8776](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8776)
Adam Nielsen discovered that if an invalid separated time value
 is passed to strftime, the strftime function could crash or leak
 information. Applications normally pass only valid time
 information to strftime; no affected applications are known.
* [CVE-2015-8777](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8777)
Hector Marco-Gisbert reported that LD\_POINTER\_GUARD was not
 ignored for SUID programs, enabling an unintended bypass of a
 security feature. This update causes eglibc to always ignore the
 LD\_POINTER\_GUARD environment variable.
* [CVE-2015-8778](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8778)
Szabolcs Nagy reported that the rarely-used hcreate and hcreate\_r
 functions did not check the size argument properly, leading to a
 crash (denial of service) for certain arguments. No impacted
 applications are known at this time.
* [CVE-2015-8779](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8779)
The catopen function contains several unbound stack allocations
 (stack overflows), causing it the crash the process (denial of
 service). No applications where this issue has a security impact
 are currently known.


The following fixed vulnerabilities currently lack CVE assignment:


* Joseph Myers reported that an integer overflow in the
 strxfrm can lead to heap-based buffer overflow, possibly allowing
 arbitrary code execution. In addition, a fallback path in strxfrm
 uses an unbounded stack allocation (stack overflow), leading to a
 crash or erroneous application behavior.
* Kostya Serebryany reported that the fnmatch function could skip
 over the terminating NUL character of a malformed pattern, causing
 an application calling fnmatch to crash (denial of service).
* Joseph Myers reported that the IO\_wstr\_overflow function,
 internally used by wide-oriented character streams, suffered from
 an integer overflow, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. On
 GNU/Linux systems, wide-oriented character streams are rarely
 used, and no affected applications are known.
* Andreas Schwab reported a memory leak (memory allocation without a
 matching deallocation) while processing certain DNS answers in
 getaddrinfo, related to the \_nss\_dns\_gethostbyname4\_r function.
 This vulnerability could lead to a denial of service.


While it is only necessary to ensure that all processes are not using
the old eglibc anymore, it is recommended to reboot the machines after
applying the security upgrade.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.13-38+deb7u10.


We recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.
