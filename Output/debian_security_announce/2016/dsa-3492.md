-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
28 Feb 2016
Affected Packages:

[gajim](https://packages.debian.org/src:gajim)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 816158](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=816158).  

More information:

The wheezy part of the previous gajim update, DSA-3492-1, was
incorrectly built resulting in an unsatisfiable dependency. This update
corrects that problem. For reference, the original advisory text
follows.


Daniel Gultsch discovered a vulnerability in Gajim, an XMPP/jabber
client. Gajim didn't verify the origin of roster update, allowing an
attacker to spoof them and potentially allowing her to intercept
messages.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.15.1-4.1+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.16-1+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.16.5-0.1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.16.5-0.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your gajim packages.
