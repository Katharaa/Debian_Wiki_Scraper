Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-2806](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2806).  

More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client: Multiple memory safety errors may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.


Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Thunderbird. Support
for the 38.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 45.x releases.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:45.1.0-1~deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:45.1.0-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:45.1.0-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
