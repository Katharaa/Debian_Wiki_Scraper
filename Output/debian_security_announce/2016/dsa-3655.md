More information:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in MuPDF, a lightweight PDF viewer.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


* [CVE-2016-6265](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6265)
Marco Grassi discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in MuPDF. An
 attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause an application
 crash (denial-of-service), or potentially to execute arbitrary code
 with the privileges of the user running MuPDF, if a specially
 crafted PDF file is processed.
* [CVE-2016-6525](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6525)
Yu Hong and Zheng Jihong discovered a heap overflow vulnerability
 within the pdf\_load\_mesh\_params function, allowing an attacker to
 cause an application crash (denial-of-service), or potentially to
 execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
 MuPDF, if a specially crafted PDF file is processed.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5-1+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your mupdf packages.
