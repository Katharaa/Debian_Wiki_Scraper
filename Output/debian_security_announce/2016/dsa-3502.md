========================


DSA-3502-1 roundup -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
03 Mar 2016
Affected Packages:

[roundup](https://packages.debian.org/src:roundup)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-6276](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-6276).  

More information:

Ralf Schlatterbeck discovered an information leak in roundup, a
web-based issue tracking system. An authenticated attacker could use it
to see sensitive details about other users, including their hashed
password.


After applying the update, which will fix the shipped templates, the
site administrator should ensure the instanced versions (in
/var/lib/roundup usually) are also updated, either by patching them
manually or by recreating them.


More info can be found in the upstream documentation at
<http://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading.html#user-data-visibility>


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.4.20-1.1+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.20-1.1+deb8u1.


For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distribution, this problem has not
yet been fixed.


We recommend that you upgrade your roundup packages.
