DSA-3577-1 jansson -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
14 May 2016
Affected Packages:

[jansson](https://packages.debian.org/src:jansson)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 823238](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=823238).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-4425](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4425).  

More information:

Gustavo Grieco discovered that jansson, a C library for encoding,
decoding and manipulating JSON data, did not limit the recursion depth
when parsing JSON arrays and objects. This could allow remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (crash) via stack exhaustion, using crafted
JSON data.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-1+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-5.


We recommend that you upgrade your jansson packages.
