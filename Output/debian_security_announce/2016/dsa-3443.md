More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the libpng PNG library.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


* [CVE-2015-8472](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8472)
It was discovered that the original fix for
 [CVE-2015-8126](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8126) was
 incomplete and did not detect a potential overrun by applications
 using png\_set\_PLTE directly. A remote attacker can take advantage of
 this flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash).
* [CVE-2015-8540](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8540)
Xiao Qixue and Chen Yu discovered a flaw in the png\_check\_keyword
 function. A remote attacker can potentially take advantage of this
 flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash).


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.49-1+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.50-2+deb8u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.
