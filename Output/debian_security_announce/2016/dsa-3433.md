More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2015-3223](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3223)
Thilo Uttendorfer of Linux Information Systems AG discovered that a
 malicious request can cause the Samba LDAP server to hang, spinning
 using CPU. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
 mount a denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-5252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5252)
Jan Yenya Kasprzak and the Computer Systems Unit team at Faculty
 of Informatics, Masaryk University discovered that insufficient
 symlink verification could allow data access outside an exported
 share path.
* [CVE-2015-5296](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5296)
Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet discovered that Samba does not ensure
 that signing is negotiated when creating an encrypted client
 connection to a server. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to
 downgrade the connection and connect using the supplied credentials
 as an unsigned, unencrypted connection.
* [CVE-2015-5299](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5299)
It was discovered that a missing access control check in the VFS
 shadow\_copy2 module could allow unauthorized users to access
 snapshots.
* [CVE-2015-5330](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5330)
Douglas Bagnall of Catalyst discovered that the Samba LDAP server
 is vulnerable to a remote memory read attack. A remote attacker can
 obtain sensitive information from daemon heap memory by sending
 crafted packets and then either read an error message, or a
 database value.
* [CVE-2015-7540](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7540)
It was discovered that a malicious client can send packets that
 cause the LDAP server provided by the AD DC in the samba daemon
 process to consume unlimited memory and be terminated.
* [CVE-2015-8467](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8467)
Andrew Bartlett of the Samba Team and Catalyst discovered that a
 Samba server deployed as an AD DC can expose Windows DCs in the same
 domain to a denial of service via the creation of multiple machine
 accounts. This issue is related to the MS15-096 / [CVE-2015-2535](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2535)
 security issue in Windows.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u6. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is only
affected by [CVE-2015-5252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5252), [CVE-2015-5296](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5296) and [CVE-2015-5299](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5299).


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.17+dfsg-2+deb8u1. The fixes for [CVE-2015-3223](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3223) and
[CVE-2015-5330](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5330) required an update to ldb 2:1.1.17-2+deb8u1 to correct the
defects.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.22+dfsg-1. The fixes for [CVE-2015-3223](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3223) and [CVE-2015-5330](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5330)
required an update to ldb 2:1.1.24-1 to correct the defects.


We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
