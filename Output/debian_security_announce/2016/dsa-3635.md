Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3635-1 libdbd-mysql-perl -- security update
-----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
29 Jul 2016
Affected Packages:

[libdbd-mysql-perl](https://packages.debian.org/src:libdbd-mysql-perl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-9906](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9906), [CVE-2015-8949](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8949).  

More information:

Two use-after-free vulnerabilities were discovered in DBD::mysql, a Perl
DBI driver for the MySQL database server. A remote attacker can take
advantage of these flaws to cause a denial-of-service against an
application using DBD::mysql (application crash), or potentially to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.028-2+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libdbd-mysql-perl packages.
