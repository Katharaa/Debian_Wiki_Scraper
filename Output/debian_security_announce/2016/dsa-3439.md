DSA-3439-1 prosody -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Jan 2016
Affected Packages:

[prosody](https://packages.debian.org/src:prosody)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-1231](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1231), [CVE-2016-1232](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1232).  

More information:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Prosody, a lightweight
Jabber/XMPP server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2016-1231](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1231)
Kim Alvefur discovered a flaw in Prosody's HTTP file-serving module
 that allows it to serve requests outside of the configured public
 root directory. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to access
 private files including sensitive data. The default configuration
 does not enable the mod\_http\_files module and thus is not
 vulnerable.
* [CVE-2016-1232](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1232)
Thijs Alkemade discovered that Prosody's generation of the secret
 token for server-to-server dialback authentication relied upon a
 weak random number generator that was not cryptographically secure.
 A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to guess at
 probable values of the secret key and impersonate the affected
 domain to other servers on the network.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.8.2-4+deb7u3.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.7-2+deb8u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your prosody packages.
