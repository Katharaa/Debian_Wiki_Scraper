========================


DSA-3687-1 nspr -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
05 Oct 2016
Affected Packages:

[nspr](https://packages.debian.org/src:nspr)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 583651](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=583651).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-1951](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1951).  

More information:

Two vulnerabilities were reported in NSPR, a library to abstract over
operating system interfaces developed by the Mozilla project.


* [CVE-2016-1951](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1951)
q1 reported that the NSPR implementation of sprintf-style string
 formatting function miscomputed memory allocation sizes,
 potentially leading to heap-based buffer overflows


The second issue concerns environment variable processing in NSPR.
The library did not ignore environment variables used to configuring
logging and tracing in processes which underwent a SUID/SGID/AT\_SECURE
transition at process start. In certain system configurations, this
allowed local users to escalate their privileges.


In addition, this nspr update contains further stability and
correctness fixes and contains support code for an upcoming nss
update.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:4.12-1+debu8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.12-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your nspr packages.
