========================


DSA-3536-1 libstruts1.2-java -- security update
-----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
31 Mar 2016
Affected Packages:

[libstruts1.2-java](https://packages.debian.org/src:libstruts1.2-java)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-0899](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0899).  

More information:

It was discovered that libstruts1.2-java, a Java framework for MVC
applications, contains a bug in its multi-page validation code. This
allows input validation to be bypassed, even if MPV is not used
directly.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.2.9-5+deb7u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your libstruts1.2-java packages.
