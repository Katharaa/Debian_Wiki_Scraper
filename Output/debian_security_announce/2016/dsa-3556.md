Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 822242](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=822242).

More information:

Hans Jerry Illikainen discovered that libgd2, a library for programmatic
graphics creation and manipulation, suffers of a signedness
vulnerability which may result in a heap overflow when processing
specially crafted compressed gd2 data. A remote attacker can take
advantage of this flaw to cause an application using the libgd2 library
to crash, or potentially, to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
of the user running the application.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0.36~rc1~dfsg-6.1+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-5+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.1-4.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.
