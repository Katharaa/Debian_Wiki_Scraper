Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-1572](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1572).  

More information:

Jann Horn discovered that the setuid-root mount.ecryptfs\_private helper
in the ecryptfs-utils would mount over any target directory that the
user owns, including a directory in procfs. A local attacker could use
this flaw to escalate his privileges.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 99-1+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 103-5+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ecryptfs-utils packages.
