More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2014-9904](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9904)
It was discovered that the snd\_compress\_check\_input function used in
 the ALSA subsystem does not properly check for an integer overflow,
 allowing a local user to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-5728](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5728)
Pengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the MIC VOP driver that
 could allow a local user to obtain sensitive information from kernel
 memory or cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-5828](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5828)
Cyril Bur and Michael Ellerman discovered a flaw in the handling of
 Transactional Memory on powerpc systems allowing a local user to
 cause a denial of service (kernel crash) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact, by starting a transaction, suspending it,
 and then calling any of the exec() class system calls.
* [CVE-2016-5829](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5829)
A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the hiddev
 driver, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service or,
 potentially escalate their privileges.
* [CVE-2016-6130](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6130)
Pengfei Wang discovered a flaw in the S/390 character device drivers
 potentially leading to information leak with /dev/sclp.


Additionally this update fixes a regression in the ebtables facility
(#828914) that was introduced in DSA-3607-1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt25-2+deb8u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
