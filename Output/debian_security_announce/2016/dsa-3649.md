Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3649-1 gnupg -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
17 Aug 2016
Affected Packages:

[gnupg](https://packages.debian.org/src:gnupg)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-6313](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6313).  

More information:

Felix Doerre and Vladimir Klebanov from the Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology discovered a flaw in the mixing functions of GnuPG's random
number generator. An attacker who obtains 4640 bits from the RNG can
trivially predict the next 160 bits of output.


A first analysis on the impact of this bug for GnuPG shows that existing
RSA keys are not weakened. For DSA and Elgamal keys it is also unlikely
that the private key can be predicted from other public information.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.18-7+deb8u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.
