------------------------------------



Date Reported:
09 Mar 2016
Affected Packages:

[libotr](https://packages.debian.org/src:libotr)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-2851](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2851).  

More information:

Markus Vervier of X41 D-Sec GmbH discovered an integer overflow
vulnerability in libotr, an off-the-record (OTR) messaging library, in
the way how the sizes of portions of incoming messages were stored. A
remote attacker can exploit this flaw by sending crafted messages to an
application that is using libotr to perform denial of service attacks
(application crash), or potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.2.1-1+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.0-2+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libotr packages.
