Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3634-1 redis -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 Jul 2016
Affected Packages:

[redis](https://packages.debian.org/src:redis)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 832460](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=832460).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-7458](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7458).  

More information:

It was discovered that redis, a persistent key-value database, did not
properly protect redis-cli history files: they were created by default
with world-readable permissions.


Users and systems administrators may want to proactively change
permissions on existing ~/rediscli\_history files, instead of waiting
for the updated redis-cli to do so the next time it is run.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:2.8.17-1+deb8u5.


For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 2:3.2.1-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your redis packages.
