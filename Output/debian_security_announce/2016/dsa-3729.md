More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:


* [CVE-2016-7777](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7777)
 (XSA-190)
 Jan Beulich from SUSE discovered that Xen does not properly honor
 CR0.TS and CR0.EM for x86 HVM guests, potentially allowing guest
 users to read or modify FPU, MMX, or XMM register state information
 belonging to arbitrary tasks on the guest by modifying an
 instruction while the hypervisor is preparing to emulate it.
* [CVE-2016-9379](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9379),
 [CVE-2016-9380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9380) (XSA-198)
 Daniel Richman and Gabor Szarka of the Cambridge University
 Student-Run Computing Facility discovered that pygrub, the boot
 loader emulator, fails to quote (or sanity check) its results when
 reporting them to its caller. A malicious guest administrator can
 take advantage of this flaw to cause an information leak or denial
 of service.
* [CVE-2016-9382](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9382)
 (XSA-192)
 Jan Beulich of SUSE discovered that Xen does not properly handle x86
 task switches to VM86 mode. A unprivileged guest process can take
 advantage of this flaw to crash the guest or, escalate its
 privileges to that of the guest operating system.
* [CVE-2016-9383](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9383)
 (XSA-195)
 George Dunlap of Citrix discovered that the Xen x86 64-bit bit test
 instruction emulation is broken. A malicious guest can take
 advantage of this flaw to modify arbitrary memory, allowing for
 arbitrary code execution, denial of service (host crash), or
 information leaks.
* [CVE-2016-9385](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9385)
 (XSA-193)
 Andrew Cooper of Citrix discovered that Xen's x86 segment base write
 emulation lacks canonical address checks. A malicious guest
 administrator can take advantage of this flaw to crash the host,
 leading to a denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-9386](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9386)
 (XSA-191)
 Andrew Cooper of Citrix discovered that x86 null segments are not
 always treated as unusable. An unprivileged guest user program
 may be able to elevate its privilege to that of the guest
 operating system.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.1-9+deb8u8.


We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.
