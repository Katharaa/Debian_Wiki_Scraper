Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the Human Monitor
 Interface support is vulnerable to an out-of-bound write access
 issue that could result in denial-of-service (via application
 crash).
* [CVE-2015-8743](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8743)
Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the NE2000 emulator is
 vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write access issue, potentially
 resulting in information leak or memory corruption.
* [CVE-2015-8744](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8744)
The vmxnet3 driver incorrectly processes small packets, which could
 result in denial-of-service (via application crash).
* [CVE-2015-8745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8745)
The vmxnet3 driver incorrectly processes Interrupt Mask Registers,
 which could result in denial-of-service (via application crash).
* [CVE-2016-1568](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1568)
Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the IDE AHCI
 emulation support is vulnerable to a use-after-free issue, that
 could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash) or
 arbitrary code execution.
* [CVE-2016-1714](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1714)
