In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-2511](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2511).  

More information:

Jakub Palaczynski discovered that websvn, a web viewer for Subversion
repositories, does not correctly sanitize user-supplied input, which
allows a remote user to run reflected cross-site scripting attacks.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.3.3-1.1+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-1.2+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your websvn packages.
