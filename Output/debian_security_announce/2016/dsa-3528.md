Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-8833](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8833).  

More information:

Stefan Sperling discovered that pidgin-otr, a Pidgin plugin
implementing Off-The-Record messaging, contained a use-after-free
bug. This could be used by a malicious remote user to intentionally
crash the application, thus causing a denial-of-service.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.1-1+deb8u1.


For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 4.0.2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin-otr packages.
