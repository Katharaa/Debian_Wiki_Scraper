Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-0749](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0749), [CVE-2016-2150](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2150).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in spice, a SPICE protocol
client and server library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2016-0749](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0749)
Jing Zhao of Red Hat discovered a memory allocation flaw, leading to
 a heap-based buffer overflow in spice's smartcard interaction. A
 user connecting to a guest VM via spice can take advantage of this
 flaw to cause a denial-of-service (QEMU process crash), or
 potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the
 privileges of the hosting QEMU process.
* [CVE-2016-2150](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2150)
Frediano Ziglio of Red Hat discovered that a malicious guest inside
 a virtual machine can take control of the corresponding QEMU process
 in the host using crafted primary surface parameters.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.5-1+deb8u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your spice packages.
