----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 May 2016
Affected Packages:

[libarchive](https://packages.debian.org/src:libarchive)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 823893](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=823893).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-1541](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1541).  

More information:

Rock Stevens, Andrew Ruef and Marcin Icewall Noga discovered a
heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the zip\_read\_mac\_metadata
function in libarchive, a multi-format archive and compression library,
which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code if a user or automated
system is tricked into processing a specially crafted ZIP file.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.2-11+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libarchive packages.
