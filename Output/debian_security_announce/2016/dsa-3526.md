Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-8792](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8792).  

More information:

It was discovered that libmatroska, an extensible open standard
audio/video container format, incorrectly processed EBML lacing. By
providing maliciously crafted input, an attacker could use this flaw
to force some leakage of information located in the process heap
memory.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.3.0-2+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-2+deb8u1.


For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 1.4.4-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libmatroska packages.
