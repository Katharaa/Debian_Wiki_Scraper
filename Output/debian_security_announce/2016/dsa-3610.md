DSA-3610-1 xerces-c -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
29 Jun 2016
Affected Packages:

[xerces-c](https://packages.debian.org/src:xerces-c)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 828990](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=828990).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-4463](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4463).  

More information:

Brandon Perry discovered that xerces-c, a validating XML parser library
for C++, fails to successfully parse a DTD that is deeply nested,
causing a stack overflow. A remote unauthenticated attacker can take
advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service against applications
using the xerces-c library.


Additionally this update includes an enhancement to enable applications
to fully disable DTD processing through the use of an environment
variable (XERCES\_DISABLE\_DTD).


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.1-5.1+deb8u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your xerces-c packages.
