========================


DSA-3741-1 tor -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
20 Dec 2016
Affected Packages:

[tor](https://packages.debian.org/src:tor)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 848847](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=848847).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-1254](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1254).  

More information:

It was discovered that Tor, a connection-based low-latency anonymous
communication system, may read one byte past a buffer when parsing
hidden service descriptors. This issue may enable a hostile hidden
service to crash Tor clients depending on hardening options and malloc
implementation.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.5.12-4.


For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 0.2.9.8-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.
