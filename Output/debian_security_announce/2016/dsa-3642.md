========================


DSA-3642-1 lighttpd -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
05 Aug 2016
Affected Packages:

[lighttpd](https://packages.debian.org/src:lighttpd)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 832571](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=832571).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-1000212](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1000212).  

More information:

Dominic Scheirlinck and Scott Geary of Vend reported insecure behavior
in the lighttpd web server. Lighttpd assigned Proxy header values from
client requests to internal HTTP\_PROXY environment variables, allowing
remote attackers to carry out Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks or
initiate connections to arbitrary hosts.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.35-4+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.
