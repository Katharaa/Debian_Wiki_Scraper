Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 809920](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=809920).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-8747](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8747), [CVE-2015-8748](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8748).  

More information:

Two vulnerabilities were fixed in radicale, a CardDAV/CalDAV server.


* [CVE-2015-8747](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8747)
The (not configured by default and not available on Wheezy)
 multifilesystem storage backend allows read and write access to
 arbitrary files (still subject to the DAC permissions of the user
 the radicale server is running as).
* [CVE-2015-8748](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8748)
If an attacker is able to authenticate with a user name like `.\*',
 he can bypass read/write limitations imposed by regex-based rules,
 including the built-in rules `owner\_write' (read for everybody,
 write for the calendar owner) and `owner\_only' (read and write for
 the the calendar owner).


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.7-1.1+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9-1+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.1-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your radicale packages.
