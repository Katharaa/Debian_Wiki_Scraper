More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Subversion, a version control
system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


* [CVE-2016-2167](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2167)
Daniel Shahaf and James McCoy discovered that an implementation
 error in the authentication against the Cyrus SASL library would
 permit a remote user to specify a realm string which is a prefix of
 the expected realm string and potentially allowing a user to
 authenticate using the wrong realm.
* [CVE-2016-2168](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2168)
Ivan Zhakov of VisualSVN discovered a remotely triggerable denial
 of service vulnerability in the mod\_authz\_svn module during COPY or
 MOVE authorization check. An authenticated remote attacker could
 take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service
 (Subversion server crash) via COPY or MOVE requests with specially
 crafted header.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.10-6+deb8u4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.4-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.
