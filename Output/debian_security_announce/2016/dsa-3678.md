Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-7401](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7401).  

More information:

Sergey Bobrov discovered that cookie parsing in Django and Google
Analytics interacted such a way that an attacker could set arbitrary
cookies. This allows other malicious web sites to bypass the
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protections built into Django.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.11-1+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.10-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
