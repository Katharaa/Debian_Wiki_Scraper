Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-2105](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2105), [CVE-2016-2106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2106), [CVE-2016-2107](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2107), [CVE-2016-2108](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2108), [CVE-2016-2109](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2109).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Socket Layer
toolkit.


* [CVE-2016-2105](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2105)
Guido Vranken discovered that an overflow can occur in the function
 EVP\_EncodeUpdate(), used for Base64 encoding, if an attacker can
 supply a large amount of data. This could lead to a heap corruption.
* [CVE-2016-2106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2106)
Guido Vranken discovered that an overflow can occur in the function
 EVP\_EncryptUpdate() if an attacker can supply a large amount of data.
 This could lead to a heap corruption.
* [CVE-2016-2107](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2107)
Juraj Somorovsky discovered a padding oracle in the AES CBC cipher
 implementation based on the AES-NI instruction set. This could allow
 an attacker to decrypt TLS traffic encrypted with one of the cipher
 suites based on AES CBC.
* [CVE-2016-2108](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2108)
David Benjamin from Google discovered that two separate bugs in the
 ASN.1 encoder, related to handling of negative zero integer values
 and large universal tags, could lead to an out-of-bounds write.
* [CVE-2016-2109](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2109)
Brian Carpenter discovered that when ASN.1 data is read from a BIO
 using functions such as d2i\_CMS\_bio(), a short invalid encoding can
 cause allocation of large amounts of memory potentially consuming
 excessive resources or exhausting memory.


Additional information about these issues can be found in the OpenSSL
security advisory at <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt>


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1k-3+deb8u5.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2h-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
