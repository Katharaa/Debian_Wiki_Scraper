DSA-3475-1 postgresql-9.1 -- security update
--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
13 Feb 2016
Affected Packages:

[postgresql-9.1](https://packages.debian.org/src:postgresql-9.1)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-5288](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5288), [CVE-2016-0766](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0766), [CVE-2016-0773](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0773).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been found in PostgreSQL-9.1, a SQL
database system.


* [CVE-2015-5288](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5288)
Josh Kupershmidt discovered a vulnerability in the crypt() function
 in the pgCrypto extension. Certain invalid salt arguments can cause
 the server to crash or to disclose a few bytes of server memory.
* [CVE-2016-0766](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0766)
A privilege escalation vulnerability for users of PL/Java was
 discovered. Certain custom configuration settings (GUCs) for PL/Java
 will now be modifiable only by the database superuser to mitigate
 this issue.
* [CVE-2016-0773](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0773)
Tom Lane and Greg Stark discovered a flaw in the way PostgreSQL
 processes specially crafted regular expressions. Very large
 character ranges in bracket expressions could cause infinite
 loops or memory overwrites. A remote attacker can exploit this
 flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, to execute
 arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 9.1.20-0+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.1 packages.
