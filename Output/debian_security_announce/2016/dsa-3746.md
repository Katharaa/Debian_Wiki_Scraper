More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in GraphicsMagick, a
collection of image processing tool, which can cause denial of service
attacks, remote file deletion, and remote command execution.


This security update removes the full support of PLT/Gnuplot decoder to
prevent Gnuplot-shell based shell exploits for fixing the
[CVE-2016-3714](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3714)
vulnerability.


The undocumented TMP magick prefix no longer removes the argument file
after it has been read for fixing the
[CVE-2016-3715](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3715)
vulnerability. Since the TMP feature was originally implemented,
GraphicsMagick added a temporary file management subsystem which assures
that temporary files are removed so this feature is not needed.


Remove support for reading input from a shell command, or writing output
to a shell command, by prefixing the specified filename (containing the
command) with a '|' for fixing the
[CVE-2016-5118](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5118)
vulnerability.


* [CVE-2015-8808](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8808)
Gustavo Grieco discovered an out of bound read in the parsing of GIF
 files which may cause denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-2317](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2317)
Gustavo Grieco discovered a stack buffer overflow and two heap buffer
 overflows while processing SVG images which may cause denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-2318](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2318)
Gustavo Grieco discovered several segmentation faults while processing
 SVG images which may cause denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-5240](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5240)
Gustavo Grieco discovered an endless loop problem caused by negative
 stroke-dasharray arguments while parsing SVG files which may cause
 denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-7800](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7800)
Marco Grassi discovered an unsigned underflow leading to heap overflow
 when parsing 8BIM chunk often attached to JPG files which may cause
 denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-7996](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7996)
Moshe Kaplan discovered that there is no check that the provided
 colormap is not larger than 256 entries in the WPG reader which may
 cause denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-7997](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7997)
Moshe Kaplan discovered that an assertion is thrown for some files in
 the WPG reader due to a logic error which may cause denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-8682](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8682)
Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a stack buffer read overflow
 while reading the SCT header which may cause denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-8683](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8683)
Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in the
 PCX coder which may cause denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-8684](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8684)
Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in the
 SGI coder which may cause denial of service.
* [CVE-2016-9830](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9830)
Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in
 MagickRealloc() function which may cause denial of service.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.20-3+deb8u2.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems (with the
exception of [CVE-2016-9830](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9830)) have been fixed in version 1.3.25-5.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.25-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.
