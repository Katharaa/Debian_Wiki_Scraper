-----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
03 Oct 2016
Affected Packages:

[libdbd-mysql-perl](https://packages.debian.org/src:libdbd-mysql-perl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-1246](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1246).  

More information:

Pali Rohar discovered that libdbd-mysql-perl, the Perl DBI database
driver for MySQL and MariaDB, constructed an error message in a
fixed-length buffer, leading to a crash (\_FORTIFY\_SOURCE failure) and,
potentially, to denial of service.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.028-2+deb8u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your libdbd-mysql-perl packages.
