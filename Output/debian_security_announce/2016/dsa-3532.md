More information:

Kostya Kortchinsky discovered a stack-based buffer overflow
vulnerability in the VPNv4 NLRI parser in bgpd in quagga, a BGP/OSPF/RIP
routing daemon. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (daemon crash), or potentially, execution of arbitrary
code, if bgpd is configured with BGP peers enabled for VPNv4.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.99.22.4-1+wheezy2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99.23.1-1+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.
