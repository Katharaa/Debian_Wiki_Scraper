More information:

RÃ©gis Leroy from Makina Corpus discovered that varnish, a caching HTTP
reverse proxy, is vulnerable to HTTP smuggling issues, potentially
resulting in cache poisoning or bypassing of access control policies.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.0.2-2+deb7u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your varnish packages.
