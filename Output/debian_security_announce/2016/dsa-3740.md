-----------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 830195](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=830195).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-2119](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2119), [CVE-2016-2123](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2123), [CVE-2016-2125](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2125), [CVE-2016-2126](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2126).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2016-2119](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2119)
Stefan Metzmacher discovered that client-side SMB2/3 required
 signing can be downgraded, allowing a man-in-the-middle attacker to
 impersonate a server being connected to by Samba, and return
 malicious results.
* [CVE-2016-2123](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2123)
Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative and Frederic Besler discovered
 that the routine ndr\_pull\_dnsp\_name, used to parse data from the
 Samba Active Directory ldb database, contains an integer overflow
 flaw, leading to an attacker-controlled memory overwrite. An
 authenticated user can take advantage of this flaw for remote
 privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2016-2125](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2125)
Simo Sorce of Red Hat discovered that the Samba client code always
 requests a forwardable ticket when using Kerberos authentication. A
 target server, which must be in the current or trusted domain/realm,
 is given a valid general purpose Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket
 (TGT), which can be used to fully impersonate the authenticated user
 or service.
* [CVE-2016-2126](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2126)
Volker Lendecke discovered several flaws in the Kerberos PAC
 validation. A remote, authenticated, attacker can cause the winbindd
 process to crash using a legitimate Kerberos ticket due to incorrect
 handling of the PAC checksum. A local service with access to the
 winbindd privileged pipe can cause winbindd to cache elevated access
 permissions.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.2.14+dfsg-0+deb8u2. In addition, this update contains
several changes originally targeted for the upcoming jessie point
release.


We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
