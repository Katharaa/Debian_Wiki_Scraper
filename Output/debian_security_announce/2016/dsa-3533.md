More information:

Kashyap Thimmaraju and Bhargava Shastry discovered a remotely
triggerable buffer overflow vulnerability in openvswitch, a production
quality, multilayer virtual switch implementation. Specially crafted
MPLS packets could overflow the buffer reserved for MPLS labels in an
OVS internal data structure. A remote attacker can take advantage of
this flaw to cause a denial of service, or potentially, execution of
arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.0+git20140819-3+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
