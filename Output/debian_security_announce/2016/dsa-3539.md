DSA-3539-1 srtp -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
02 Apr 2016
Affected Packages:

[srtp](https://packages.debian.org/src:srtp)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 807698](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=807698).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-6360](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6360).  

More information:

Randell Jesup and the Firefox team discovered that srtp, Cisco's
reference implementation of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
(SRTP), does not properly handle RTP header CSRC count and extension
header length. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash
an application linked against libsrtp, resulting in a denial of service.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.4.4+20100615~dfsg-2+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5~20130609~dfsg-1.1+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your srtp packages.
