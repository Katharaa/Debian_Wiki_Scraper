---------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[xen](https://packages.debian.org/src:xen)

Vulnerable:

Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-7092](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7092), [CVE-2016-7094](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7094), [CVE-2016-7154](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7154).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:


* [CVE-2016-7092](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7092) (XSA-185)
 Jeremie Boutoille of Quarkslab and Shangcong Luan of Alibaba
 discovered a flaw in the handling of L3 pagetable entries, allowing
 a malicious 32-bit PV guest administrator can escalate their
 privilege to that of the host.
* [CVE-2016-7094](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7094) (XSA-187)
 x86 HVM guests running with shadow paging use a subset of the x86
 emulator to handle the guest writing to its own pagetables. Andrew
 Cooper of Citrix discovered that there are situations a guest can
 provoke which result in exceeding the space allocated for internal
 state. A malicious HVM guest administrator can cause Xen to fail a
 bug check, causing a denial of service to the host.
* [CVE-2016-7154](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7154) (XSA-188)
 Mikhail Gorobets of Advanced Threat Research, Intel Security
 discovered a use after free flaw in the FIFO event channel code. A
 malicious guest administrator can crash the host, leading to a
 denial of service. Arbitrary code execution (and therefore privilege
 escalation), and information leaks, cannot be excluded.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.1-9+deb8u7.


We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.
