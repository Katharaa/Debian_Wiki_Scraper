[gnutls26](https://packages.debian.org/src:gnutls26)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-7575](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7575).  

More information:

Karthikeyan Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent at INRIA discovered a flaw in
the TLS 1.2 protocol which could allow the MD5 hash function to be used
for signing ServerKeyExchange and Client Authentication packets during a
TLS handshake. A man-in-the-middle attacker could exploit this flaw to
conduct collision attacks to impersonate a TLS server or an
authenticated TLS client.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.12.20-8+deb7u5.


We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.
