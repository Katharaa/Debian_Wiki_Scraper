More information:

It was discovered that polarssl, a library providing SSL and TLS
support, contained two heap-based buffer overflows that could allow a
remote attacker to trigger denial of service (via application crash)
or arbitrary code execution.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.9-1~deb7u6.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.9-2.1+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.
