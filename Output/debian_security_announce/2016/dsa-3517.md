DSA-3517-1 exim4 -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
14 Mar 2016
Affected Packages:

[exim4](https://packages.debian.org/src:exim4)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-1531](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1531).  

More information:

A local root privilege escalation vulnerability was found in Exim,
Debian's default mail transfer agent, in configurations using the
perl\_startup option (Only Exim via exim4-daemon-heavy enables Perl
support).


To address the vulnerability, updated Exim versions clean the complete
execution environment by default, affecting Exim and subprocesses such
as transports calling other programs, and thus may break existing
installations. New configuration options (keep\_environment,
add\_environment) were introduced to adjust this behavior.
