DSA-3703-1 bind9 -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
01 Nov 2016
Affected Packages:

[bind9](https://packages.debian.org/src:bind9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 842858](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=842858).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-8864](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8864).  

More information:

Tony Finch and Marco Davids reported an assertion failure in BIND, a
DNS server implementation, which causes the server process to
terminate. This denial-of-service vulnerability is related to a
defect in the processing of responses with DNAME records from
authoritative servers and primarily affects recursive resolvers.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u8.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
