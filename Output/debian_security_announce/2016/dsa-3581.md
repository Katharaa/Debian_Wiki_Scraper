Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3581-1 libndp -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
17 May 2016
Affected Packages:

[libndp](https://packages.debian.org/src:libndp)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 824545](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=824545).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-3698](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3698).  

More information:

Julien Bernard discovered that libndp, a library for the IPv6 Neighbor
Discovery Protocol, does not properly perform input and origin checks
during the reception of a NDP message. An attacker in a non-local
network could use this flaw to advertise a node as a router, and cause a
denial of service attack, or act as a man-in-the-middle.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-2+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libndp packages.
