Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3488-1 libssh -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
23 Feb 2016
Affected Packages:

[libssh](https://packages.debian.org/src:libssh)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 815663](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=815663).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-0739](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0739).  

More information:

Aris Adamantiadis discovered that libssh, a tiny C SSH library,
incorrectly generated a short ephemeral secret for the
diffie-hellman-group1 and diffie-hellman-group14 key exchange methods.
The resulting secret is 128 bits long, instead of the recommended sizes
of 1024 and 2048 bits respectively. This flaw could allow an
eavesdropper with enough resources to decrypt or intercept SSH sessions.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.4-1+deb7u3. This update also includes fixes for
[CVE-2014-8132](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8132)
and [CVE-2015-3146](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3146),
which were previously scheduled for the next wheezy point release.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.3-4+deb8u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your libssh packages.
