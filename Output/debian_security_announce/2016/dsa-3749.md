Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 848830](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=848830).

More information:

Gjoko Krstic of Zero Science Labs discovered that dcmtk, a collection
of libraries implementing the DICOM standard, did not properly handle
the size of data received from the network. This could lead to
denial-of-service (via application crash) or arbitrary code execution.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.0-15+deb8u1.


For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 3.6.1~20160216-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your dcmtk packages.
