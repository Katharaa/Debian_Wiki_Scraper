========================


DSA-3643-1 kde4libs -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
06 Aug 2016
Affected Packages:

[kde4libs](https://packages.debian.org/src:kde4libs)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 832620](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=832620).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-6232](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6232).  

More information:

Andreas Cord-Landwehr discovered that kde4libs, the core libraries
for all KDE 4 applications, do not properly handle the extraction
of archives with "../" in the file paths. A remote attacker can
take advantage of this flaw to overwrite files outside of the
extraction folder, if a user is tricked into extracting a specially
crafted archive.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:4.14.2-5+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:4.14.22-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your kde4libs packages.
