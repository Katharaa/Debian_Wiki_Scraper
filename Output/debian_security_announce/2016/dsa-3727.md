More information:

Cisco Talos discovered that hdf5, a file format and library for
storing scientific data, contained several vulnerabilities that could
lead to arbitrary code execution when handling untrusted data.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.13+docs-15+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch) and unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.10.0-patch1+docs-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your hdf5 packages.
