More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the resolver in nginx, a
small, powerful, scalable web/proxy server, leading to denial of service
or, potentially, to arbitrary code execution. These only affect nginx if
the resolver directive is used in a configuration file.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.1-2.2+wheezy4.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.2-5+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.9.10-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.10-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.
