Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3441-1 perl -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
11 Jan 2016
Affected Packages:

[perl](https://packages.debian.org/src:perl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 810719](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=810719).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-8607](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8607).  

More information:

David Golden of MongoDB discovered that File::Spec::canonpath() in Perl
returned untainted strings even if passed tainted input. This defect
undermines taint propagation, which is sometimes used to ensure that
unvalidated user input does not reach sensitive code.


The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not affected by this problem.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.20.2-3+deb8u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.
