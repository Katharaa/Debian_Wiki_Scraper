In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-6321](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6321).  

More information:

Harry Sintonen discovered that GNU tar does not properly handle member
names containing '..', thus allowing an attacker to bypass the path
names specified on the command line and replace files and directories in
the target directory.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.27.1-2+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.29b-1.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your tar packages.
