Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3487-1 libssh2 -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
23 Feb 2016
Affected Packages:

[libssh2](https://packages.debian.org/src:libssh2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 815662](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=815662).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-0787](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0787).  

More information:

Andreas Schneider reported that libssh2, a SSH2 client-side library,
passes the number of bytes to a function that expects number of bits
during the SSHv2 handshake when libssh2 is to get a suitable value for
group order in the Diffie-Hellman negotiation. This weakens
significantly the handshake security, potentially allowing an
eavesdropper with enough resources to decrypt or intercept SSH sessions.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.4.2-1.1+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.3-4.1+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libssh2 packages.
