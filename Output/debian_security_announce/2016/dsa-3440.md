Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3440-1 sudo -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
11 Jan 2016
Affected Packages:

[sudo](https://packages.debian.org/src:sudo)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 804149](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=804149).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-5602](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5602).  

More information:

When sudo is configured to allow a user to edit files under a directory
that they can already write to without using sudo, they can actually
edit (read and write) arbitrary files. Daniel Svartman reported that a
configuration like this might be introduced unintentionally if the
editable files are specified using wildcards, for example:



```
operator ALL=(root) sudoedit /home/*/*/test.txt
```

The default behaviour of sudo has been changed so that it does not allow
editing of a file in a directory that the user can write to, or that is
reached by following a symlink in a directory that the user can write
to. These restrictions can be disabled, but this is strongly
discouraged.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.8.5p2-1+nmu3+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.10p3-1+deb8u3.


For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.8.15-1.1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.15-1.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.
