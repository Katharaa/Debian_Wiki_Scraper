Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3626-1 openssh -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 Jul 2016
Affected Packages:

[openssh](https://packages.debian.org/src:openssh)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 831902](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=831902).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-6210](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6210).  

More information:

Eddie Harari reported that the OpenSSH SSH daemon allows user
enumeration through timing differences when trying to authenticate
users. When sshd tries to authenticate a non-existing user, it will pick
up a fixed fake password structure with a hash based on the Blowfish
algorithm. If real users passwords are hashed using SHA256/SHA512, then
a remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw by sending large
passwords, receiving shorter response times from the server for
non-existing users.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:6.7p1-5+deb8u3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:7.2p2-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.
