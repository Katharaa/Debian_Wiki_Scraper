Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-3158](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3158), [CVE-2016-3159](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3159), [CVE-2016-3960](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3960).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:


* [CVE-2016-3158](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3158),
[CVE-2016-3159](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3159) (XSA-172)
 Jan Beulich from SUSE discovered that Xen does not properly handle
 writes to the hardware FSW.ES bit when running on AMD64 processors.
 A malicious domain can take advantage of this flaw to obtain address
 space usage and timing information, about another domain, at a
 fairly low rate.
* [CVE-2016-3960](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3960) (XSA-173)
 Ling Liu and Yihan Lian of the Cloud Security Team, Qihoo 360
 discovered an integer overflow in the x86 shadow pagetable code. A
 HVM guest using shadow pagetables can cause the host to crash. A PV
 guest using shadow pagetables (i.e. being migrated) with PV
 superpages enabled (which is not the default) can crash the host, or
 corrupt hypervisor memory, potentially leading to privilege
 escalation.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.1-9+deb8u5.


We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.
