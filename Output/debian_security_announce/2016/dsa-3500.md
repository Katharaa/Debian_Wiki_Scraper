Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-0702](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0702), [CVE-2016-0705](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0705), [CVE-2016-0797](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0797), [CVE-2016-0798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0798), [CVE-2016-0799](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0799), [CVE-2016-2842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2842).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Socket Layer
toolkit.


* [CVE-2016-0702](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0702)
Yuval Yarom from the University of Adelaide and NICTA, Daniel Genkin
 from Technion and Tel Aviv University, and Nadia Heninger from the
 University of Pennsylvania discovered a side-channel attack which
 makes use of cache-bank conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge
 microarchitecture. This could allow local attackers to recover RSA
 private keys.
* [CVE-2016-0705](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0705)
Adam Langley from Google discovered a double free bug when parsing
 malformed DSA private keys. This could allow remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service or memory corruption in applications
 parsing DSA private keys received from untrusted sources.
* [CVE-2016-0797](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0797)
Guido Vranken discovered an integer overflow in the BN\_hex2bn and
 BN\_dec2bn functions that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and
 heap corruption. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service or memory corruption in applications processing hex or
 dec data received from untrusted sources.
* [CVE-2016-0798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0798)
Emilia KÃ¤sper of the OpenSSL development team discovered a memory
 leak in the SRP database lookup code. To mitigate the memory leak,
 the seed handling in SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user is now disabled even if
 the user has configured a seed. Applications are advised to migrate
 to the SRP\_VBASE\_get1\_by\_user function.
* [CVE-2016-0799](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0799),
[CVE-2016-2842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2842)
Guido Vranken discovered an integer overflow in the BIO\_\*printf
 functions that could lead to an OOB read when printing very long
 strings. Additionally the internal doapr\_outch function can attempt
 to write to an arbitrary memory location in the event of a memory
 allocation failure. These issues will only occur on platforms where
 sizeof(size\_t)> sizeof(int) like many 64 bit systems. This could
 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or memory
 corruption in applications that pass large amounts of untrusted data
 to the BIO\_\*printf functions.


Additionally the EXPORT and LOW ciphers were disabled since thay could
be used as part of the DROWN
([CVE-2016-0800](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0800))
and SLOTH
([CVE-2015-7575](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7575))
attacks, but note that the oldstable (wheezy) and stable (jessie)
distributions are not affected by those attacks since the SSLv2 protocol
has already been dropped in the openssl package version 1.0.0c-2.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u20.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1k-3+deb8u4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed shortly.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
