More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in wordpress, a web blogging
tool, which could allow remote attackers to compromise a site via
cross-site scripting, bypass restrictions, obtain sensitive
revision-history information, or mount a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1+dfsg-1+deb8u9.


We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.
