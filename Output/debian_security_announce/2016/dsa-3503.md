More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, information
leak or data loss.


* [CVE-2013-4312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4312),
[CVE-2016-2847](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2847)
Tetsuo Handa discovered that users can use pipes queued on local
 (Unix) sockets to allocate an unfair share of kernel memory, leading
 to denial-of-service (resource exhaustion).


This issue was previously mitigated for the stable suite by limiting
 the total number of files queued by each user on local sockets. The
 new kernel version in both suites includes that mitigation plus
 limits on the total size of pipe buffers allocated for each user.
* [CVE-2015-7566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7566)
Ralf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported that the visor
 driver crashes when a specially crafted USB device without bulk-out
 endpoint is detected.
* [CVE-2015-8767](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8767)
An SCTP denial-of-service was discovered which can be triggered by a
 local attacker during a heartbeat timeout event after the 4-way
 handshake.
* [CVE-2015-8785](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8785)
It was discovered that local users permitted to write to a file on a
 FUSE filesystem could cause a denial of service (unkillable loop in
 the kernel).
* [CVE-2015-8812](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8812)
A flaw was found in the iw\_cxgb3 Infiniband driver. Whenever it
 could not send a packet because the network was congested, it would
 free the packet buffer but later attempt to send the packet again.
 This use-after-free could result in a denial of service (crash or
 hang), data loss or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2015-8816](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8816)
A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the USB hub driver.
 This may be used by a physically present user for privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2015-8830](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8830)
Ben Hawkes of Google Project Zero reported that the AIO interface
 permitted reading or writing 2 GiB of data or more in a single
 chunk, which could lead to an integer overflow when applied to
 certain filesystems, socket or device types. The full security
 impact has not been evaluated.
* [CVE-2016-0723](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0723)
A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the TIOCGETD ioctl.
 A local attacker could use this flaw for denial-of-service.
* [CVE-2016-0774](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0774)
It was found that the fix for [CVE-2015-1805](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1805) in kernel versions older
 than Linux 3.16 did not correctly handle the case of a partially
 failed atomic read. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw
 to crash the system or leak kernel memory to user space.
* [CVE-2016-2069](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2069)
Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in flushing of the TLB
 when switching tasks on an x86 system. On an SMP system this could
 possibly lead to a crash, information leak or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2016-2384](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2384)
Andrey Konovalov found that a crafted USB MIDI device with an
 invalid USB descriptor could trigger a double-free. This may be used
 by a physically present user for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2016-2543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2543)
Dmitry Vyukov found that the core sound sequencer driver (snd-seq)
 lacked a necessary check for a null pointer, allowing a user
 with access to a sound sequencer device to cause a denial-of service (crash).
* [CVE-2016-2544](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2544),
[CVE-2016-2546](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2546),
[CVE-2016-2547](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2547),
[CVE-2016-2548](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2548)
Dmitry Vyukov found various race conditions in the sound subsystem
 (ALSA)'s management of timers. A user with access to sound devices
 could use these to cause a denial-of-service (crash or hang) or
 possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2016-2545](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2545)
Dmitry Vyukov found a flaw in list manipulation in the sound
 subsystem (ALSA)'s management of timers. A user with access to sound
 devices could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash or hang)
 or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2016-2549](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2549)
Dmitry Vyukov found a potential deadlock in the sound subsystem
 (ALSA)'s use of high resolution timers. A user with access to sound
 devices could use this to cause a denial-of-service (hang).
* [CVE-2016-2550](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2550)
The original mitigation of
 [CVE-2013-4312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4312),
 limiting the total number
 of files a user could queue on local sockets, was flawed. A user
 given a local socket opened by another user, for example through the
 systemd socket activation mechanism, could make use of the other
 user's quota, again leading to a denial-of-service (resource
 exhaustion). This is fixed by accounting queued files to the sender
 rather than the socket opener.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.73-2+deb7u3. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not
affected by [CVE-2015-8830](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8830).


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u4. [CVE-2013-4312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4312), [CVE-2015-7566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7566), [CVE-2015-8767](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8767) and
[CVE-2016-0723](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0723) were already fixed in DSA-3448-1. [CVE-2016-0774](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0774) does not
affect the stable distribution.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
