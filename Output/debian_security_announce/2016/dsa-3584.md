More information:

Gustavo Grieco discovered several flaws in the way librsvg, a SAX-based
renderer library for SVG files, parses SVG files with circular
definitions. A remote attacker can take advantage of these flaws to
cause an application using the librsvg library to crash.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.40.5-1+deb8u2.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.40.12-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.40.12-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your librsvg packages.
