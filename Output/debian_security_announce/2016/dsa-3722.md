========================


DSA-3722-1 vim -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
22 Nov 2016
Affected Packages:

[vim](https://packages.debian.org/src:vim)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-1248](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1248).  

More information:

Florian Larysch and Bram Moolenaar discovered that vim, an enhanced vi
editor, does not properly validate values for the filetype,
syntax and keymap options, which may result in the execution of
arbitrary code if a file with a specially crafted modeline is opened.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:7.4.488-7+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.
