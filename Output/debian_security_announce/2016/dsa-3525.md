DSA-3525-1 pixman -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
22 Mar 2016
Affected Packages:

[pixman](https://packages.debian.org/src:pixman)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-9766](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9766).  

More information:

Vincent LE GARREC discovered an integer overflow in pixman, a
pixel-manipulation library for X and cairo. A remote attacker can
exploit this flaw to cause an application using the pixman library to
crash, or potentially, to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running the application.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.26.0-4+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), the testing distribution (stretch)
and the unstable distribution (sid), this problem was already fixed in
version 0.32.6-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your pixman packages.
