DSA-3514-1 samba -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
12 Mar 2016
Affected Packages:

[samba](https://packages.debian.org/src:samba)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 812429](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=812429).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-7560](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7560), [CVE-2016-0771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0771).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2015-7560](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7560)
Jeremy Allison of Google, Inc. and the Samba Team discovered that
 Samba incorrectly handles getting and setting ACLs on a symlink
 path. An authenticated malicious client can use SMB1 UNIX extensions
 to create a symlink to a file or directory, and then use non-UNIX
 SMB1 calls to overwrite the contents of the ACL on the file or
 directory linked to.
* [CVE-2016-0771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0771)
Garming Sam and Douglas Bagnall of Catalyst IT discovered that Samba
 is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read issue during DNS TXT record
 handling, if Samba is deployed as an AD DC and chosen to run the
 internal DNS server. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to
 cause a denial of service (Samba crash), or potentially, to allow
 leakage of memory from the server in the form of a DNS TXT reply.


Additionally this update includes a fix for a regression introduced due
to the upstream fix for [CVE-2015-5252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5252) in DSA-3433-1 in setups where the
share path is '/'.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u7. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not
affected by [CVE-2016-0771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0771).


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.17+dfsg-2+deb8u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.3.6+dfsg-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
