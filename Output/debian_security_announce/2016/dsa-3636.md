Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3636-1 collectd -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 Jul 2016
Affected Packages:

[collectd](https://packages.debian.org/src:collectd)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 832507](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=832507), [Bug 832577](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=832577).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-6254](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6254).  

More information:

Emilien Gaspar discovered that collectd, a statistics collection and
monitoring daemon, incorrectly processed incoming network
packets. This resulted in a heap overflow, allowing a remote attacker
to either cause a DoS via application crash, or potentially execute
arbitrary code.


Additionally, security researchers at Columbia University and the
University of Virginia discovered that collectd failed to verify a
return value during initialization. This meant the daemon could
sometimes be started without the desired, secure settings.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.1-6+deb8u1.


For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 5.5.2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your collectd packages.
