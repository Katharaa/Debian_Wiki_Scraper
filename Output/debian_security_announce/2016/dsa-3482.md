DSA-3482-1 libreoffice -- security update
-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
17 Feb 2016
Affected Packages:

[libreoffice](https://packages.debian.org/src:libreoffice)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-0794](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0794), [CVE-2016-0795](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0795).  

More information:

An anonymous contributor working with VeriSign iDefense Labs
discovered that libreoffice, a full-featured office productivity
suite, did not correctly handle Lotus WordPro files. This would enable
an attacker to crash the program, or execute arbitrary code, by
supplying a specially crafted LWP file.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:3.5.4+dfsg2-0+deb7u6.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.3.3-2+deb8u3.


For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 1:5.0.5~rc1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libreoffice packages.
