DSA-3597-1 expat -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Jun 2016
Affected Packages:

[expat](https://packages.debian.org/src:expat)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-6702](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6702), [CVE-2016-5300](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5300).  

More information:

Two related issues have been discovered in Expat, a C library for parsing
XML.


* [CVE-2012-6702](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6702)
It was introduced when
 [CVE-2012-0876](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0876)
 was addressed. Stefan SÃ¸rensen discovered that the use of the function
 XML\_Parse() seeds the random number generator generating repeated outputs
 for rand() calls.
* [CVE-2016-5300](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5300)
It is the product of an incomplete solution for
 [CVE-2012-0876](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0876).
 The parser poorly seeds the random number generator allowing an attacker to
 cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via an XML file with crafted
 identifiers.


You might need to manually restart programs and services using expat
libraries.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.0-6+deb8u3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.1-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.
