DSA-3659-1 linux -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
04 Sep 2016
Affected Packages:

[linux](https://packages.debian.org/src:linux)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-5696](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5696), [CVE-2016-6136](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6136), [CVE-2016-6480](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6480), [CVE-2016-6828](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6828).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or have other
impacts.


* [CVE-2016-5696](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5696)
Yue Cao, Zhiyun Qian, Zhongjie Wang, Tuan Dao, and Srikanth V.
 Krishnamurthy of the University of California, Riverside; and Lisa
 M. Marvel of the United States Army Research Laboratory discovered
 that Linux's implementation of the TCP Challenge ACK feature
 results in a side channel that can be used to find TCP connections
 between specific IP addresses, and to inject messages into those
 connections.


Where a service is made available through TCP, this may allow
 remote attackers to impersonate another connected user to the
 server or to impersonate the server to another connected user. In
 case the service uses a protocol with message authentication
 (e.g. TLS or SSH), this vulnerability only allows denial of
 service (connection failure). An attack takes tens of seconds, so
 short-lived TCP connections are also unlikely to be vulnerable.


This may be mitigated by increasing the rate limit for TCP
 Challenge ACKs so that it is never exceeded:
 sysctl net.ipv4.tcp\_challenge\_ack\_limit=1000000000
* [CVE-2016-6136](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6136)
Pengfei Wang discovered that the audit subsystem has a
 'double-fetch' or TOCTTOU bug in its handling of special
 characters in the name of an executable. Where audit logging of
 execve() is enabled, this allows a local user to generate
 misleading log messages.
* [CVE-2016-6480](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6480)
Pengfei Wang discovered that the aacraid driver for Adaptec RAID
 controllers has a 'double-fetch' or TOCTTOU bug in its
 validation of FIB messages passed through the ioctl() system
 call. This has no practical security impact in current Debian
 releases.
* [CVE-2016-6828](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6828)
Marco Grassi reported a 'use-after-free' bug in the TCP
 implementation, which can be triggered by local users. The
 security impact is unclear, but might include denial of service or
 privilege escalation.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.36-1+deb8u1. In addition, this update contains several
changes originally targeted for the upcoming jessie point release.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
