DSA-3709-1 libxslt -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
08 Nov 2016
Affected Packages:

[libxslt](https://packages.debian.org/src:libxslt)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 842570](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=842570).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-4738](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4738).  

More information:

Nick Wellnhofer discovered that the xsltFormatNumberConversion function
in libxslt, an XSLT processing runtime library, does not properly check
for a zero byte terminating the pattern string. This flaw can be
exploited to leak a couple of bytes after the buffer that holds the
pattern string.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.28-2+deb8u2.


For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.1.29-2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.29-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your libxslt packages.
