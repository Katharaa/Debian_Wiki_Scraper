Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3701-1 nginx -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
25 Oct 2016
Affected Packages:

[nginx](https://packages.debian.org/src:nginx)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2016-1247](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1247).  

More information:

Dawid Golunski reported the nginx web server packages in Debian
suffered from a privilege escalation vulnerability (www-data to root)
due to the way log files are handled. This security update changes
ownership of the /var/log/nginx directory root. In addition,
/var/log/nginx has to be made accessible to local users, and local
users may be able to read the log files themselves local until the
next logrotate invocation.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.2-5+deb8u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.
