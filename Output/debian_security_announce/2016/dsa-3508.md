More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in JasPer, a library for
manipulating JPEG-2000 files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2016-1577](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1577)
Jacob Baines discovered a double-free flaw in the
 jas\_iccattrval\_destroy function. A remote attacker could exploit
 this flaw to cause an application using the JasPer library to crash,
 or potentially, to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
 user running the application.
* [CVE-2016-2089](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2089)
The Qihoo 360 Codesafe Team discovered a NULL pointer dereference
 flaw within the jas\_matrix\_clip function. A remote attacker could
 exploit this flaw to cause an application using the JasPer library
 to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service.
* [CVE-2016-2116](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2116)
Tyler Hicks discovered a memory leak flaw in the
 jas\_iccprof\_createfrombuf function. A remote attacker could exploit
 this flaw to cause the JasPer library to consume memory, resulting
 in a denial-of-service.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.900.1-13+deb7u4.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.900.1-debian1-2.4+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.
