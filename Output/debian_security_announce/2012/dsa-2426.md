More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in GIMP, the GNU Image
Manipulation Program.


* [CVE-2010-4540](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4540)
Stack-based buffer overflow in the load\_preset\_response
 function in plug-ins/lighting/lighting-ui.c in the LIGHTING
 EFFECTS & LIGHT plugin allows user-assisted remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
 execute arbitrary code via a long Position field in a plugin
 configuration file.
* [CVE-2010-4541](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4541)
Stack-based buffer overflow in the loadit function in
 plug-ins/common/sphere-designer.c in the SPHERE DESIGNER
 plugin allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
 code via a long Number of lights field in a plugin
 configuration file.
* [CVE-2010-4542](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4542)
Stack-based buffer overflow in the gfig\_read\_parameter\_gimp\_rgb
 function in the GFIG plugin allows user-assisted remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a long Foreground field in a
 plugin configuration file.
* [CVE-2010-4543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4543)
Heap-based buffer overflow in the read\_channel\_data function in
 file-psp.c in the Paint Shop Pro (PSP) plugin allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a PSP\_COMP\_RLE (aka RLE
 compression) image file that begins a long run count at the end
 of the image.
* [CVE-2011-1782](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1782)
The correction for [CVE-2010-4543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4543) was incomplete.
* [CVE-2011-2896](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2896)
The LZW decompressor in the LZWReadByte function in
 plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c does not properly handle code
 words that are absent from the decompression table when
 encountered, which allows remote attackers to trigger an
 infinite loop or a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly
 execute arbitrary code, via a crafted compressed stream.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.10-1+squeeze3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.6.11-5.


We recommend that you upgrade your gimp packages.
