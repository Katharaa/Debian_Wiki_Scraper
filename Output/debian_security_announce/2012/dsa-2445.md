More information:

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the TYPO3 web
content management framework:


* [CVE-2012-1606](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1606)
Failing to properly HTML-encode user input in several places,
 the TYPO3 backend is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting. A
 valid backend user is required to exploit these
 vulnerabilities.
* [CVE-2012-1607](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1607)
Accessing a CLI Script directly with a browser may disclose
 the database name used for the TYPO3 installation.
* [CVE-2012-1608](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1608)
By not removing non printable characters, the API method
 t3lib\_div::RemoveXSS() fails to filter specially crafted HTML
 injections, thus is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.9+dfsg1-1+squeeze3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 4.5.14+dfsg1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your typo3-src packages.
