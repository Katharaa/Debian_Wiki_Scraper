More information:

De Eindbazen discovered that PHP, when run with mod\_cgi, will
interpret a query string as command line parameters, allowing to
execute arbitrary code.


Additionally, this update fixes insufficient validation of upload
name which lead to corrupted $\_FILES indices.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze9.


The testing distribution (wheezy) will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.3-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
