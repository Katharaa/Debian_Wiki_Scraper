Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2424-1 libxml-atom-perl -- XML external entity expansion
------------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
04 Mar 2012
Affected Packages:

[libxml-atom-perl](https://packages.debian.org/src:libxml-atom-perl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
No other external database security references currently available.
More information:

It was discovered that the XML::Atom Perl module did not disable
external entities when parsing XML from potentially untrusted sources.
This may allow attackers to gain read access to otherwise protected
resources, depending on how the library is used.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.37-1+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.39-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libxml-atom-perl packages.
