More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2009-4307](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4307)
Nageswara R Sastry reported an issue in the ext4 filesystem. Local users
 with the privileges to mount a filesystem can cause a denial of service
 (BUG) by providing a s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex value greater than 31.
* [CVE-2011-1833](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1833)
Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered an information
 leak in the eCryptfs filesystem. Local users were able to mount arbitrary
 directories.
* [CVE-2011-4347](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4347)
Sasha Levin reported an issue in the device assignment functionality in
 KVM. Local users with permission to access /dev/kvm could assign unused pci
 devices to a guest and cause a denial of service (crash).
* [CVE-2012-0045](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0045)
Stephan Barwolf reported an issue in KVM. Local users in a 32-bit guest
 running on a 64-bit system can crash the guest with a syscall instruction.
* [CVE-2012-1090](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1090)
CAI Qian reported an issue in the CIFS filesystem. A reference count leak
 can occur during the lookup of special files, resulting in a denial of
 service (oops) on umount.
* [CVE-2012-1097](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1097)
H. Peter Anvin reported an issue in the regset infrastructure. Local users
 can cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by triggering the
 write methods of readonly regsets.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-41squeeze2.


The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:





|  | Debian 6.0 (squeeze) |
| --- | --- |
| user-mode-linux | 2.6.32-1um-4+41squeeze2 |



We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
