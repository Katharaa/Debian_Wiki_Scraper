Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2478-1 sudo -- parsing error
--------------------------------



Date Reported:
23 May 2012
Affected Packages:

[sudo](https://packages.debian.org/src:sudo)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-2337](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2337).  

More information:

It was discovered that sudo misparsed network masks used in Host and
Host\_List stanzas. This allowed the execution of commands on hosts,
where the user would not be allowed to run the specified command.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.4p4-2.squeeze.3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.
