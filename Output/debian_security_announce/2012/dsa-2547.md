========================


DSA-2547-1 bind9 -- improper assert
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
12 Sep 2012
Affected Packages:

[bind9](https://packages.debian.org/src:bind9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-4244](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4244).  

More information:

It was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, does not handle DNS records
properly which approach size limits inherent to the DNS protocol. An
attacker could use crafted DNS records to crash the BIND server
process, leading to a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze7.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
