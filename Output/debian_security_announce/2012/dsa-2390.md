---------------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[openssl](https://packages.debian.org/src:openssl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-4108](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4108), [CVE-2011-4109](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4109), [CVE-2011-4354](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4354), [CVE-2011-4576](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4576), [CVE-2011-4619](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4619).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, an implementation
of TLS and related protocols. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:


* [CVE-2011-4108](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4108)
The DTLS implementation performs a MAC check only if certain
 padding is valid, which makes it easier for remote attackers
 to recover plaintext via a padding oracle attack.
* [CVE-2011-4109](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4109)
A double free vulnerability when X509\_V\_FLAG\_POLICY\_CHECK is
 enabled, allows remote attackers to cause applications crashes
 and potentially allow execution of arbitrary code by
 triggering failure of a policy check.
* [CVE-2011-4354](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4354)
On 32-bit systems, the operations on NIST elliptic curves
 P-256 and P-384 are not correctly implemented, potentially
 leaking the private ECC key of a TLS server. (Regular
 RSA-based keys are not affected by this vulnerability.)
* [CVE-2011-4576](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4576)
The SSL 3.0 implementation does not properly initialize data
 structures for block cipher padding, which might allow remote
 attackers to obtain sensitive information by decrypting the
 padding data sent by an SSL peer.
* [CVE-2011-4619](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4619)
The Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) implementation in OpenSSL
 does not properly handle handshake restarts, unnecessarily
 simplifying CPU exhaustion attacks.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.9.8g-15+lenny15.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.9.8o-4squeeze5.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.0.0f-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
