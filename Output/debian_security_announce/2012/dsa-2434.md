========================


DSA-2434-1 nginx -- sensitive information leak
----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
19 Mar 2012
Affected Packages:

[nginx](https://packages.debian.org/src:nginx)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 664137](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=664137).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-1180](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1180).  

More information:

Matthew Daley discovered a memory disclosure vulnerability in nginx. In
previous versions of this web server, an attacker can receive the content of
previously freed memory if an upstream server returned a specially crafted HTTP
response, potentially exposing sensitive information.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.67-3+squeeze2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.17-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.
