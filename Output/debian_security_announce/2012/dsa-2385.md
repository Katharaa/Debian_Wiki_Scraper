Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-0206](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0206).  

More information:

Ray Morris discovered that the PowerDNS authoritative server responds
to response packets. An attacker who can spoof the source address of
IP packets can cause an endless packet loop between a PowerDNS
authoritative server and another DNS server, leading to a denial of
service.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.21.2-1+lenny1.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.22-8+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.
