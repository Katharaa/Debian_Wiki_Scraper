ModSecurity, a security module for the Apache webserver. In situations where

present in HTTP headers, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass
policy and execute cross-site script (XSS) attacks through properly crafted
HTML documents.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.12-1+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
