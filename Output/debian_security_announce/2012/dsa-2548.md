More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Tor, an online privacy
tool.


* [CVE-2012-3518](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3518)
Avoid an uninitialised memory read when reading a vote or consensus
 document that has an unrecognized flavour name. This could lead to
 a remote crash, resulting in denial of service.
* [CVE-2012-3519](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3519)
Try to leak less information about what relays a client is choosing to
 a side-channel attacker.
* [CVE-2012-4419](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4419)
By providing specially crafted date strings to a victim tor instance,
 an attacker can cause it to run into an assertion and shut down.


Additionally the update to stable includes the following fixes:
 when waiting for a client to renegotiate, don't allow it to add any
 bytes to the input buffer. This fixes a potential DoS issue
[[tor-5934](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5934),
[tor-6007](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6007)].



For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.2.2.39-1.


For the unstable distribution, these problems have been fixed in version
0.2.3.22-rc-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.
