----------------------------------



Date Reported:
16 Dec 2012
Affected Packages:

[tiff](https://packages.debian.org/src:tiff)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 694693](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=694693).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-5581](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5581).  

More information:

The tiff library for handling TIFF image files contained a stack-based
buffer overflow, potentially allowing attackers who can submit such
files to a vulnerable system to execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze8.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 4.0.2-1 of the tiff
package, and version 3.9.6-10 of the tiff3 package.


We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.
