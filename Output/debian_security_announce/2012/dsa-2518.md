DSA-2518-1 krb5 -- denial of service and remote code execution
--------------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
31 Jul 2012
Affected Packages:

[krb5](https://packages.debian.org/src:krb5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 683429](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=683429).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-1014](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1014), [CVE-2012-1015](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1015).  

More information:

Emmanuel Bouillon from NCI Agency discovered multiple vulnerabilities in MIT
Kerberos, a daemon implementing the network authentication protocol.


* [CVE-2012-1014](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1014)
By sending specially crafted AS-REQ (Authentication Service Request) to a KDC
 (Key Distribution Center), an attacker could make it free an uninitialized
 pointer, corrupting the heap. This can lead to process crash or even arbitrary
 code execution.


This CVE only affects testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions.
* [CVE-2012-1015](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1015)
By sending specially crafted AS-REQ to a KDC, an attacker could make it
 dereference an uninitialized pointer, leading to process crash or even
 arbitrary code execution


In both cases, arbitrary code execution is believed to be difficult to achieve,
but might not be impossible.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.3+dfsg-4squeeze6.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.1+dfsg-2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.1+dfsg-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.
