More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform.


* [CVE-2011-3377](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3377)
The IcedTea browser plugin included in the openjdk-6 package
 does not properly enforce the Same Origin Policy on web content
 served under a domain name which has a common suffix with the
 required domain name.
* [CVE-2011-3563](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3563)
The Java Sound component did not properly check for array
 boundaries. A malicious input or an untrusted Java application
 or applet could use this flaw to cause Java Virtual Machine to
 crash or disclose portion of its memory.
* [CVE-2011-5035](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-5035)
The OpenJDK embedded web server did not guard against an
 excessive number of a request parameters, leading to a denial
 of service vulnerability involving hash collisions.
* [CVE-2012-0497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0497)
It was discovered that Java2D did not properly check graphics
 rendering objects before passing them to the native renderer.
 This could lead to JVM crash or Java sandbox bypass.
* [CVE-2012-0501](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0501)
The ZIP central directory parser used by java.util.zip.ZipFile
 entered an infinite recursion in native code when processing a
 crafted ZIP file, leading to a denial of service.
* [CVE-2012-0502](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0502)
A flaw was found in the AWT KeyboardFocusManager class that
 could allow untrusted Java applets to acquire keyboard focus
 and possibly steal sensitive information.
* [CVE-2012-0503](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0503)
The java.util.TimeZone.setDefault() method lacked a security
 manager invocation, allowing an untrusted Java application or
 applet to set a new default time zone.
* [CVE-2012-0505](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0505)
The Java serialization code leaked references to serialization
 exceptions, possibly leaking critical objects to untrusted
 code in Java applets and applications.
* [CVE-2012-0506](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0506)
It was discovered that CORBA implementation in Java did not
 properly protect repository identifiers (that can be obtained
 using \_ids() method) on certain Corba objects. This could
 have been used to perform modification of the data that should
 have been immutable.
* [CVE-2012-0507](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0507)
The AtomicReferenceArray class implementation did not properly
 check if the array is of an expected Object[] type. A
 malicious Java application or applet could use this flaw to
 cause Java Virtual Machine to crash or bypass Java sandbox
 restrictions.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.13-0+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 6b24-1.11.1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.
