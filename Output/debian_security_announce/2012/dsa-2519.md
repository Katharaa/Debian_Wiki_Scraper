More information:

Several security vulnerabilities affecting ISC dhcpd, a server for
automatic IP address assignment, have been discovered. Additionally, the
latest security update for isc-dhcp, [DSA-2516-1](https://www.debian.org/security/dsa-2516),
did not properly apply the patches for
[CVE-2012-3571](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3571)
and
[CVE-2012-3954](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3954).
This has been addressed
in this additional update.


* [CVE-2011-4539](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4539)
BlueCat Networks discovered that it is possible to crash DHCP servers
 configured to evaluate requests with regular expressions via crafted
 DHCP request packets.
* [CVE-2012-3571](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3571)
Markus Hietava of the Codenomicon CROSS project discovered that it is
 possible to force the server to enter an infinite loop via messages with
 malformed client identifiers.
* [CVE-2012-3954](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3954)
Glen Eustace discovered that DHCP servers running in DHCPv6 mode
 and possibly DHCPv4 mode suffer of memory leaks while processing messages.
 An attacker can use this flaw to exhaust resources and perform denial
 of service attacks.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-P1-15+squeeze6.


For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.
