More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in Gnash, the GNU Flash
player.


* [CVE-2012-1175](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1175)
Tielei Wang from Georgia Tech Information Security Center discovered a
 vulnerability in GNU Gnash which is caused due to an integer overflow
 error and can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by
 tricking a user into opening a specially crafted SWF file.
* [CVE-2011-4328](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4328)
Alexander Kurtz discovered an unsafe management of HTTP cookies. Cookie
 files are stored under /tmp and have predictable names, and the vulnerability
 allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files the users has
 write permissions for, and are also world-readable which may cause
 information leak.
* [CVE-2010-4337](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4337)
Jakub Wilk discovered an unsafe management of temporary files during the
 build process. Files are stored under /tmp and have predictable names, and the
 vulnerability allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files
 the users has write permissions for.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.8-5+squeeze1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-5.


We recommend that you upgrade your gnash packages.
