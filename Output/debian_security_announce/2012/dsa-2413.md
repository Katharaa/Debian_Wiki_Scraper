DSA-2413-1 libarchive -- buffer overflows
-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
20 Feb 2012
Affected Packages:

[libarchive](https://packages.debian.org/src:libarchive)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-1777](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1777), [CVE-2011-1778](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1778).  

More information:

Two buffer overflows have been discovered in libarchive, a library
providing a flexible interface for reading and writing archives in
various formats. The possible buffer overflows while reading ISO 9660
or tar streams allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code depending on the application that makes use of this functionality.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.4-1+squeeze1.


For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions,
this problem has been fixed in version 2.8.5-5.


We recommend that you upgrade your libarchive packages.
