========================


DSA-2571-1 libproxy -- buffer overflow
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
04 Nov 2012
Affected Packages:

[libproxy](https://packages.debian.org/src:libproxy)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-4505](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4505).  

More information:

The Red Hat Security Response Team discovered that libproxy, a library
for automatic proxy configuration management, applied insufficient
validation to the Content-Length header sent by a server providing a
proxy.pac file. Such remote server could trigger an integer overflow
and consequently overflow an in-memory buffer.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.1-2+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.3.1-5.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libproxy packages.
