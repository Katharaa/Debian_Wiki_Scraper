Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-4086](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4086), [CVE-2012-0879](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0879), [CVE-2012-1601](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1601), [CVE-2012-2123](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2123), [CVE-2012-2133](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2133).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2011-4086](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4086)
Eric Sandeen reported an issue in the journaling layer for ext4 filesystems
 (jbd2). Local users can cause buffers to be accessed after they have been
 torn down, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) due to a system crash.
* [CVE-2012-0879](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0879)
Louis Rilling reported two reference counting issues in the CLONE\_IO
 feature of the kernel. Local users can prevent io context structures
 from being freed, resulting in a denial of service.
* [CVE-2012-1601](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1601)
Michael Ellerman reported an issue in the KVM subsystem. Local users could
 cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by creating VCPUs
 before a call to KVM\_CREATE\_IRQCHIP.
* [CVE-2012-2123](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2123)
Steve Grubb reported an issue in fcaps, a filesystem-based capabilities
 system. Personality flags set using this mechanism, such as the disabling
 of address space randomization, may persist across suid calls.
* [CVE-2012-2133](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2133)
Shachar Raindel discovered a use-after-free bug in the hugepages
 quota implementation. Local users with permission to use hugepages
 via the hugetlbfs implementation may be able to cause a denial of
 service (system crash).


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-44. Updates are currently only available for the amd64, i386 and sparc
ports.



**Note**: updated linux-2.6 packages will also be made available in the release
of Debian 6.0.5, scheduled to take place the weekend of 2012.05.12. This
pending update will be version 2.6.32-45, and provides an additional fix for
build failures on some architectures. Users for whom this update is not
critical, and who may wish to avoid multiple reboots, should consider waiting
for the 6.0.5 release before updating, or installing the 2.6.32-45 version
ahead of time from proposed-updates.


The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:





|  | Debian 6.0 (squeeze) |
| --- | --- |
| user-mode-linux | 2.6.32-1um-4+44 |



We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
