Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-4430](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4430).

It was discovered that bacula, a network backup service, does not
properly enforce console ACLs. This could allow information about
resources to be dumped by an otherwise-restricted client.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.2-2.2+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your bacula packages.
