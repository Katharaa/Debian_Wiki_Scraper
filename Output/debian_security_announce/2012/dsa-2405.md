-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
06 Feb 2012
Affected Packages:

[apache2](https://packages.debian.org/src:apache2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-3607](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3607), [CVE-2011-3368](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3368), [CVE-2011-3639](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3639), [CVE-2011-4317](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4317), [CVE-2012-0031](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0031), [CVE-2012-0053](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0053).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:


* [CVE-2011-3607](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3607):
 An integer overflow in ap\_pregsub() could allow local attackers to
 execute arbitrary code at elevated privileges via crafted .htaccess
 files.
* [CVE-2011-3368](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3368) [CVE-2011-3639](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3639) [CVE-2011-4317](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4317):
 The Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the request URI for
 proxied requests. In certain reverse proxy configurations using the
 ProxyPassMatch directive or using the RewriteRule directive with the
 [P] flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy connect to an
 arbitrary server. This could allow the attacker to access internal
 servers that are not otherwise accessible from the outside.


The three CVE ids denote slightly different variants of the same
 issue.


Note that, even with this issue fixed, it is the responsibility of
 the administrator to ensure that the regular expression replacement
 pattern for the target URI does not allow a client to append arbitrary
 strings to the host or port parts of the target URI. For example, the
 configuration



```

  ProxyPassMatch ^/mail(.*)  http://internal-host$1

```

is still insecure and should be replaced by one of the following
 configurations:



```

  ProxyPassMatch ^/mail(/.*)  http://internal-host$1
  ProxyPassMatch ^/mail/(.*)  http://internal-host/$1

```
* [CVE-2012-0031](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0031):
 An apache2 child process could cause the parent process to crash
 during shutdown. This is a violation of the privilege separation
 between the apache2 processes and could potentially be used to worsen
 the impact of other vulnerabilities.
* [CVE-2012-0053](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0053):
 The response message for error code 400 (bad request) could be used to
 expose httpOnly cookies. This could allow a remote attacker using
 cross site scripting to steal authentication cookies.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version apache2 2.2.9-10+lenny12.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version apache2 2.2.16-6+squeeze6


For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.2.22-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.


This update also contains updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which have
been recompiled against the updated apache2 packages. The new version
number for the oldstable distribution is 2.2.6-02-1+lenny7. In the
stable distribution, apache2-mpm-itk has the same version number as
apache2.
