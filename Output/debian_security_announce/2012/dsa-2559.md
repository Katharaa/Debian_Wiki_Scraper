More information:

Several vulnerabilities were found in libexif, a library used to parse EXIF
meta-data on camera files.


* [CVE-2012-2812](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2812):
 A heap-based out-of-bounds array read in the exif\_entry\_get\_value
 function allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
 obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via an image
 with crafted EXIF tags.
* [CVE-2012-2813](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2813):
 A heap-based out-of-bounds array read in the exif\_convert\_utf16\_to\_utf8
 function allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
 obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via an image
 with crafted EXIF tags.
* [CVE-2012-2814](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2814):
 A buffer overflow in the exif\_entry\_format\_value function allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code
 via an image with crafted EXIF tags.
* [CVE-2012-2836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2836):
 A heap-based out-of-bounds array read in the exif\_data\_load\_data function
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly obtain
 potentially sensitive information from process memory via an image with
 crafted EXIF tags.
* [CVE-2012-2837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2837):
 A divide-by-zero error in the mnote\_olympus\_entry\_get\_value function
 while formatting EXIF maker note tags allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service via an image with crafted EXIF tags.
* [CVE-2012-2840](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2840):
 An off-by-one error in the exif\_convert\_utf16\_to\_utf8 function allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute
 arbitrary code via an image with crafted EXIF tags.
* [CVE-2012-2841](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2841):
 An integer underflow in the exif\_entry\_get\_value function can cause a
 heap overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution while formatting an
 EXIF tag, if the function is called with a buffer size parameter equal to
 zero or one.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.19-1+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.20-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.20-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your libexif packages.
