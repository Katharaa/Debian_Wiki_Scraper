DSA-2473-1 openoffice.org -- buffer overflow
--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
16 May 2012
Affected Packages:

[openoffice.org](https://packages.debian.org/src:openoffice.org)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-1149](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1149).  

More information:

Tielei Wang discovered that OpenOffice.org does not allocate a large
enough memory region when processing a specially crafted JPEG object,
leading to a heap-based buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code
execution.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.2.1-11+squeeze5.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1:3.4.5-1 of the
libreoffice package.


We recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.
