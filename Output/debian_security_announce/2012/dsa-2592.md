Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2592-1 elinks -- programming error
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
28 Dec 2012
Affected Packages:

[elinks](https://packages.debian.org/src:elinks)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-4545](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4545).  

More information:

Marko Myllynen discovered that ELinks, a powerful text-mode browser,
incorrectly delegates user credentials during GSS-Negotiate.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12~pre5-2+squeeze1. Since the initial Squeeze release,
XULRunner needed to be updated and the version currently in the archive
is incompatible with ELinks. As such, JavaScript support needed to be
disabled (only a small subset of typical functionality was supported
anyway). It will likely be re-enabled in a later point update.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12~pre5-9.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12~pre5-9.


We recommend that you upgrade your elinks packages.
