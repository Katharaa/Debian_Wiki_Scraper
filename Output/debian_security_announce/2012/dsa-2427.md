More information:

Two security vulnerabilities related to EXIF processing were
discovered in ImageMagick, a suite of programs to manipulate images.


* [CVE-2012-0247](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0247)
When parsing a maliciously crafted image with incorrect offset
 and count in the ResolutionUnit tag in EXIF IFD0, ImageMagick
 writes two bytes to an invalid address.
* [CVE-2012-0248](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0248)
Parsing a maliciously crafted image with an IFD whose all IOP
 tags value offsets point to the beginning of the IFD itself
 results in an endless loop and a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 8:6.6.0.4-3+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 8:6.6.9.7-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.
