Affected Packages:

[php5](https://packages.debian.org/src:php5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-1938](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1938), [CVE-2011-2483](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2483), [CVE-2011-4566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4566), [CVE-2011-4885](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4885), [CVE-2012-0057](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0057).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, the web scripting
language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following issues:


* [CVE-2011-1938](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1938)
The UNIX socket handling allowed attackers to trigger a buffer overflow
 via a long path name.
* [CVE-2011-2483](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2483)
The crypt\_blowfish function did not properly handle 8-bit characters,
 which made it easier for attackers to determine a cleartext password
 by using knowledge of a password hash.
* [CVE-2011-4566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4566)
When used on 32 bit platforms, the exif extension could be used to
 trigger an integer overflow in the exif\_process\_IFD\_TAG function
 when processing a JPEG file.
* [CVE-2011-4885](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4885)
It was possible to trigger hash collisions predictably when parsing
 form parameters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service by sending many crafted parameters.
* [CVE-2012-0057](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0057)
When applying a crafted XSLT transform, an attacker could write files
 to arbitrary places in the filesystem.


NOTE: the fix for
[CVE-2011-2483](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2483)
required changing the behaviour of this function: it is now incompatible with
some old (wrongly) generated hashes for passwords containing 8-bit characters.
See the package NEWS entry for details. This change has not been applied to the
Lenny version of PHP.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny15.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.3.3-7+squeeze6.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 5.3.9-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
