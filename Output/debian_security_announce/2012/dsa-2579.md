-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 Nov 2012
Affected Packages:

[apache2](https://packages.debian.org/src:apache2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 689936](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=689936).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-4557](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4557), [CVE-2012-4929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4929).  

More information:

A vulnerability has been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:


* [CVE-2012-4557](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4557)
A flaw was found when mod\_proxy\_ajp connects to a backend
 server that takes too long to respond. Given a specific
 configuration, a remote attacker could send certain requests,
 putting a backend server into an error state until the retry
 timeout expired. This could lead to a temporary denial of
 service.


In addition, this update also adds a server side mitigation for the
following issue:


* [CVE-2012-4929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4929)
If using SSL/TLS data compression with HTTPS in an connection
 to a web browser, man-in-the-middle attackers may obtain
 plaintext HTTP headers. This issue is known as the CRIME
 attack. This update of apache2 disables SSL compression by
 default. A new SSLCompression directive has been backported
 that may be used to re-enable SSL data compression in
 environments where the CRIME attack is not an issue.
 For more information, please refer to the [SSLCompression
 Directive documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslcompression).


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.16-6+squeeze10.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-12.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-12.


We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
