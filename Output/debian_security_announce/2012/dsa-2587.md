In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-5526](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5526).  

More information:

It was discovered that the CGI module for Perl does not filter LF
characters in the Set-Cookie and P3P headers, potentially allowing
attackers to inject HTTP headers.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.61-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your libcgi-pm-perl packages.
