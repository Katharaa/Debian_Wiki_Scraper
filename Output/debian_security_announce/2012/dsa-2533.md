More information:

It was discovered that Performance Co-Pilot (pcp), a framework for
performance monitoring, contains several vulnerabilities.


* [CVE-2012-3418](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3418)
Multiple buffer overflows in the PCP protocol decoders can
 cause PCP clients and servers to crash or, potentially,
 execute arbitrary code while processing crafted PDUs.
* [CVE-2012-3419](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3419)
The linux PMDA used by the pmcd daemon discloses sensitive
 information from the /proc file system to unauthenticated
 clients.
* [CVE-2012-3420](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3420)
Multiple memory leaks processing crafted requests can cause
 pmcd to consume large amounts of memory and eventually crash.
* [CVE-2012-3421](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3421)
Incorrect event-driven programming allows malicious clients to
 prevent other clients from accessing the pmcd daemon.


To address the information disclosure vulnerability,
[CVE-2012-3419](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3419), a
new proc PMDA was introduced, which is disabled by default. If you
need access to this information, you need to enable the proc PMDA.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.3-squeeze2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.5.


We recommend that you upgrade your pcp packages.
