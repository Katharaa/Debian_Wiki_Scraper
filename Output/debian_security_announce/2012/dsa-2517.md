Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2517-1 bind9 -- denial of service
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 Jul 2012
Affected Packages:

[bind9](https://packages.debian.org/src:bind9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-3817](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3817).  

More information:

Einar Lonn discovered that under certain conditions bind9, a DNS server,
may use cached data before initialization. As a result, an attacker can
trigger an assertion failure on servers under high query load that do
DNSSEC validation.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze6.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.1.dfsg.P1-4.2.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
