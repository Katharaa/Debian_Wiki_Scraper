Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-0213](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0213).  

More information:

It was discovered that Apache POI, a Java implementation of the
Microsoft Office file formats, would allocate arbitrary amounts of
memory when processing crafted documents. This could impact the
stability of the Java virtual machine.

version 3.6+dfsg-1+squeeze1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libjakarta-poi-java packages.
