Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-1761](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1761), [CVE-2011-2911](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2911), [CVE-2011-2912](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2912), [CVE-2011-2913](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2913), [CVE-2011-2914](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2914), [CVE-2011-2915](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2915).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities that can lead to the execution of arbitrary code
have been discovered in libmodplug, a library for MOD music based on
ModPlug. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following issues:


* [CVE-2011-1761](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1761)
epiphant discovered that the abc file parser is vulnerable to several
 stack-based buffer overflows that potentially lead to the execution
 of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2011-2911](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2911)
Hossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadWav
 function is vulnerable to an integer overflow which leads to a
 heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker can exploit this flaw to
 potentially execute arbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening
 crafted WAV files.
* [CVE-2011-2912](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2912)
Hossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadS3M
 function is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker
 can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code by
 tricking a victim into opening crafted S3M files.
* [CVE-2011-2913](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2913)
Hossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadAMS
 function suffers from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to
 memory corruption. An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially
 execute arbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening crafted AMS
 files.
* [CVE-2011-2914](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2914)
It was discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadDSM function suffers
 from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to memory corruption.
 An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary
 code by tricking a victim into opening crafted DSM files.
* [CVE-2011-2915](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2915)
It was discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadAMS2 function suffers
 from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to memory corruption.
 An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary
 code by tricking a victim into opening crafted AMS files.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.8.8.1-1+squeeze2.


For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
has been fixed in version 1:0.8.8.4-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libmodplug packages.
