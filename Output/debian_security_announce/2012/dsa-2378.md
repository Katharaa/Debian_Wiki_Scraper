More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in FFmpeg, a multimedia

for QDM2, VP5, VP6, VMD and SVQ1 files could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.5.6-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.7.3-1 of the libav source package.


We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.
