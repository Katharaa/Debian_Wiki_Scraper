Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-1948](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1948), [CVE-2012-1950](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1950), [CVE-2012-1954](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1954), [CVE-2012-1966](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1966), [CVE-2012-1967](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1967).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, a web browser
based on Firefox. The included XULRunner library provides rendering services for
several other applications included in Debian.


* [CVE-2012-1948](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1948)
Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, and Bill McCloskey
 identified several memory safety problems that may lead to the execution of
 arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2012-1950](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1950)
Mario Gomes and Code Audit Labs discovered that it is possible to force
 Iceweasel to display the URL of the previous entered site through drag and
 drop actions to the address bar. This can be abused to perform phishing
 attacks.
* [CVE-2012-1954](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1954)
Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free problem in
 nsDocument::AdoptNode that may lead to the execution of arbitrary
 code.
* [CVE-2012-1966](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1966)
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 discovered that it is possible to perform cross-site
 scripting attacks through the context menu when using data: URLs.
* [CVE-2012-1967](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1967)
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 discovered that in certain cases, javascript: URLs can
 be executed so that scripts can escape the JavaScript sandbox and run
 with elevated privileges.


Note: We'd like to advise users of Iceweasel's 3.5 branch in Debian stable to
consider to upgrade to the Iceweasel 10.0 ESR (Extended Support Release) which
is now available in Debian Backports. Although Debian will continue to support
Iceweasel 3.5 in stable with security updates, this can only be done on a best
effort basis as upstream provides no such support anymore. On top of that, the
10.0 branch adds proactive security features to the browser.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.16-17.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 10.0.6esr-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
