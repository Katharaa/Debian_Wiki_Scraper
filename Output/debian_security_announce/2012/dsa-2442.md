Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2442-2 openarena -- UDP traffic amplification
-------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
31 Mar 2012
Affected Packages:

[openarena](https://packages.debian.org/src:openarena)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 665656](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=665656).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2010-5077](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-5077).  

More information:

It has been discovered that spoofed getstatus UDP requests are being
sent by attackers to servers for use with games derived from the
Quake 3 engine (such as openarena). These servers respond with a
packet flood to the victim whose IP address was impersonated by the
attackers, causing a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.5-5+squeeze3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.8.5-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your openarena packages.
