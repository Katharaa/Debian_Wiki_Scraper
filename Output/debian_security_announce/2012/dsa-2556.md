More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Icedove, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client.


This includes several instances of use-after-free and buffer overflow
issues. The reported vulnerabilities could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, and additionally to the bypass of content-loading
restrictions via the location object.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze13.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 10.0.7-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 10.0.7-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
