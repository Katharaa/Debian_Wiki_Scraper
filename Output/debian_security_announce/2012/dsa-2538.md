Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2538-1 moin -- privilege escalation
---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
05 Sep 2012
Affected Packages:

[moin](https://packages.debian.org/src:moin)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-4404](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4404).  

More information:

It was discovered that Moin, a Python clone of WikiWiki, incorrectly
evaluates ACLs when virtual groups are involved. This may allow certain
users to have additional permissions (privilege escalation) or lack
expected permissions.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.3-1+squeeze2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.4-8.


We recommend that you upgrade your moin packages.
