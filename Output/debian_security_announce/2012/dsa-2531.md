DSA-2531-1 xen -- Denial of Service
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Aug 2012
Affected Packages:

[xen](https://packages.debian.org/src:xen)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 683279](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=683279).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-3432](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3432), [CVE-2012-3433](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3433).  

More information:

Several denial-of-service vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen,
the popular virtualization software. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2012-3432](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3432)
Guest mode unprivileged code, which has been granted the privilege to
 access MMIO regions, may leverage that access to crash the whole guest.
 Since this can be used to crash a client from within, this vulnerability is
 considered to have low impact.
* [CVE-2012-3433](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3433)
A guest kernel can cause the host to become unresponsive for a period
 of time, potentially leading to a DoS. Since an attacker with full
 control in the guest can impact the host, this vulnerability is
 considered to have high impact.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.1-5.3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.3-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.
