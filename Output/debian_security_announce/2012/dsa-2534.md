DSA-2534-1 postgresql-8.4 -- several vulnerabilities
----------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
25 Aug 2012
Affected Packages:

[postgresql-8.4](https://packages.debian.org/src:postgresql-8.4)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-3488](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3488), [CVE-2012-3489](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3489).  

More information:

Two vulnerabilities related to XML processing were discovered in
PostgreSQL, an SQL database.


* [CVE-2012-3488](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3488)
contrib/xml2's xslt\_process() can be used to read and write
 external files and URLs.
* [CVE-2012-3489](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3489)
xml\_parse() fetches external files or URLs to resolve DTD and
 entity references in XML values.


This update removes the problematic functionality, potentially
breaking applications which use it in a legitimate way.


Due to the nature of these vulnerabilities, it is possible that
attackers who have only indirect access to the database can supply
crafted XML data which exploits this vulnerability.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 8.4.13-0squeeze1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.1.5-1 of the postgresql-9.1 package.


We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-8.4 packages.
