More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2011-2183](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2183)
Andrea Righi reported an issue in KSM, a memory-saving de-duplication
 feature. By exploiting a race with exiting tasks, local users can cause
 a kernel oops, resulting in a denial of service.
* [CVE-2011-2213](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2213)
Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the INET socket monitoring interface.
 Local users could cause a denial of service by injecting code and causing
 the kernel to execute an infinite loop.
* [CVE-2011-2898](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2898)
Eric Dumazet reported an information leak in the raw packet socket
 implementation.
* [CVE-2011-3353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3353)
Han-Wen Nienhuys reported a local denial of service issue in the FUSE
 (Filesystem in Userspace) support in the Linux kernel. Local users could
 cause a buffer overflow, leading to a kernel oops and resulting in a denial
 of service.
* [CVE-2011-4077](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4077)
Carlos Maiolino reported an issue in the XFS filesystem. A local user
 with the ability to mount a filesystem could corrupt memory resulting
 in a denial of service or possibly gain elevated privileges.
* [CVE-2011-4110](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4110)
David Howells reported an issue in the kernel's access key retention
 system which allow local users to cause a kernel oops leading to a denial
 of service.
* [CVE-2011-4127](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4127)
Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat reported an issue in the ioctl passthrough
 support for SCSI devices. Users with permission to access restricted
 portions of a device (e.g. a partition or a logical volume) can obtain
 access to the entire device by way of the SG\_IO ioctl. This could be
 exploited by a local user or privileged VM guest to achieve a privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2011-4611](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4611)
Maynard Johnson reported an issue with the perf support on POWER7 systems
 that allows local users to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2011-4622](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4622)
Jan Kiszka reported an issue in the KVM PIT timer support. Local users
 with the permission to use KVM can cause a denial of service by starting
 a PIT timer without first setting up the irqchip.
* [CVE-2011-4914](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4914)
Ben Hutchings reported various bounds checking issues within the ROSE
 protocol support in the kernel. Remote users could possibly use this
 to gain access to sensitive memory or cause a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-39squeeze1. Updates for issues impacting the oldstable distribution
(lenny) will be available soon.


The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:





|  | Debian 6.0 (squeeze) |
| --- | --- |
| user-mode-linux | 2.6.32-1um-4+39squeeze1 |



We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
