 arbitrary code.

Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free problem in
 nsDocument::AdoptNode that may lead to the execution of arbitrary
 code.
* [CVE-2012-1967](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1967)
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 discovered that in certain cases, javascript: URLs
 can be executed so that scripts can escape the JavaScript sandbox and run
 with elevated privileges. This can lead to arbitrary code
 execution.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-14.

will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.
