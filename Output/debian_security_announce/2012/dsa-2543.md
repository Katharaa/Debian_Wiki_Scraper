Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-3515](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3515), [CVE-2012-4411](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4411).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in xen-qemu-dm-4.0, the Xen
QEMU Device Model virtual machine hardware emulator. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2012-3515](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3515):
 The device model for HVM domains does not properly handle VT100
 escape sequences when emulating certain devices with a virtual
 console backend. An attacker within a guest with access to the
 vulnerable virtual console could overwrite memory of the device
 model and escalate privileges to that of the device model process.
* [CVE-2012-4411](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4411):
 The QEMU monitor was enabled by default, allowing administrators of
 a guest to access resources of the host, possibly escalate privileges
 or access resources belonging to another guest.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.1-2+squeeze2.


The testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid),
no longer contain this package.


We recommend that you upgrade your xen-qemu-dm-4.0 packages.
