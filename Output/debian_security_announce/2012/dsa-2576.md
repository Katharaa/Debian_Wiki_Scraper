Andy Lutomirski discovered that tcsd (the TPM userspace daemon) was missing
input validation. Using carefully crafted input, it can lead to a denial of
service by making the daemon crash with a segmentation fault.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.5-2+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
