Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2440-1 libtasn1-3 -- missing bounds check
---------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 Mar 2012
Affected Packages:

[libtasn1-3](https://packages.debian.org/src:libtasn1-3)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-1569](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1569).  

More information:

Matthew Hall discovered that many callers of the asn1\_get\_length\_der
function did not check the result against the overall buffer length
before processing it further. This could result in out-of-bounds
memory accesses and application crashes. Applications using GNUTLS
are exposed to this issue.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-1+squeeze+1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-3 packages.
