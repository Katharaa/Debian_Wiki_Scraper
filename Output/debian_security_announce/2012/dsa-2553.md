More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, a web

rendering services for several other applications included in Debian.


The reported vulnerabilities could lead to the execution of arbitrary

object.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.16-18.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
