Date Reported:
27 Feb 2012
Affected Packages:

[puppet](https://packages.debian.org/src:puppet)

More information:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Puppet, a centralized
configuration management tool.


* [CVE-2012-1053](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1053)
Puppet runs execs with an unintended group privileges,
 potentially leading to privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2012-1054](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1054)
The k5login type writes to untrusted locations,
 enabling local users to escalate their privileges
 if the k5login type is used.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.6.2-5+squeeze4.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.7.11-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.
