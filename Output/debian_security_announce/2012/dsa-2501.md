More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Xen, a hypervisor.


* [CVE-2012-0217](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0217)
Xen does not properly handle uncanonical return addresses on
 Intel amd64 CPUs, allowing amd64 PV guests to elevate to
 hypervisor privileges. AMD processors, HVM and i386 guests
 are not affected.
* [CVE-2012-0218](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0218)
Xen does not properly handle SYSCALL and SYSENTER instructions
 in PV guests, allowing unprivileged users inside a guest
 system to crash the guest system.
* [CVE-2012-2934](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2934)
Xen does not detect old AMD CPUs affected by AMD Erratum #121.


For [CVE-2012-2934](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2934),
Xen refuses to start domUs on affected systems
unless the allow\_unsafe option is passed.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.1-5.2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version
4.1.3~rc1+hg-20120614.a9c0a89c08f2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.
