========================


DSA-2557-1 hostapd -- buffer overflow
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
08 Oct 2012
Affected Packages:

[hostapd](https://packages.debian.org/src:hostapd)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-4445](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4445).  

More information:

Timo Warns discovered that the internal authentication server of hostapd,
a user space IEEE 802.11 AP and IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP Authenticator,
is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing fragmented EAP-TLS
messages. As a result, an internal overflow checking routine terminates
the process. An attacker can abuse this flaw to conduct denial of service
attacks via crafted EAP-TLS messages prior to any authentication.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.6.10-2+squeeze1.


For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your hostapd packages.
