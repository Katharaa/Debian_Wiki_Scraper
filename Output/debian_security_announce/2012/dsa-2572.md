More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceape, an internet
suite based on Seamonkey:


* [CVE-2012-3982](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3982)
Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine
 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
 corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
 arbitrary code via unknown vectors.
* [CVE-2012-3986](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3986)
Icedove does not properly restrict calls to DOMWindowUtils
 methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
 access restrictions via crafted JavaScript code.
* [CVE-2012-3990](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3990)
A Use-after-free vulnerability in the IME State Manager
 implementation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
 code via unspecified vectors, related to the
 nsIContent::GetNameSpaceID function.
* [CVE-2012-3991](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3991)
Icedove does not properly restrict JSAPI access to the
 GetProperty function, which allows remote attackers to bypass
 the Same Origin Policy and possibly have unspecified other
 impact via a crafted web site.
* [CVE-2012-4179](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4179)
A use-after-free vulnerability in the
 nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn function allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
 service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.
* [CVE-2012-4180](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4180)
A heap-based buffer overflow in the
 nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace function allows
 remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified
 vectors.
* [CVE-2012-4182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4182)
A use-after-free vulnerability in the
 nsTextEditRules::WillInsert function allows remote attackers
 to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
 memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.
* [CVE-2012-4186](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4186)
A heap-based buffer overflow in the
 nsWav-eReader::DecodeAudioData function allows remote attackers
 to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.
* [CVE-2012-4188](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4188)
A heap-based buffer overflow in the Convolve3x3 function
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
 unspecified vectors.


Additionally, this update fixes a regression in the patch for
[CVE-2012-3959](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3959),
released in [DSA-2554-1](https://www.debian.org/security/2012/dsa-2554).


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.11-16.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.10esr-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.10esr-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.
