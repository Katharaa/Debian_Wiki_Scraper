DSA-2436-1 libapache2-mod-fcgid -- inactive resource limits
-----------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
19 Mar 2012
Affected Packages:

[libapache2-mod-fcgid](https://packages.debian.org/src:libapache2-mod-fcgid)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 615814](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=615814).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-1181](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1181).  

More information:

It was discovered that the Apache FCGID module, a FastCGI implementation,
did not properly enforce the FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass resource limit,
rendering this control ineffective and potentially allowing a virtual
host to consume excessive resources.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.6-1+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.6-1.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-fcgid packages.
