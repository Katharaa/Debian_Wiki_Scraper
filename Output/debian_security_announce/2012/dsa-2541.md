========================


DSA-2541-1 beaker -- information disclosure
-------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Sep 2012
Affected Packages:

[beaker](https://packages.debian.org/src:beaker)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 684890](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=684890).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-3458](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3458).  

More information:

It was discovered that Beaker, a cache and session library for Python,
when using the python-crypto backend, is vulnerable to information
disclosure due to a cryptographic weakness related to the use of the
AES cipher in ECB mode.


Systems that have the python-pycryptopp package should not be
vulnerable, as this backend is preferred over python-crypto.


After applying this update, existing sessions will be invalidated.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.4-4+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.6.3-1.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your beaker packages.
