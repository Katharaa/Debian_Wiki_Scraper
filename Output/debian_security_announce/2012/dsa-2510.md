Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 678737](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=678737).

More information:

John Leitch has discovered a vulnerability in eXtplorer, a very feature
rich web server file manager, which can be exploited by malicious people
to conduct cross-site request forgery attacks.


The vulnerability allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests
without performing any validity checks to verify the request. This can be
exploited for example, to create an administrative user account by tricking
an logged administrator to visiting an attacker-defined web link.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0b6+dfsg.2-1+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0b6+dfsg.3-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0b6+dfsg.3-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your extplorer packages.
