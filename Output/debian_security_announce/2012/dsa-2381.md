Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-4096](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4096).  

More information:

It was discovered that the IPv6 support code in Squid does not
properly handle certain DNS responses, resulting in deallocation of an
invalid pointer and a daemon crash.


The squid package and the version of SquidÂ 3 shipped in lenny lack IPv6
support and are not affected by this issue.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.6-1.2+squeeze2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 3.1.18-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.
