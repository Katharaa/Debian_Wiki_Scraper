Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-3670](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3670), [CVE-2012-0442](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0442), [CVE-2012-0444](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0444), [CVE-2012-0449](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0449).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, Debian's
variant of the Mozilla Thunderbird code base.


* [CVE-2011-3670](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3670)
Icedove does not not properly enforce the IPv6 literal address
 syntax, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information by making XMLHttpRequest calls through a proxy and
 reading the error messages.
* [CVE-2012-0442](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0442)
Memory corruption bugs could cause Icedove to crash or
 possibly execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2012-0444](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0444)
Icedove does not properly initialize nsChildView data
 structures, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted Ogg Vorbis file.
* [CVE-2012-0449](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0449)
Icedove allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
 arbitrary code via a malformed XSLT stylesheet that is
 embedded in a document.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze7.


We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
