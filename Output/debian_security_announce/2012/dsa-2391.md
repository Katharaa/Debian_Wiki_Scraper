Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a tool
to administer MySQL over the web. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2011-4107](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4107)
The XML import plugin allowed a remote attacker to read arbitrary
 files via XML data containing external entity references.

Cross site scripting was possible in the table tracking feature,
 allowing a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by these problems.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 4:3.3.7-7.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 4:3.4.7.1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.
