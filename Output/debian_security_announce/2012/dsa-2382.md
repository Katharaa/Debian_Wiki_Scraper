More information:

Several problems have been discovered in eCryptfs, a cryptographic
filesystem for Linux.


* [CVE-2011-1831](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1831)
Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs
 incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local
 attacker could use this flaw to mount to arbitrary locations, leading
 to privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2011-1832](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1832)
Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs
 incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local
 attacker could use this flaw to unmount to arbitrary locations, leading
 to a denial of service.
* [CVE-2011-1834](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1834)
Dan Rosenberg and Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly
 handled modifications to the mtab file when an error occurs. A local
 attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file, and possibly
 unmount arbitrary locations, leading to a denial of service.
* [CVE-2011-1835](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1835)
Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled keys when
 setting up an encrypted private directory. A local attacker could use
 this flaw to manipulate keys during creation of a new user.
* [CVE-2011-1837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1837)
Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled
 lock counters. A local attacker could use this flaw to possibly overwrite
 arbitrary files.


We acknowledge the work of the Ubuntu distribution in preparing patches
suitable for near-direct inclusion in the Debian package.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 68-1+lenny1.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 83-4+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 95-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ecryptfs-utils packages.
