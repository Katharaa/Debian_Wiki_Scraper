Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2539-1 zabbix -- SQL injection
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
06 Sep 2012
Affected Packages:

[zabbix](https://packages.debian.org/src:zabbix)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 683273](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=683273).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-3435](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3435).  

More information:

It was discovered that Zabbix, a network monitoring solution, does not
properly validate user input used as a part of an SQL query. This may
allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands (SQL
injection) and possibly escalate privileges.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.8.2-1squeeze4.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.0.2+dfsg-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your zabbix packages.
