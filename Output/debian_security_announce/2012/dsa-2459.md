Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-0249](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0249), [CVE-2012-0250](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0250), [CVE-2012-0255](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0255).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Quagga, a routing
daemon.


* [CVE-2012-0249](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0249)
A buffer overflow in the ospf\_ls\_upd\_list\_lsa function in the
 OSPFv2 implementation allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a
 Link State Update (aka LS Update) packet that is smaller than
 the length specified in its header.
* [CVE-2012-0250](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0250)
A buffer overflow in the OSPFv2 implementation allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a
 Link State Update (aka LS Update) packet containing a
 network-LSA link-state advertisement for which the
 data-structure length is smaller than the value in the Length
 header field.
* [CVE-2012-0255](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0255)
The BGP implementation does not properly use message buffers
 for OPEN messages, which allows remote attackers impersonating
 a configured BGP peer to cause a denial of service (assertion
 failure and daemon exit) via a message associated with a
 malformed AS4 capability.


This security update upgrades the quagga package to the most recent
upstream release. This release includes other corrections, such as
hardening against unknown BGP path attributes.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.20.1-0+squeeze2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.99.20.1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.
