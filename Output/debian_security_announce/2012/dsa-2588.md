More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Icedove, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client.


* [CVE-2012-4201](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4201)
The evalInSandbox implementation uses an incorrect context during
 the handling of JavaScript code that sets the location.href
 property, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site
 scripting (XSS) attacks or read arbitrary files by leveraging a
 sandboxed add-on.
* [CVE-2012-4207](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4207)
The HZ-GB-2312 character-set implementation does not properly handle
 a ~ (tilde) character in proximity to a chunk delimiter, which
 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
 attacks via a crafted document.
* [CVE-2012-4216](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4216)
Use-after-free vulnerability in the gfxFont::GetFontEntry function
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
 of service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.
* [CVE-2012-5829](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5829)
Heap-based buffer overflow in the nsWindow::OnExposeEvent function could
 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2012-5842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5842)
Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine could
 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
 corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
 code.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze15.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.11-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
