DSA-2578-1 rssh -- insufficient filtering of rsync command line
---------------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
28 Nov 2012
Affected Packages:

[rssh](https://packages.debian.org/src:rssh)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-2251](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2251), [CVE-2012-2252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2252).  

More information:

James Clawson discovered that rssh, a restricted shell for OpenSSH to be used
with scp, sftp, rdist and cvs, was not correctly filtering command line options.
This could be used to force the execution of a remote script and thus allow
arbitrary command execution. Two CVE were assigned:


* [CVE-2012-2251](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2251)
Incorrect filtering of command line when using rsync protocol. It was
 for example possible to pass dangerous options after a -- switch. The rsync
 protocol support has been added in a Debian (and Fedora/Red Hat) specific
 patch, so this vulnerability doesn't affect upstream.
* [CVE-2012-2252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2252)
Incorrect filtering of the --rsh option: the filter preventing usage of the
 --rsh= option would not prevent passing --rsh. This vulnerability affects
 upstream code.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.2-13squeeze3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-6.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your rssh packages.
