DSA-2573-1 radsecproxy -- SSL certificate verification weakness
---------------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Nov 2012
Affected Packages:

[radsecproxy](https://packages.debian.org/src:radsecproxy)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-4523](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4523), [CVE-2012-4566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4566).  

More information:

Ralf Paffrath reported that Radsecproxy, a RADIUS protocol proxy, mixed up
pre- and post-handshake verification of clients. This vulnerability may
wrongly accept clients without checking their certificate chain under
certain configurations.


Raphael Geissert spotted that the fix for [CVE-2012-4523](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4523) was incomplete,
giving origin to [CVE-2012-4566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4566). Both vulnerabilities are fixed with this
update.


Notice that this fix may make Radsecproxy reject some clients that are
currently (erroneously) being accepted.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4-1+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.2-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your radsecproxy packages.
