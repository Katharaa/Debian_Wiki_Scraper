DSA-2596-1 mediawiki-extensions -- cross-site scripting
-------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 Dec 2012
Affected Packages:

[mediawiki-extensions](https://packages.debian.org/src:mediawiki-extensions)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 696179](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=696179).  

More information:

Thorsten Glaser discovered that the RSSReader extension for MediaWiki, a
website engine for collaborative work, does not properly escape tags in
feeds. This could allow a malicious feed to inject JavaScript into the
MediaWiki pages.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3squeeze2.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.11.


We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki-extensions packages.
