DSA-2504-1 libspring-2.5-java -- information disclosure
-------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
28 Jun 2012
Affected Packages:

[libspring-2.5-java](https://packages.debian.org/src:libspring-2.5-java)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 677814](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=677814).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2011-2730](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2730).  

More information:

It was discovered that the Spring Framework contains an information
disclosure vulnerability in the processing of certain Expression
Language (EL) patterns, allowing attackers to access sensitive
information using HTTP requests.


NOTE: This update adds a springJspExpressionSupport context parameter
which must be manually set to false when the Spring Framework runs
under a container which provides EL support itself.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.6.SEC02-2+squeeze1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libspring-2.5-java packages.
