More information:

Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in PostgreSQL, an
object-relational SQL database. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2012-0866](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0866)
It was discovered that the permissions of a function called by a
 trigger are not checked. This could result in privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2012-0867](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0867)
It was discovered that only the first 32 characters of a host name
 are checked when validating host names through SSL certificates.
 This could result in spoofing the connection in limited
 circumstances.
* [CVE-2012-0868](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0868)
It was discovered that pg\_dump did not sanitise object names.
 This could result in arbitrary SQL command execution if a
 malformed dump file is opened.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.11-0squeeze1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.11-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-8.4 packages.
