========================


DSA-2546-1 freeradius -- stack-based buffer overflows
-----------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
11 Sep 2012
Affected Packages:

[freeradius](https://packages.debian.org/src:freeradius)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 687175](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=687175).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-3547](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3547).  

More information:

Timo Warns discovered that the EAP-TLS handling of FreeRADIUS, a
high-performance and highly configurable RADIUS server, is not properly
performing length checks on user-supplied input before copying to a local
stack buffer. As a result, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this
flaw to crash the daemon or execute arbitrary code via crafted
certificates.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.10+dfsg-2+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.12+dfsg-1.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your freeradius packages.
