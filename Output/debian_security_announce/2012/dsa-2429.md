More information:


 Due to the non-disclosure of security patch information from Oracle,
 we are forced to ship an upstream version update of MySQL 5.1.
 There are several known incompatible
 changes, which are listed in /usr/share/doc/mysql-server/NEWS.Debian.gz.



Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in MySQL, a database
management system. The vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading
MySQL to a new upstream version, 5.1.61, which includes additional
changes, such as performance improvements and corrections for data
loss defects. These changes are described in the MySQL release notes
at: <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-x.html>.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.1.61-0+squeeze1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.1.61-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-5.1 packages.
