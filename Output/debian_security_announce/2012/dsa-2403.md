In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-0830](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0830).  

More information:

Stefan Esser discovered that the implementation of the max\_input\_vars
configuration variable in a recent PHP security update was flawed such
that it allows remote attackers to crash PHP or potentially execute
code.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny16.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze7.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.10-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
