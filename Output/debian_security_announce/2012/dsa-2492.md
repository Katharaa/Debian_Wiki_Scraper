Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2492-1 php5 -- buffer overflow
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Jun 2012
Affected Packages:

[php5](https://packages.debian.org/src:php5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-2386](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2386).  

More information:

The Phar extension for PHP does not properly handle crafted tar files,
leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. PHP applications processing
tar files could crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.


In addition, this update addresses a regression which caused a crash
when accessing a global object that is returned as $this from \_\_get.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze13.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 5.4.4~rc1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
