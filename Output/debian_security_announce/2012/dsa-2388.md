More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in t1lib, a Postscript Type 1
font rasterizer library, some of which might lead to code execution
through the opening of files embedding bad fonts.


* [CVE-2010-2642](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2642)
A heap-based buffer overflow in the AFM font metrics parser
 potentially leads to the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2011-0433](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0433)
Another heap-based buffer overflow in the AFM font metrics
 parser potentially leads to the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2011-0764](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0764)
An invalid pointer dereference allows execution of arbitrary
 code using crafted Type 1 fonts.
* [CVE-2011-1552](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1552)
Another invalid pointer dereference results in an application
 crash, triggered by crafted Type 1 fonts.
* [CVE-2011-1553](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1553)
A use-after-free vulnerability results in an application
 crash, triggered by crafted Type 1 fonts.
* [CVE-2011-1554](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1554)
An off-by-one error results in an invalid memory read and
 application crash, triggered by crafted Type 1 fonts.
