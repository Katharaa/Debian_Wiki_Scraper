More information:

Marek VavruÅ¡a and Lubos Slovak discovered that NSD, an authoritative

This can result in a NULL pointer dereference and crash the handling
process. A remote attacker can abuse this flaw to perform denial of
service attacks.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.5-1.squeeze2.
