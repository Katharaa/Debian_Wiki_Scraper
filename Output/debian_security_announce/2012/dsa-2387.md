timtai1 discovered that simpleSAMLphp, an authentication and federation
platform, is vulnerable to a cross site scripting attack, allowing a
remote attacker to access sensitive client data.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain a simplesamlphp
package.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
