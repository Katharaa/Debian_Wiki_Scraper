--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
13 Apr 2012
Affected Packages:

[puppet](https://packages.debian.org/src:puppet)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-1906](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1906), [CVE-2012-1986](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1986), [CVE-2012-1987](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1987), [CVE-2012-1988](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1988).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Puppet, a centralized
configuration management system. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2012-1906](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1906)
Puppet is using predictable temporary file names when downloading
 Mac OS X package files. This allows a local attacker to either
 overwrite arbitrary files on the system or to install an arbitrary
 package.
* [CVE-2012-1986](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1986)
When handling requests for a file from a remote filebucket, Puppet
 can be tricked into overwriting its defined location for filebucket
 storage. This allows an authorized attacker with access to the Puppet
 master to read arbitrary files.
* [CVE-2012-1987](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1987)
Puppet is incorrectly handling filebucket store requests. This allows
 an attacker to perform denial of service attacks against Puppet by
 resource exhaustion.
* [CVE-2012-1988](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1988)
Puppet is incorrectly handling filebucket requests. This allows an
 attacker with access to the certificate on the agent and an unprivileged
 account on Puppet master to execute arbitrary code via crafted file
 path names and making a filebucket request.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.2-5+squeeze5.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.13-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.13-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.
