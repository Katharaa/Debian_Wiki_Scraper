========================


DSA-2502-1 python-crypto -- programming error
---------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 Jun 2012
Affected Packages:

[python-crypto](https://packages.debian.org/src:python-crypto)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-2417](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2417).  

More information:

It was discovered that that the ElGamal code in PythonCrypto, a
collection of cryptographic algorithms and protocols for Python used
insecure insufficient prime numbers in key generation, which lead to a
weakened signature or public key space, allowing easier brute force
attacks on such keys.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-2+squeeze1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your python-crypto packages. After
installing this update, previously generated keys need to be regenerated.
