More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in TYPO3, a content management
system.


* [CVE-2012-3527](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3527)
An insecure call to unserialize in the help system enables
 arbitrary code execution by authenticated users.
* [CVE-2012-3528](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3528)
The TYPO3 backend contains several cross-site scripting
 vulnerabilities.
* [CVE-2012-3529](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3529)
Authenticated users who can access the configuration module
 can obtain the encryption key, allowing them to escalate their
 privileges.
* [CVE-2012-3530](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3530)
The RemoveXSS HTML sanitizer did not remove several HTML5
 JavaScript, thus failing to mitigate the impact of cross-site
 scripting vulnerabilities.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.3.9+dfsg1-1+squeeze5.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 4.5.19+dfsg1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your typo3-src packages.
