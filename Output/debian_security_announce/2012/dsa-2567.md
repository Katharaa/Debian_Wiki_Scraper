More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Request Tracker (RT), an issue
tracking system.


* [CVE-2012-4730](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4730)
Authenticated users can add arbitrary headers or content to
 mail generated by RT.
* [CVE-2012-4732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4732)
A CSRF vulnerability may allow attackers to toggle ticket
 bookmarks.
* [CVE-2012-4734](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4734)
If users follow a crafted URI and log in to RT, they may
 trigger actions which would ordinarily blocked by the CSRF
 prevention logic.
* [CVE-2012-6578](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6578),
 [CVE-2012-6579](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6579),
 [CVE-2012-6580](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6580),
 [CVE-2012-6581](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6581)
Several different vulnerabilities in GnuPG processing allow
 attackers to cause RT to improperly sign outgoing email.
* [CVE-2012-4884](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4884)
If GnuPG support is enabled, authenticated users can
 create arbitrary files as the web server user, which may
 enable arbitrary code execution.


Please note that if you run request-tracker3.8 under the Apache web
 server, you must stop and start Apache manually. The restart
 mechanism is not recommended, especially when using mod\_perl.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.8.8-7+squeeze6.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.7-2 of the request-tracker4 package.


We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker3.8 packages.
