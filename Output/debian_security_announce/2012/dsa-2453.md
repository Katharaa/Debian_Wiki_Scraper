More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Gajim, a feature-rich
Jabber client. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2012-1987](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1987)
Gajim is not properly sanitizing input before passing it to shell
 commands. An attacker can use this flaw to execute arbitrary code
 on behalf of the victim if the user e.g. clicks on a specially crafted
 URL in an instant message.
* [CVE-2012-2093](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2093)
Gajim is using predictable temporary files in an insecure manner when
 converting instant messages containing LaTeX to images. A local
 attacker can use this flaw to conduct symlink attacks and overwrite
 files the victim has write access to.
* [CVE-2012-2086](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2086)
Gajim is not properly sanitizing input when logging conversations
 which results in the possibility to conduct SQL injection attacks.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.13.4-3+squeeze3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.15-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.15-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your gajim packages.
