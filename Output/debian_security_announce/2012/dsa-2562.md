========================


DSA-2562-1 cups-pk-helper -- privilege escalation
-------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
23 Oct 2012
Affected Packages:

[cups-pk-helper](https://packages.debian.org/src:cups-pk-helper)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-4510](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4510).  

More information:

cups-pk-helper, a PolicyKit helper to configure CUPS with fine-grained
privileges, wraps CUPS function calls in an insecure way. This could
lead to uploading sensitive data to a CUPS resource, or overwriting
specific files with the content of a CUPS resource. The user would have
to explicitly approve the action.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.0-3.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.3-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your cups-pk-helper packages.
