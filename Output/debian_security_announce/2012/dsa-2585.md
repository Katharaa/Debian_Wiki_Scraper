More information:

A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in bogofilter, a software
package for classifying mail messages as spam or non-spam. Crafted
mail messages with invalid base64 data could lead to heap corruption
and, potentially, arbitrary code execution.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2-2+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.2.2+dfsg1-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your bogofilter packages.
