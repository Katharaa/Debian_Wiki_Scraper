Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2575-1 tiff -- heap-based buffer overflow
---------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Nov 2012
Affected Packages:

[tiff](https://packages.debian.org/src:tiff)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-4564](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4564).  

More information:

It was discovered that ppm2tiff of the TIFF tools, a set of utilities
for TIFF manipulation and conversion, is not properly checking the return
value of an internal function used in order to detect integer overflows.
As a consequence, ppm2tiff suffers of a heap-based buffer overflow.
This allows attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code via a crafted
PPM image, especially in scenarios in which images are automatically
processed.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze7.


For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.2-5.


We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.
