More information:

Several issues have been discovered in the MySQL database server. The
vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading MySQL to a new upstream version,
5.1.66, which includes additional changes, such as performance improvements and
corrections for data loss defects. These changes are described in the
[MySQL release notes](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-66.html).



For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), these
problems have been fixed in version 5.5.28+dfsg-1.


Additionally, [CVE-2012-5611](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5611)
has been fixed in this upload. The vulnerability
(discovered independently by Tomas Hoger from the Red Hat Security Response
Team and king cope) is a stack-based buffer overflow in acl\_get() when
checking user access to a database. Using a carefully crafted database name, an
already authenticated MySQL user could make the server crash or even execute
arbitrary code as the mysql system user.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
5.1.66-0+squeeze1.


For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this
problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-5.1 packages.
