Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-8601](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8601).  

More information:

Florian Maury from ANSSI discovered a flaw in pdns-recursor, a
recursive DNS server : a remote attacker controlling
maliciously-constructed zones or a rogue server could affect the
performance of pdns-recursor, thus leading to resource exhaustion and
a potential denial-of-service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3-3+deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 3.6.2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your pdns-recursor packages.
