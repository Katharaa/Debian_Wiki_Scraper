More information:

Michele Spagnuolo, of Google Security Team, and Miroslav Lichvar, of
Red Hat, discovered two issues in flac, a library handling Free
Lossless Audio Codec media: by providing a specially crafted FLAC
file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.1-6+deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie) and unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 1.3.0-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your flac packages.
