DSA-3038-1 libvirt -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
27 Sep 2014
Affected Packages:

[libvirt](https://packages.debian.org/src:libvirt)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 762203](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=762203).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-0179](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0179), [CVE-2014-3633](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3633).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Libvirt, a virtualisation
abstraction library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2014-0179](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0179)
Richard Jones and Daniel P. Berrange found that libvirt passes the
 XML\_PARSE\_NOENT flag when parsing XML documents using the libxml2
 library, in which case all XML entities in the parsed documents are
 expanded. A user able to force libvirtd to parse an XML document
 with an entity pointing to a special file that blocks on read access
 could use this flaw to cause libvirtd to hang indefinitely,
 resulting in a denial of service on the system.
* [CVE-2014-3633](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3633)
Luyao Huang of Red Hat found that the qemu implementation of
 virDomainGetBlockIoTune computed an index into the array of disks
 for the live definition, then used it as the index into the array of
 disks for the persistent definition, which could result into an
 out-of-bounds read access in qemuDomainGetBlockIoTune().


A remote attacker able to establish a read-only connection to
 libvirtd could use this flaw to crash libvirtd or, potentially, leak
 memory from the libvirtd process.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.12.3-1+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.8-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.
