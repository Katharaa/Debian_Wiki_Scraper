----------------------------------



Date Reported:
21 Aug 2014
Affected Packages:

[php5](https://packages.debian.org/src:php5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3538](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3538), [CVE-2014-3587](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3587), [CVE-2014-3597](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3597), [CVE-2014-4670](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4670).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language commonly used for web application development. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2014-3538](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3538)
It was discovered that the original fix for [CVE-2013-7345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7345) did not
 sufficiently address the problem. A remote attacker could still
 cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a specially-crafted
 input file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk
 regular expression rule.
* [CVE-2014-3587](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3587)
It was discovered that the CDF parser of the fileinfo module does
 not properly process malformed files in the Composite Document File
 (CDF) format, leading to crashes.
* [CVE-2014-3597](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3597)
It was discovered that the original fix for [CVE-2014-4049](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4049) did not
 completely address the issue. A malicious server or
 man-in-the-middle attacker could cause a denial of service (crash)
 and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS TXT record.
* [CVE-2014-4670](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4670)
It was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain SPL
 Iterators. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause PHP to
 crash, resulting in a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14+deb7u13. In addition, this update contains several
bugfixes originally targeted for the upcoming Wheezy point release.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
