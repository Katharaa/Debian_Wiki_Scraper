More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors, buffer
overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation errors may lead to
the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security restrictions or
denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.3.0esr-1~deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be
fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.3.0esr-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
