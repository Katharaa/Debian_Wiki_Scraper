Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2908-1 openssl -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
17 Apr 2014
Affected Packages:

[openssl](https://packages.debian.org/src:openssl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 742923](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=742923).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2010-5298](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-5298), [CVE-2014-0076](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0076).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. The following
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ids identify them:


* [CVE-2010-5298](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-5298)
A read buffer can be freed even when it still contains data that is
used later on, leading to a use-after-free. Given a race condition in a
multi-threaded application it may permit an attacker to inject data from
one connection into another or cause denial of service.
* [CVE-2014-0076](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0076)
ECDSA nonces can be recovered through the Yarom/Benger FLUSH+RELOAD
cache side-channel attack.


A third issue, with no CVE id, is the missing detection of the
critical flag for the TSA extended key usage under certain cases.


Additionally, this update checks for more services that might need to
be restarted after upgrades of libssl, corrects the detection of
apache2 and postgresql, and adds support for the
'libraries/restart-without-asking' debconf configuration. This allows
services to be restarted on upgrade without prompting.


The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by [CVE-2010-5298](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-5298)
and it might be updated at a later time to address the remaining
vulnerabilities.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u7.


For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1g-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
