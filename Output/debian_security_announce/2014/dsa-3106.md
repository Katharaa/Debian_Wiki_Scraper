DSA-3106-1 jasper -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
20 Dec 2014
Affected Packages:

[jasper](https://packages.debian.org/src:jasper)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 773463](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=773463).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-8137](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8137), [CVE-2014-8138](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8138).  

More information:

Jose Duart of the Google Security Team discovered a double free flaw
([CVE-2014-8137](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8137)) and a heap-based buffer overflow flaw ([CVE-2014-8138](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8138))
in JasPer, a library for manipulating JPEG-2000 files. A specially
crafted file could cause an application using JasPer to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.900.1-13+deb7u2.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.
