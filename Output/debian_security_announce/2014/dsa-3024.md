encryption subkeys
([CVE-2014-5270](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5270)).


In addition, this update hardens GnuPG's behaviour when treating
keyserver responses; GnuPG now filters keyserver responses to only
accepts those keyid's actually requested by the user.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.
