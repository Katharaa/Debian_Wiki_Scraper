========================


DSA-2972-1 linux -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
06 Jul 2014
Affected Packages:

[linux](https://packages.debian.org/src:linux)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-4699](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4699).  

More information:

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace syscall was not verifying the
RIP register to be valid in the ptrace API on x86\_64 processors. An
unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the kernel (resulting in
denial of service) or for privilege escalation.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.60-1+deb7u1. In addition, this update contains several
bugfixes originally targeted for the upcoming Wheezy point release.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
