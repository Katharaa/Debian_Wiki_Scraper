-----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 706426](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=706426), [Bug 733643](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=733643).

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in memcached, a high-performance
memory object caching system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2011-4971](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4971)
Stefan Bucur reported that memcached could be caused to crash by
 sending a specially crafted packet.
* [CVE-2013-7239](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7239)
It was reported that SASL authentication could be bypassed due to a
 flaw related to the managment of the SASL authentication state. With
 a specially crafted request, a remote attacker may be able to
 authenticate with invalid SASL credentials.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.5-1+deb6u1. Note that the patch for [CVE-2013-7239](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7239) was not
applied for the oldstable distribution as SASL support is not enabled in
this version. This update also provides the fix for [CVE-2013-0179](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0179) which
was fixed for stable already.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.13-0.2+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your memcached packages.
