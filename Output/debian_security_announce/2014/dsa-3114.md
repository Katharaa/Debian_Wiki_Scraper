Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-7209](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7209).  

More information:

Timothy D. Morgan discovered that run-mailcap, an utility to execute
programs via entries in the mailcap file, is prone to shell command
injection via shell meta-characters in filenames. In specific scenarios
this flaw could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.52-1+deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your mime-support packages.
