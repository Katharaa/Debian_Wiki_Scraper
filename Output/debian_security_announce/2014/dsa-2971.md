Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3477), [CVE-2014-3532](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3532), [CVE-2014-3533](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3533).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in dbus, an asynchronous
inter-process communication system. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2014-3477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3477)
Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered that dbus-daemon sends an
 AccessDenied error to the service instead of a client when the
 client is prohibited from accessing the service. A local attacker
 could use this flaw to cause a bus-activated service that is not
 currently running to attempt to start, and fail, denying other users
 access to this service.
* [CVE-2014-3532](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3532)
Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered a bug in dbus-daemon's
 support for file descriptor passing. A malicious process could force
 system services or user applications to be disconnected from the
 D-Bus system by sending them a message containing a file descriptor,
 leading to a denial of service.
* [CVE-2014-3533](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3533)
Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. and Alejandro MartÃ­nez SuÃ¡rez
 discovered that a malicious process could force services to be
 disconnected from the D-Bus system by causing dbus-daemon to attempt
 to forward invalid file descriptors to a victim process, leading to
 a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.6-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.
