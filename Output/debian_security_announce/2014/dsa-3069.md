Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3069-1 curl -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Nov 2014
Affected Packages:

[curl](https://packages.debian.org/src:curl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3707](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3707).  

More information:

Symeon Paraschoudis discovered that the curl\_easy\_duphandle() function
in cURL, an URL transfer library, has a bug that can lead to libcurl
eventually sending off sensitive data that was not intended for sending,
while performing a HTTP POST operation.


This bug requires CURLOPT\_COPYPOSTFIELDS and curl\_easy\_duphandle() to be
used in that order, and then the duplicate handle must be used to
perform the HTTP POST. The curl command line tool is not affected by
this problem as it does not use this sequence.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy11.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be
fixed in version 7.38.0-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.38.0-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
