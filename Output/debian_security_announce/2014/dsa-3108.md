Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3108-1 ntp -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
20 Dec 2014
Affected Packages:

[ntp](https://packages.debian.org/src:ntp)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 773576](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=773576).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-9293](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9293), [CVE-2014-9294](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9294), [CVE-2014-9295](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9295), [CVE-2014-9296](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9296).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the ntp package, an
implementation of the Network Time Protocol.


* [CVE-2014-9293](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9293)
ntpd generated a weak key for its internal use, with full
 administrative privileges. Attackers could use this key to
 reconfigure ntpd (or to exploit other vulnerabilities).
* [CVE-2014-9294](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9294)
The ntp-keygen utility generated weak MD5 keys with insufficient
 entropy.
* [CVE-2014-9295](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9295)
ntpd had several buffer overflows (both on the stack and in the
 data section), allowing remote authenticated attackers to crash
 ntpd or potentially execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2014-9296](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9296)
The general packet processing function in ntpd did not handle an
 error case correctly.


The default ntpd configuration in Debian restricts access to localhost
(and possible the adjacent network in case of IPv6).


Keys explicitly generated by "ntp-keygen -M" should be regenerated.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-2+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.
