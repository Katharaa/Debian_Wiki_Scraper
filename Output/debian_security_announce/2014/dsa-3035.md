========================


DSA-3035-1 bash -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
25 Sep 2014
Affected Packages:

[bash](https://packages.debian.org/src:bash)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 762760](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=762760), [Bug 762761](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=762761).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-7169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7169).  

More information:

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the patch applied to fix [CVE-2014-6271](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-6271)
released in DSA-3032-1 for bash, the GNU Bourne-Again Shell, was
incomplete and could still allow some characters to be injected into
another environment ([CVE-2014-7169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7169)). With this update prefix and suffix
for environment variable names which contain shell functions are added
as hardening measure.


Additionally two out-of-bounds array accesses in the bash parser are
fixed which were revealed in Red Hat's internal analysis for these
issues and also independently reported by Todd Sabin.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2+dfsg-0.1+deb7u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your bash packages.
