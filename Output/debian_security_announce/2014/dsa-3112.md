Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3112-1 sox -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
23 Dec 2014
Affected Packages:

[sox](https://packages.debian.org/src:sox)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 773720](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=773720).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-8145](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8145).  

More information:

Michele Spagnuolo of the Google Security Team dicovered two heap-based
buffer overflows in SoX, the Swiss Army knife of sound processing
programs. A specially crafted wav file could cause an application using
SoX to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 14.4.0-3+deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your sox packages.
