DSA-3037-1 icedove -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
26 Sep 2014
Affected Packages:

[icedove](https://packages.debian.org/src:icedove)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-1568](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1568).  

More information:

Antoine Delignat-Lavaud from Inria discovered an issue in the way NSS (the
Mozilla Network Security Service library, embedded in Wheezy's Icedove),
was parsing ASN.1 data used in signatures, making it vulnerable to a
signature forgery attack.


An attacker could craft ASN.1 data to forge RSA certificates with a valid
certification chain to a trusted CA.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 24.8.1-1~deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie) and unstable distribution (sid),
Icedove uses the system NSS library, handled in DSA 3033-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
