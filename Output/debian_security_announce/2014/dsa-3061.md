More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client: Multiple memory safety
errors, buffer overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation
errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.


This update updates Icedove to the ESR31 series of Thunderbird. In
addition Enigmail was updated to version 1.7.2-1~deb7u1 to ensure
compatibility with the new upstream release.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.2.0-1~deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.2.0-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
