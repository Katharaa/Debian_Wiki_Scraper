Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2943-1 php5 -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
01 Jun 2014
Affected Packages:

[php5](https://packages.debian.org/src:php5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-0185](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0185), [CVE-2014-0237](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0237), [CVE-2014-0238](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0238), [CVE-2014-2270](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2270).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language commonly used for web application development:


* [CVE-2014-0185](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0185)
The default PHP FPM socket permission has been changed from 0666
 to 0660 to mitigate a security vulnerability
 ([CVE-2014-0185](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0185)) in PHP FPM that allowed any local user to run a PHP code
 under the active user of FPM process via crafted FastCGI client.


The default Debian setup now correctly sets the listen.owner and
 listen.group to www-data:www-data in default php-fpm.conf. If you
 have more FPM instances or a webserver not running under www-data
 user you need to adjust the configuration of FPM pools in
 /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/ so the accessing process has rights to
 access the socket.
* [CVE-2014-0237](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0237) /
 [CVE-2014-0238](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0238)
Denial of service in the CDF parser of the fileinfo module.
* [CVE-2014-2270](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2270)
Denial of service in the fileinfo module.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14+deb7u10.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
