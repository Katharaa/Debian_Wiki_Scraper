DSA-2866-1 gnutls26 -- certificate verification flaw
----------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
22 Feb 2014
Affected Packages:

[gnutls26](https://packages.debian.org/src:gnutls26)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-1959](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1959).  

More information:

Suman Jana reported that GnuTLS, deviating from the documented behavior,
considers a version 1 intermediate certificate as a CA certificate by
default.


The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem as
X.509 version 1 trusted CA certificates are not allowed by default.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.20-8.


For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.12.23-12.


We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.
