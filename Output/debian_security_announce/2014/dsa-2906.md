More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service, information leak or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2013-0343](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0343)

 of the IPv6 privacy extensions. Users on the same LAN can cause a denial
 of service or obtain access to sensitive information by sending router
 advertisement messages that cause temporary address generation to be
 disabled.

Dan Carpenter reported issues in the cpqarray driver for Compaq
 Smart2 Controllers and the cciss driver for HP Smart Array controllers
 allowing users to gain access to sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2013-2889](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2889)
Kees Cook discovered missing input sanitization in the HID driver for
 Zeroplus game pads that could lead to a local denial of service.

Andrew Honig of Google reported an issue in the KVM virtualization
 subsystem. A divide-by-zero condition could allow a guest user to
 cause a denial of service on the host (crash).
* [CVE-2013-6380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6380)
Mahesh Rajashekhara reported an issue in the aacraid driver for storage
 products from various vendors. Local users with CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN privileges
 could gain further elevated privileges.
* [CVE-2013-6381](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6381)
Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported an issue in the Gigabit Ethernet
 device support for s390 systems. Local users could cause a denial of
 service or gain elevated privileges via the SIOC\_QETH\_ADP\_SET\_SNMP\_CONTROL
 ioctl.
* [CVE-2013-6382](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6382)
Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported an issue in the XFS filesystem.
 Local users with CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN privileges could gain further elevated
 privileges.
* [CVE-2013-6383](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6383)
Dan Carpenter reported an issue in the aacraid driver for storage devices
 from various vendors. A local user could gain elevated privileges due to
 a missing privilege level check in the aac\_compat\_ioctl function.
* [CVE-2013-7263](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7263)
[CVE-2013-7264](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7264)
[CVE-2013-7265](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7265)
mpb reported an information leak in the recvfrom, recvmmsg and recvmsg
 system calls. A local user could obtain access to sensitive kernel memory.
* [CVE-2013-7339](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7339)

Martin Schwidefsky reported an issue on s390 systems. A local user
 could cause a denial of service (kernel oops) by executing an application
 with a linkage stack instruction.
* [CVE-2014-2523](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2523)
Daniel Borkmann provided a fix for an issue in the nf\_conntrack\_dccp
 module. Remote users could cause a denial of service (system crash)
 or potentially gain elevated privileges.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.32-48squeeze5.


The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:





|  | Debian 6.0 (squeeze) |
| --- | --- |
| user-mode-linux | 2.6.32-1um-4+48squeeze5 |



We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
**Note**: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or leap-frog fashion.
