========================


DSA-2990-1 cups -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
27 Jul 2014
Affected Packages:

[cups](https://packages.debian.org/src:cups)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3537](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3537), [CVE-2014-5029](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5029), [CVE-2014-5030](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5030), [CVE-2014-5031](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5031).  

More information:

It was discovered that the web interface in CUPS, the Common UNIX
Printing System, incorrectly validated permissions on rss files and
directory index files. A local attacker could possibly use this issue
to bypass file permissions and read arbitrary files, possibly leading
to a privilege escalation.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.3-5+deb7u4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.4-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.
