========================


DSA-2903-1 strongswan -- security update
----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
14 Apr 2014
Affected Packages:

[strongswan](https://packages.debian.org/src:strongswan)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-2338](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2338).  

More information:

An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in charon, the daemon
handling IKEv2 in strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec suite. The state machine
handling the security association (IKE\_SA) handled some state transitions
incorrectly.


An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by rekeying an unestablished
IKE\_SA during the initiation itself. This will trick the IKE\_SA state to
established without the need to provide any valid credential.


Vulnerable setups include those actively initiating IKEv2 IKE\_SA (like
âclientsâ or âroadwarriorsâ) but also during re-authentication (which
can be initiated by the responder). Installations using IKEv1 (pluto
daemon in strongSwan 4 and earlier, and IKEv1 code in charon 5.x) is not
affected.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.5.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.
