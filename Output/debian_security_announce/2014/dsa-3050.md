More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors, buffer
overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation errors may lead to
the execution of arbitrary code, denial of service, the bypass of the
same-origin policy or a loss of privacy.


This update updates Iceweasel to the ESR31 series of Firefox. The new
release introduces a new user interface.


In addition, this update also disables SSLv3.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.2.0esr-2~deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.2.0esr-1.


For the experimental distribution, these problems have been fixed in
version 33.0-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
