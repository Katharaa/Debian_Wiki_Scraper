More information:

Alban Crequy and Simon McVittie discovered several vulnerabilities in
the D-Bus message daemon.


* [CVE-2014-3635](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3635)
On 64-bit platforms, file descriptor passing could be abused by
 local users to cause heap corruption in dbus-daemon,
 leading to a crash, or potentially to arbitrary code execution.
* [CVE-2014-3636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3636)
A denial-of-service vulnerability in dbus-daemon allowed local
 attackers to prevent new connections to dbus-daemon, or disconnect
 existing clients, by exhausting descriptor limits.
* [CVE-2014-3637](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3637)
Malicious local users could create D-Bus connections to
 dbus-daemon which could not be terminated by killing the
 participating processes, resulting in a denial-of-service
 vulnerability.
* [CVE-2014-3638](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3638)
dbus-daemon suffered from a denial-of-service vulnerability in the
 code which tracks which messages expect a reply, allowing local
 attackers to reduce the performance of dbus-daemon.
* [CVE-2014-3639](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3639)
dbus-daemon did not properly reject malicious connections from
 local users, resulting in a denial-of-service vulnerability.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.8-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.
