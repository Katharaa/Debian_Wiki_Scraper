-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
28 Apr 2014
Affected Packages:

[super](https://packages.debian.org/src:super)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-0470](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0470).  

More information:

John Lightsey of the Debian Security Audit project discovered that the
super package did not check for setuid failures, allowing local users
to increase the privileges on kernel versions which do not guard
against RLIMIT\_NPROC attacks.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.30.0-3+squeeze2.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.30.0-6+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your super packages.
