Affected Packages:

[bind9](https://packages.debian.org/src:bind9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 735190](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=735190).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-0591](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0591).  

More information:

Jared Mauch reported a denial of service flaw in the way BIND, a DNS
server, handled queries for NSEC3-signed zones. A remote attacker could
use this flaw against an authoritative name server that served
NCES3-signed zones by sending a specially crafted query, which, when
processed, would cause named to crash.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u2.


For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
