[php-cas](https://packages.debian.org/src:php-cas)

Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 759718](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=759718).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-4172](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4172).  

More information:

Marvin S. Addison discovered that Jasig phpCAS, a PHP library for the
CAS authentication protocol, did not encode tickets before adding them
to an URL, creating a possibility for cross site scripting.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1-4+deb7u1.


The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your php-cas packages.
