--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
17 Jul 2014
Affected Packages:

[fail2ban](https://packages.debian.org/src:fail2ban)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-7176](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7176), [CVE-2013-7177](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7177).  

More information:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Fail2ban, a solution to ban hosts
that cause multiple authentication errors. When using Fail2ban to monitor
Postfix or Cyrus IMAP logs, improper input validation in log parsing
could enable a remote attacker to trigger an IP ban on arbitrary
addresses, resulting in denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.6-3wheezy3.


For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.11-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.11-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your fail2ban packages.
