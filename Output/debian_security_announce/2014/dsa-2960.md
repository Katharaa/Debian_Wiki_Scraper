More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client: multiple memory safety
errors and buffer overflows may lead to the execution of arbitrary code
or denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.6.0-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
