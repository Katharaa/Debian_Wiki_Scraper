Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 745157](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=745157), [Bug 725944](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=725944).

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware.


* [CVE-2013-4344](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4344)
Buffer overflow in the SCSI implementation in QEMU,
 when a SCSI controller has more than 256 attached devices, allows
 local users to gain privileges via a small transfer buffer in a
 REPORT LUNS command.
* [CVE-2014-2894](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2894)
Off-by-one error in the cmd\_smart function in the smart self test in
 hw/ide/core.c in QEMU allows local users to have
 unspecified impact via a SMART EXECUTE OFFLINE command that triggers
 a buffer underflow and memory corruption.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
