---------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
19 Jul 2014
Affected Packages:

[ruby-activerecord-3.2](https://packages.debian.org/src:ruby-activerecord-3.2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3482](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3482), [CVE-2014-3483](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3483).  

More information:

Sean Griffin discovered two vulnerabilities in the PostgreSQL adapter
for Active Record which could lead to SQL injection.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.6-5+deb7u1. Debian provides two variants of Ruby on Rails
in Wheezy (2.3 and 3.2). Support for the 2.3 variants had to be ceased
at this point. This affects the following source packages:
ruby-actionmailer-2.3, ruby-actionpack-2.3, ruby-activerecord-2.3,
ruby-activeresource-2.3, ruby-activesupport-2.3 and ruby-rails-2.3. The
version of Redmine in Wheezy still requires 2.3, you can use an updated
version from backports.debian.org which is compatible with rails 3.2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.19-1 of the rails-3.2 source package.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-activerecord-3.2 packages.
