In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-2067](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2067), [CVE-2013-2071](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2071), [CVE-2013-4286](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4286), [CVE-2013-4322](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4322), [CVE-2014-0050](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0050).  

More information:

Multiple security issues were found in the Tomcat servlet and JSP engine:


* [CVE-2013-2067](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2067)
FORM authentication associates the most recent request requiring
 authentication with the current session. By repeatedly sending a request
 for an authenticated resource while the victim is completing the login
 form, an attacker could inject a request that would be executed using the
 victim's credentials.
* [CVE-2013-2071](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2071)
A runtime exception in AsyncListener.onComplete() prevents the request from
 being recycled. This may expose elements of a previous request to a current
 request.
* [CVE-2013-4286](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4286)
Reject requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length
 header when chunked encoding is being used.
* [CVE-2013-4322](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4322)
When processing a request submitted using the chunked transfer encoding,
 Tomcat ignored but did not limit any extensions that were included. This allows
 a client to perform a limited denial of service by streaming an unlimited amount
 of data to the server.
* [CVE-2014-0050](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0050)
Multipart requests with a malformed Content-Type header could trigger an
 infinite loop causing a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.28-4+deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.52-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.52-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat7 packages.
