More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered and fixed in Samba, a SMB/CIFS
file, print, and login server:


* [CVE-2014-0178](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0178)
Information leak vulnerability in the VFS code, allowing an
 authenticated user to retrieve eight bytes of uninitialized memory
 when shadow copy is enabled.
* [CVE-2014-0244](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0244)
Denial of service (infinite CPU loop) in the nmbd Netbios name
 service daemon. A malformed packet can cause the nmbd server to
 enter an infinite loop, preventing it to process later requests to
 the Netbios name service.
* [CVE-2014-3493](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3493)
Denial of service (daemon crash) in the smbd file server daemon. An
 authenticated user attempting to read a Unicode path using a
 non-Unicode request can force the daemon to overwrite memory at an
 invalid address.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u4.


For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.9+dfsg-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.9+dfsg-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
