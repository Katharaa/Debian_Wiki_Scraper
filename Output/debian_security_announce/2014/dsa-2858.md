More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
use-after-frees, too-verbose error messages and missing permission checks
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security
checks or information disclosure. This update also addresses security
issues in the bundled version of the NSS crypto library.


This update updates Iceweasel to the ESR24 series of Firefox.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.3.0esr-1~deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.3.0esr-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
