More information:

Stefano Zacchiroli discovered a vulnerability in exuberant-ctags, a tool
to build tag file indexes of source code definitions: Certain JavaScript
files cause ctags to enter an infinite loop until it runs out of disk
space, resulting in denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:5.9~svn20110310-4+deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:5.9~svn20110310-8.

We recommend that you upgrade your exuberant-ctags packages.
