Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 728705](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=728705).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3534](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3534), [CVE-2014-4667](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4667), [CVE-2014-4943](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4943).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation:


* [CVE-2014-3534](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3534)
Martin Schwidefsky of IBM discovered that the ptrace subsystem does
 not properly sanitize the psw mask value. On s390 systems, an
 unprivileged local user could use this flaw to set address space
 control bits to kernel space combination and thus gain read/write
 access to kernel memory.
* [CVE-2014-4667](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4667)
Gopal Reddy Kodudula of Nokia Siemens Networks discovered that the
 sctp\_association\_free function does not properly manage a certain
 backlog value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (socket outage) via a crafted SCTP packet.
* [CVE-2014-4943](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4943)
Sasha Levin discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's point-to-point
 protocol (PPP) when used with the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
 (L2TP). An unprivileged local user could use this flaw for privilege
 escalation.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.60-1+deb7u3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.14.13-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
