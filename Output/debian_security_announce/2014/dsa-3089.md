More information:

Jose Duart of the Google Security Team discovered heap-based buffer
overflow flaws in JasPer, a library for manipulating JPEG-2000 files,
which could lead to denial of service (application crash) or the
execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.900.1-13+deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.
