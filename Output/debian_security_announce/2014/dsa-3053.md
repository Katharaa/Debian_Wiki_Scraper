========================


DSA-3053-1 openssl -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
16 Oct 2014
Affected Packages:

[openssl](https://packages.debian.org/src:openssl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3513](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3513), [CVE-2014-3566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3566), [CVE-2014-3567](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3567), [CVE-2014-3568](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3568).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL, the Secure Sockets
Layer library and toolkit.


* [CVE-2014-3513](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3513)
A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed the DTLS Secure
 Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) extension data. A remote attacker
 could send multiple specially crafted handshake messages to exhaust
 all available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server.
* [CVE-2014-3566 ("POODLE")](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3566)
A flaw was found in the way SSL 3.0 handled padding bytes when
 decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block
 chaining (CBC) mode. This flaw allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM)
 attacker to decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256
 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send
 the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections. 


This update adds support for Fallback SCSV to mitigate this issue.
* [CVE-2014-3567](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3567)
A memory leak flaw was found in the way an OpenSSL handled failed
 session ticket integrity checks. A remote attacker could exhaust all
 available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server by sending a large number
 of invalid session tickets to that server.
* [CVE-2014-3568](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3568)
When OpenSSL is configured with "no-ssl3" as a build option, servers
 could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be
 configured to send them.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u13.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1j-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
