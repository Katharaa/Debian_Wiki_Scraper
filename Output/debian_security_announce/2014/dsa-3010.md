Vulnerable:

Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-0480](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0480), [CVE-2014-0481](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0481), [CVE-2014-0482](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0482), [CVE-2014-0483](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0483).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python
web development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2014-0480](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0480)
Florian Apolloner discovered that in certain situations, URL
 reversing could generate scheme-relative URLs which could
 unexpectedly redirect a user to a different host, leading to
 phishing attacks.
* [CVE-2014-0481](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0481)
David Wilson reported a file upload denial of service vulnerability.
 Django's file upload handling in its default configuration may
 degrade to producing a huge number of `os.stat()` system calls when
 a duplicate filename is uploaded. A remote attacker with the ability
 to upload files can cause poor performance in the upload handler,
 eventually causing it to become very slow.
* [CVE-2014-0482](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0482)
David Greisen discovered that under some circumstances, the use of
 the RemoteUserMiddleware middleware and the RemoteUserBackend
 authentication backend could result in one user receiving another
 user's session, if a change to the REMOTE\_USER header occurred
 without corresponding logout/login actions.
* [CVE-2014-0483](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0483)
Collin Anderson discovered that it is possible to reveal any field's
 data by modifying the popup and to\_field parameters of the query
 string on an admin change form page. A user with access to the admin
 interface, and with sufficient knowledge of model structure and the
 appropriate URLs, could construct popup views which would display
 the values of non-relationship fields, including fields the
 application developer had not intended to expose in such a fashion.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u8.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.6-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
