DSA-3117-1 php5 -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
31 Dec 2014
Affected Packages:

[php5](https://packages.debian.org/src:php5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-8142](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8142).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language commonly used for web application development.


As announced in DSA 3064-1 it has been decided to follow the stable
5.4.x releases for the Wheezy php5 packages. Consequently the
vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading PHP to a new upstream version
5.4.36, which includes additional bug fixes, new features and possibly
incompatible changes. Please refer to the upstream changelog for more
information:


<http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.4.36>


Two additional patches were applied on top of the imported new upstream
version. An out-of-bounds read flaw was fixed which could lead php5-cgi
to crash. Moreover a bug with php5-pgsql in combination with PostgreSQL
9.1 was fixed
([Debian Bug #773182](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=773182)).


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.36-0+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
