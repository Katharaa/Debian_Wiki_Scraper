Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2833-1 openssl -- several vulnerabilities
---------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
01 Jan 2014
Affected Packages:

[openssl](https://packages.debian.org/src:openssl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 732754](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=732754), [Bug 732710](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=732710).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-6449](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6449), [CVE-2013-6450](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6450).  

More information:

Multiple security issues have been fixed in OpenSSL: The TLS 1.2 support
was susceptible to denial of service and retransmission of DTLS messages
was fixed. In addition this update disables the insecure Dual\_EC\_DRBG
algorithm (which was unused anyway, see
<http://marc.info/?l=openssl-announce&m=138747119822324&w=2> for further
information) and no longer uses the RdRand feature available on some
Intel CPUs as a sole source of entropy unless explicitly requested.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-5.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
