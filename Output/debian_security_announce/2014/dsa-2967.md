-----------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[gnupg](https://packages.debian.org/src:gnupg)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 752497](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=752497).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-4617](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4617).  

More information:

Jean-RenÃ© Reinhard, Olivier Levillain and Florian Maury reported that
GnuPG, the GNU Privacy Guard, did not properly parse certain garbled
compressed data packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to mount
a denial of service against GnuPG by triggering an infinite loop.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.12-7+deb7u4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.16-1.2.


We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.
