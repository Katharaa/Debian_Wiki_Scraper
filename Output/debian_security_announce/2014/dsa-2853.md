DSA-2853-1 horde3 -- remote code execution
------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
05 Feb 2014
Affected Packages:

[horde3](https://packages.debian.org/src:horde3)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 737149](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=737149).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-1691](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1691).  

More information:

Pedro Ribeiro from Agile Information Security found a possible remote
code execution on Horde3, a web application framework. Unsanitized
variables are passed to the unserialize() PHP function. A remote attacker
could specially-craft one of those variables allowing her to load and
execute code.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.8+debian0-3.


In the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions, Horde is
distributed in the php-horde-util package. This problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.0-1. 


We recommend that you upgrade your horde3 packages.
