DSA-2910-1 qemu-kvm -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Apr 2014
Affected Packages:

[qemu-kvm](https://packages.debian.org/src:qemu-kvm)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-0150](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0150).  

More information:

Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat discovered a buffer overflow flaw in the
way qemu processed MAC addresses table update requests from the guest.


A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt qemu process
memory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code
execution on the host with the privileges of the qemu process.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5+dfsg-5+squeeze11.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
