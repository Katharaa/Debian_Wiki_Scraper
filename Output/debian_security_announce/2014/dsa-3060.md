More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service:


* [CVE-2014-3610](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3610)
Lars Bull of Google and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM
 handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged
 guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
 (kernel panic) on the host.
* [CVE-2014-3611](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3611)
Lars Bull of Google reported a race condition in the PIT
 emulation code in KVM. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o
 ports could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash)
 on the host.
* [CVE-2014-3645](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3645)
/ [CVE-2014-3646](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3646)
The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security discovered
 that the KVM subsystem did not handle the VM exits gracefully
 for the invept (Invalidate Translations Derived from EPT) and
 invvpid (Invalidate Translations Based on VPID) instructions. On
 hosts with an Intel processor and invept/invppid VM exit
 support, an unprivileged guest user could use these instructions
 to crash the guest.
* [CVE-2014-3647](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3647)
Nadav Amit reported that KVM mishandles noncanonical addresses when
 emulating instructions that change rip, potentially causing a failed
 VM-entry. A guest user with access to I/O or the MMIO can use this
 flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) of the guest.
* [CVE-2014-3673](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3673)
Liu Wei of Red Hat discovered a flaw in net/core/skbuff.c leading to
 a kernel panic when receiving malformed ASCONF chunks. A remote
 attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.
* [CVE-2014-3687](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3687)
A flaw in the sctp stack was discovered leading to a kernel panic
 when receiving duplicate ASCONF chunks. A remote attacker could use
 this flaw to crash the system.
* [CVE-2014-3688](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3688)
It was found that the sctp stack is prone to a remotely triggerable
 memory pressure issue caused by excessive queueing. A remote
 attacker could use this flaw to cause denial-of-service conditions
 on the system.
* [CVE-2014-3690](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3690)
Andy Lutomirski discovered that incorrect register handling in KVM
 may lead to denial of service.
* [CVE-2014-7207](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7207)
Several Debian developers reported an issue in the IPv6 networking
 subsystem. A local user with access to tun or macvtap devices, or a
 virtual machine connected to such a device, can cause a denial of
 service (system crash).


This update includes a bug fix related to [CVE-2014-7207](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7207) that disables
UFO (UDP Fragmentation Offload) in the macvtap, tun, and virtio\_net
drivers. This will cause migration of a running VM from a host running
an earlier kernel version to a host running this kernel version to fail,
if the VM has been assigned a virtio network device. In order to migrate
such a VM, it must be shut down first.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.63-2+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
