Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 763780](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=763780).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-7206](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7206).  

More information:

Guillem Jover discovered that the changelog retrieval functionality in
apt-get used temporary files in an insecure way, allowing a local user
to cause arbitrary files to be overwritten.


This vulnerability is neutralized by the fs.protected\_symlinks setting in
the Linux kernel, which is enabled by default in Debian 7 Wheezy and up.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.7.9+deb7u6.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.9.2.


We recommend that you upgrade your apt packages.
