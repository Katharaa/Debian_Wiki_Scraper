DSA-3074-1 php5 -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Nov 2014
Affected Packages:

[php5](https://packages.debian.org/src:php5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 768807](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=768807).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3710](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3710).  

More information:

Francisco Alonso of Red Hat Product Security found an issue in the file
utility, whose code is embedded in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language. When checking ELF files, note headers are incorrectly
checked, thus potentially allowing attackers to cause a denial of
service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) by supplying a
specially crafted ELF file.


As announced in DSA-3064-1 it has been decided to follow the stable
5.4.x releases for the Wheezy php5 packages. Consequently the
vulnerability is addressed by upgrading PHP to a new upstream version
5.4.35, which includes additional bug fixes, new features and possibly
incompatible changes. Please refer to the upstream changelog for more
information:


<http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.4.35>
For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.35-0+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
