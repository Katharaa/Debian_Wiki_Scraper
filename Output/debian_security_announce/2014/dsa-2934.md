In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-0472](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0472), [CVE-2014-0473](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0473), [CVE-2014-0474](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0474), [CVE-2014-1418](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1418), [CVE-2014-3730](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3730).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python
web development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2014-0472](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0472)
Benjamin Bach discovered that Django incorrectly handled dotted
 Python paths when using the reverse() URL resolver function. An
 attacker able to request a specially crafted view from a Django
 application could use this issue to cause Django to import arbitrary
 modules from the Python path, resulting in possible code execution.
* [CVE-2014-0473](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0473)
Paul McMillan discovered that Django incorrectly cached certain
 pages that contained CSRF cookies. A remote attacker could use this
 flaw to acquire the CSRF token of a different user and bypass
 intended CSRF protections in a Django application.
* [CVE-2014-0474](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0474)
Michael Koziarski discovered that certain Django model field classes
 did not properly perform type conversion on their arguments, which
 allows remote attackers to obtain unexpected results.
* [CVE-2014-1418](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1418)
Michael Nelson, Natalia Bidart and James Westby discovered that
 cached data in Django could be served to a different session, or to
 a user with no session at all. An attacker may use this to retrieve
 private data or poison caches.
* [CVE-2014-3730](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3730)
Peter Kuma and Gavin Wahl discovered that Django incorrectly
 validated certain malformed URLs from user input. An attacker may
 use this to cause unexpected redirects.
