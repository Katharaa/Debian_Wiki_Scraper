More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the lighttpd web server.


* [CVE-2014-2323](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2323)
Jann Horn discovered that specially crafted host names can be used
 to inject arbitrary MySQL queries in lighttpd servers using the
 MySQL virtual hosting module (mod\_mysql\_vhost).


This only affects installations with the lighttpd-mod-mysql-vhost
 binary package installed and in use.
* [CVE-2014-2324](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2324)
Jann Horn discovered that specially crafted host names can be used
 to traverse outside of the document root under certain situations
 in lighttpd servers using either the mod\_mysql\_vhost, mod\_evhost,
 or mod\_simple\_vhost virtual hosting modules.


Servers not using these modules are not affected.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.28-2+squeeze1.6.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.31-4+deb7u3.


For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.33-1+nmu3.


We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.
