DSA-3013-1 s3ql -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
27 Aug 2014
Affected Packages:

[s3ql](https://packages.debian.org/src:s3ql)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-0485](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0485).  

More information:

Nikolaus Rath discovered that s3ql, a file system for online data
storage, used the pickle functionality of the Python programming
language in an unsafe way. As a result, a malicious storage backend
or man-in-the-middle attacker was able execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.11.1-3+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your s3ql packages.
