DSA-2961-1 php5 -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
16 Jun 2014
Affected Packages:

[php5](https://packages.debian.org/src:php5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 751364](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=751364).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-4049](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4049).  

More information:

It was discovered that PHP, a general-purpose scripting language
commonly used for web application development, is vulnerable to a
heap-based buffer overflow in the DNS TXT record parsing. A malicious
server or man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly use this flaw to
execute arbitrary code as the PHP interpreter if a PHP application uses
dns\_get\_record() to perform a DNS query.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14+deb7u11.


For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.0~beta4+dfsg-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.0~beta4+dfsg-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
