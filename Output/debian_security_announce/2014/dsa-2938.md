========================


DSA-2938-1 -- Availability of LTS support for Debian 6.0 / squeeze
------------------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
27 May 2014
Affected Packages:



Vulnerable:
No
Security database references:
No other external database security references currently available.
More information:

The initial organisation and setup of Squeeze LTS has now happened and it is
ready for taking over security support once the standard security support ends
at the end of the month:


### Information for users


Support for Squeeze LTS will end five years after the release of Squeeze,
i.e. until the 6th of February 2016.


You need to enable the apt sources for squeeze-lts manually.
Information on how to do this can be found at
<https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development#Add_squeeze-lts_to_your_sources.list>


You should also subscribe to the new annoucement mailing list for security
updates for squeeze-lts:
<https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/>


A few packages are not covered by the Squeeze LTS support. These can be
detected with the new tool `debian-security-support`. Information on
how to run it can be found here:
<https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development#Check_for_unsupported_packages>


If `debian-security-support` detects an unsupported package which
is critical to you, please get in touch with
[debian-lts@lists.debian.org](mailto:debian-lts@lists.debian.org)
(see below).


squeeze-backports will continue to be supported for the lifetime of
Squeeze LTS.


### Information for Debian maintainers


First of all, Debian package maintainers are not expected to work on updates
of their packages for squeeze-lts. Package updates for squeeze-lts
will be handled by the Debian LTS team.


However, if you *are* interested in doing so (and the maintainer always
knows best on a package), you're certainly welcome to do so; everyone in the
Debian.org and Debian maintainers key ring can upload to the squeeze-lts
suite. Information on how to upload a fixed package can be found at
<https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development#Upload_Packages>


### Mailing lists


The whole coordination of the Debian LTS effort is handled through the
debian-lts mailing list: <https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/>


Please subscribe or follow us via GMANE (gmane.linux.debian.devel.lts)


Aside from the debian-lts-announce list, there's also a list for
following all uploads in debian-lts:
<https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-changes/>


### Security Tracker


All information on the status of vulnerabilities (e.g. if the version in
squeeze-lts happens to be unaffected while wheezy is affected) will be
tracked in the Debian Security Tracker:


<https://security-tracker.debian.org>


If you happen to spot an error in the data, please see
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report>
