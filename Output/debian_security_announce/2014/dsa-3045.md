More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor
emulator:


* Various security issues have been found in the block qemu drivers.
 Malformed disk images might result in the execution of arbitrary code.
* A NULL pointer dereference in SLIRP may result in denial of service
* An information leak was discovered in the VGA emulation


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.
