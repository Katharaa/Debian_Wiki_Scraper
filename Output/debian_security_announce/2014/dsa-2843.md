DSA-2843-1 graphviz -- buffer overflow
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
13 Jan 2014
Affected Packages:

[graphviz](https://packages.debian.org/src:graphviz)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 734745](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=734745).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-0978](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0978), [CVE-2014-1236](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1236).  

More information:

Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities were reported in Graphviz, a rich
collection of graph drawing tools. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2014-0978](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0978)
It was discovered that user-supplied input used in the yyerror()
 function in lib/cgraph/scan.l is not bound-checked before beeing
 copied into an insufficiently sized memory buffer. A
 context-dependent attacker could supply a specially crafted input
 file containing a long line to cause a stack-based buffer overlow,
 resulting in a denial of service (application crash) or potentially
 allowing the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2014-1236](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1236)
Sebastian Krahmer reported an overflow condition in the chkNum()
 function in lib/cgraph/scan.l that is triggered as the used regular
 expression accepts an arbitrary long digit list. With a specially
 crafted input file, a context-dependent attacker can cause a
 stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
 (application crash) or potentially allowing the execution of
 arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.26.3-5+squeeze2.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.26.3-14+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your graphviz packages.
