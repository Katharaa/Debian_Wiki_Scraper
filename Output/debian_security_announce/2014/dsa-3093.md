-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
08 Dec 2014
Affected Packages:

[linux](https://packages.debian.org/src:linux)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-7841](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7841), [CVE-2014-8369](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8369), [CVE-2014-8884](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8884), [CVE-2014-9090](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9090).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation:


* [CVE-2014-7841](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7841)
Liu Wei of Red Hat discovered that a SCTP server doing ASCONF will
 panic on malformed INIT chunks by triggering a NULL pointer
 dereference.
* [CVE-2014-8369](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8369)
A flaw was discovered in the way iommu mapping failures were handled
 in the kvm\_iommu\_map\_pages() function in the Linux kernel. A guest
 OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host
 OS memory corruption) or possibly have other unspecified impact on
 the host OS.
* [CVE-2014-8884](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8884)
A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the
 TechnoTrend/Hauppauge DEC USB driver. A local user with write access
 to the corresponding device could use this flaw to crash the kernel
 or, potentially, elevate their privileges.
* [CVE-2014-9090](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9090)
Andy Lutomirski discovered that the do\_double\_fault function in
 arch/x86/kernel/traps.c in the Linux kernel did not properly handle
 faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) segment register,
 which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic).


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.63-2+deb7u2. This update also includes fixes for regressions
introduced by previous updates.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon
in version 3.16.7-ckt2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
