DSA-2850-1 libyaml -- heap-based buffer overflow
------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
31 Jan 2014
Affected Packages:

[libyaml](https://packages.debian.org/src:libyaml)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 737076](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=737076).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-6393](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6393).  

More information:

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered a
heap-based buffer overflow flaw in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and
emitter library. A remote attacker could provide a YAML document with a
specially-crafted tag that, when parsed by an application using libyaml,
would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.3-1+deb6u2.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.4-2+deb7u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.4-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your libyaml packages.
