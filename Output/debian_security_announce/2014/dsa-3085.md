* [CVE-2014-9031](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9031)
Jouko Pynnonen discovered an unauthenticated cross site scripting
 vulnerability (XSS) in wptexturize(), exploitable via comments or
 posts.
* [CVE-2014-9033](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9033)
Cross site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the password
 changing process, which could be used by an attacker to trick an
 user into changing her password.
* [CVE-2014-9034](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9034)
Javier Nieto Arevalo and Andres Rojas Guerrero reported a potential
 denial of service in the way the phpass library is used to handle
 passwords, since no maximum password length was set.
* [CVE-2014-9035](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9035)
John Blackbourn reported an XSS in the Press This function (used
 for quick publishing using a browser bookmarklet).
* [CVE-2014-9036](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9036)
Robert Chapin reported an XSS in the HTML filtering of CSS in posts.
* [CVE-2014-9037](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9037)
David Anderson reported a hash comparison vulnerability for
 passwords stored using the old-style MD5 scheme. While unlikely,
 this could be exploited to compromise an account, if the user had
 not logged in after a Wordpress 2.5 update (uploaded to Debian on 2
 Apr, 2008) and the password MD5 hash could be collided with due to
 PHP dynamic comparison.
* [CVE-2014-9038](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9038)
Ben Bidner reported a server side request forgery (SSRF) in the core
 HTTP layer which unsufficiently blocked the loopback IP address
 space.
* [CVE-2014-9039](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9039)
Momen Bassel, Tanoy Bose, and Bojan Slavkovic reported a
 vulnerability in the password reset process: an email address change
 would not invalidate a previous password reset email.
