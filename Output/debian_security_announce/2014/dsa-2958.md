========================


DSA-2958-1 apt -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
12 Jun 2014
Affected Packages:

[apt](https://packages.debian.org/src:apt)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 749795](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=749795).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-0478](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0478).  

More information:

Jakub Wilk discovered that APT, the high level package manager,
did not properly perform authentication checks for source packages
downloaded via "apt-get source". This only affects use cases where
source packages are downloaded via this command; it does not
affect regular Debian package installation and upgrading.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.7.9+deb7u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4.


We recommend that you upgrade your apt packages.
