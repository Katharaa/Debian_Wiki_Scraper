Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2879-1 libssh -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
13 Mar 2014
Affected Packages:

[libssh](https://packages.debian.org/src:libssh)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-0017](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0017).  

More information:

It was discovered that libssh, a tiny C SSH library, did not reset the
state of the PRNG after accepting a connection. A server mode
application that forks itself to handle incoming connections could see
its children sharing the same PRNG state, resulting in a cryptographic
weakness and possibly the recovery of the private key.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.5-3+squeeze2.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.4-1+deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.4-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.4-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your libssh packages.
