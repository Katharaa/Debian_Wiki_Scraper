Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-1475](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1475).  

More information:

Christian Mainka and Vladislav Mladenov reported a vulnerability in the
OpenID module of Drupal, a fully-featured content management framework.
A malicious user could exploit this flaw to log in as other users on the
site, including administrators, and hijack their accounts.


These fixes require extra updates to the database which can be done from
the administration pages.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.30-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your drupal6 packages.
