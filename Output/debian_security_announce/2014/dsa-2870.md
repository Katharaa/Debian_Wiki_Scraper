DSA-2870-1 libyaml-libyaml-perl -- heap-based buffer overflow
-------------------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
08 Mar 2014
Affected Packages:

[libyaml-libyaml-perl](https://packages.debian.org/src:libyaml-libyaml-perl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-6393](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6393).  

More information:

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered a
heap-based buffer overflow flaw in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and
emitter library. A remote attacker could provide a YAML document with a
specially-crafted tag that, when parsed by an application using libyaml,
would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application.


This update corrects this flaw in the copy that is embedded in the
libyaml-libyaml-perl package.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.33-1+squeeze2.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.38-3+deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.41-4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.41-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your libyaml-libyaml-perl packages.
