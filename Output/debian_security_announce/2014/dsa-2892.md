----------------------------------



Date Reported:
31 Mar 2014
Affected Packages:

[a2ps](https://packages.debian.org/src:a2ps)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 737385](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=737385), [Bug 742902](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=742902).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2001-1593](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2001-1593), [CVE-2014-0466](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0466).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been found in a2ps, an Anything to
PostScript converter and pretty-printer. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2001-1593](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2001-1593)
The spy\_user function which is called when a2ps is invoked with the
 --debug flag insecurely used temporary files.
* [CVE-2014-0466](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0466)
Brian M. Carlson reported that a2ps's fixps script does not invoke
 gs with the -dSAFER option. Consequently executing fixps on a
 malicious PostScript file could result in files being deleted or
 arbitrary commands being executed with the privileges of the user
 running fixps.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.14-1.1+deb6u1.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.14-1.1+deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your a2ps packages.
