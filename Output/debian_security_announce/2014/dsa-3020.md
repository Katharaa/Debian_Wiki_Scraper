DSA-3020-1 acpi-support -- security update
------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Sep 2014
Affected Packages:

[acpi-support](https://packages.debian.org/src:acpi-support)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-0484](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0484).  

More information:

During a review for EDF, Raphael Geissert discovered that the
acpi-support package did not properly handle data obtained from a
user's environment. This could lead to program malfunction or allow a
local user to escalate privileges to the root user due to a programming
error.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.140-5+deb7u3.


For the testing distribution (jessie), and the unstable distribution (sid)
this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your acpi-support packages.
