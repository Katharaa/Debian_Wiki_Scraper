DSA-3094-1 bind9 -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
08 Dec 2014
Affected Packages:

[bind9](https://packages.debian.org/src:bind9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-8500](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8500).  

More information:

It was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, is prone to a denial of
service vulnerability.


By making use of maliciously-constructed zones or a rogue server, an
attacker can exploit an oversight in the code BIND 9 uses to follow
delegations in the Domain Name Service, causing BIND to issue unlimited
queries in an attempt to follow the delegation.


This can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service
(up to and including termination of the named server process.)


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u3.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be
fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
