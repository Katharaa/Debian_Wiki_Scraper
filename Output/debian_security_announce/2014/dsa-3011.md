More information:

It was discovered that MediaWiki, a website engine for collaborative
work, is vulnerable to JSONP injection in Flash ([CVE-2014-5241](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5241)) and
clickjacking between OutputPage and ParserOutput ([CVE-2014-5243](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5243)). The
vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading MediaWiki to the new upstream
version 1.19.18, which includes additional changes.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.19.18+dfsg-0+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.
