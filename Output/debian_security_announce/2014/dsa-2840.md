DSA-2840-1 srtp -- buffer overflow
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Jan 2014
Affected Packages:

[srtp](https://packages.debian.org/src:srtp)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 711163](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=711163).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-2139](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2139).  

More information:

Fernando Russ from Groundworks Technologies reported a buffer overflow
 flaw in srtp, Cisco's reference implementation of the Secure Real-time
 Transport Protocol (SRTP), in how the
 crypto\_policy\_set\_from\_profile\_for\_rtp() function applies
 cryptographic profiles to an srtp\_policy. A remote attacker could
 exploit this vulnerability to crash an application linked against
 libsrtp, resulting in a denial of service.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4~dfsg-6+deb6u1.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4+20100615~dfsg-2+deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5~20130609~dfsg-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5~20130609~dfsg-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your srtp packages.
