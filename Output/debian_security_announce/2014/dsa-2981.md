More information:

A flaw was discovered in PolarSSL, a lightweight crypto and SSL/TLS
library, which can be exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker to
mount a denial of service against PolarSSL servers that offer GCM
ciphersuites. Potentially clients are affected too if a malicious server
decides to execute the denial of service attack against its clients.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.9-1~deb7u3.


For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.7-2.1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.7-2.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.
