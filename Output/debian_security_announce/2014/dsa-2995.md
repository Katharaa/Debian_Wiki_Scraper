========================


DSA-2995-1 lzo2 -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
03 Aug 2014
Affected Packages:

[lzo2](https://packages.debian.org/src:lzo2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 752861](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=752861).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-4607](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4607).  

More information:

Don A. Bailey from Lab Mouse Security discovered an integer overflow
flaw in the way the lzo library decompressed certain archives compressed
with the LZO algorithm. An attacker could create a specially crafted
LZO-compressed input that, when decompressed by an application using the
lzo library, would cause that application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.06-1+deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.08-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.08-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your lzo2 packages.
