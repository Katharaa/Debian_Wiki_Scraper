DSA-3056-1 libtasn1-3 -- security update
----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
26 Oct 2014
Affected Packages:

[libtasn1-3](https://packages.debian.org/src:libtasn1-3)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3467](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3467), [CVE-2014-3468](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3468), [CVE-2014-3469](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3469).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libtasn1-3, a library that
manages ASN1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) structures. An attacker
could use those to cause a denial-of-service via out-of-bounds access
or NULL pointer dereference.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.13-2+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-3 packages.
