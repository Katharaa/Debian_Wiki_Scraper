More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client: Multiple memory safety
errors, buffer overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation errors
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security
restrictions or denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.3.0-1~deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be
fixed soon.
