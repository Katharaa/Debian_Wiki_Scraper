Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-2894-1 openssh -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
05 Apr 2014
Affected Packages:

[openssh](https://packages.debian.org/src:openssh)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 742513](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=742513).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-2532](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2532), [CVE-2014-2653](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2653).  

More information:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSH, an implementation of the
SSH protocol suite. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2014-2532](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2532)
Jann Horn discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled wildcards in
 AcceptEnv lines. A remote attacker could use this issue to trick
 OpenSSH into accepting any environment variable that contains the
 characters before the wildcard character.
* [CVE-2014-2653](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2653)
Matthew Vernon reported that if a SSH server offers a
 HostCertificate that the ssh client doesn't accept, then the client
 doesn't check the DNS for SSHFP records. As a consequence a
 malicious server can disable SSHFP-checking by presenting a
 certificate.


Note that a host verification prompt is still displayed before
 connecting.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:5.5p1-6+squeeze5.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:6.0p1-4+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:6.6p1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.
