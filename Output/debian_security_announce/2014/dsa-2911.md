More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client. Multiple memory safety
errors, out of bound reads, use-after-frees and other implementation
errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, information
disclosure or denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.4.0-1~deb7u1. This updates Icedove to the Extended Support
Release (ESR) branch 24. An updated and compatible version of Enigmail
is included with this update.


For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.4.0-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.4.0-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
