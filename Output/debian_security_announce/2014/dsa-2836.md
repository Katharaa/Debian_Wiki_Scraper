More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in uscan, a tool to scan
upstream sites for new releases of packages, which is part of the
devscripts package. An attacker controlling a website from which uscan
would attempt to download a source tarball could execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running uscan.


The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project id [CVE-2013-6888](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6888) has
been assigned to identify them.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.12.6+deb7u2.


For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.13.9.


We recommend that you upgrade your devscripts packages.
