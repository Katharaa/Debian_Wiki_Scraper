More information:

Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language commonly used for web application development. It has been
decided to follow the stable 5.4.x releases for the Wheezy PHP packages.
Consequently the vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading PHP to a new
upstream version 5.4.34, which includes additional bug fixes, new
features and possibly incompatible changes. Please refer to the upstream
changelog for more information:


<http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.4.34>


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.34-0+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
