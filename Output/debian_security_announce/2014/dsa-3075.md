DSA-3075-1 drupal7 -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
20 Nov 2014
Affected Packages:

[drupal7](https://packages.debian.org/src:drupal7)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-9015](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9015), [CVE-2014-9016](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9016).  

More information:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Drupal, a fully-featured content
management framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2014-9015](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9015)
Aaron Averill discovered that a specially crafted request can give a
 user access to another user's session, allowing an attacker to
 hijack a random session.
* [CVE-2014-9016](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9016)
Michael Cullum, Javier Nieto and Andres Rojas Guerrero discovered
 that the password hashing API allows an attacker to send
 specially crafted requests resulting in CPU and memory
 exhaustion. This may lead to the site becoming unavailable or
 unresponsive (denial of service).


Custom configured session.inc and password.inc need to be audited as
well to verify if they are prone to these vulnerabilities. More
information can be found in the upstream advisory at
<https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-006>


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.14-2+deb7u8.


We recommend that you upgrade your drupal7 packages.
