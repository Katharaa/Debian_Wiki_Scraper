More information:

Bastian Blank reported a denial of service vulnerability in
Email::Address, a Perl module for RFC 2822 address parsing and creation.
Email::Address::parse used significant time on parsing empty quoted
strings. A remote attacker able to supply specifically crafted input to
an application using Email::Address for parsing, could use this flaw to
mount a denial of service attack against the application.
