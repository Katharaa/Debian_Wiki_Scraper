-----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
11 Feb 2014
Affected Packages:

[parcimonie](https://packages.debian.org/src:parcimonie)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 738134](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=738134).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-1921](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1921).  

More information:

Holger Levsen discovered that parcimonie, a privacy-friendly helper to
refresh a GnuPG keyring, is affected by a design problem that undermines
the usefulness of this piece of software in the intended threat model.


When using parcimonie with a large keyring (1000 public keys or more),
it would always sleep exactly ten minutes between two key fetches. This
can probably be used by an adversary who can watch enough key fetches to
correlate multiple key fetches with each other, which is what parcimonie
aims at protecting against. Smaller keyrings are affected to a smaller
degree. This problem is slightly mitigated when using a HKP(s) pool as
the configured GnuPG keyserver.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.1-1+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your parcimonie packages.
