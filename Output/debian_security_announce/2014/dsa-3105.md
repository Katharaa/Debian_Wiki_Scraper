DSA-3105-1 heirloom-mailx -- security update
--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
16 Dec 2014
Affected Packages:

[heirloom-mailx](https://packages.debian.org/src:heirloom-mailx)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2004-2771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-2771), [CVE-2014-7844](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7844).  

More information:

Two security vulnerabilities were discovered in Heirloom mailx, an
implementation of the mail command:


* [CVE-2004-2771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-2771)
mailx interprets shell meta-characters in certain email
 addresses.
* [CVE-2014-7844](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7844)
An unexpected feature of mailx treats syntactically valid email
 addresses as shell commands to execute.


Shell command execution can be re-enabled using the expandaddr
option.


Note that this security update does not remove all mailx facilities
for command execution, though. Scripts which send mail to addresses
obtained from an untrusted source (such as a web form) should use the
`--` separator before the email addresses (which was fixed to work
properly in this update), or they should be changed to invoke
`mail -t` or `sendmail -i -t` instead, passing the recipient addresses
as part of the mail header.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 12.5-2+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your heirloom-mailx packages.
