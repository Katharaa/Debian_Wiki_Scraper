DSA-2989-1 apache2 -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 Jul 2014
Affected Packages:

[apache2](https://packages.debian.org/src:apache2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-0118](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0118), [CVE-2014-0226](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0226), [CVE-2014-0231](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0231).  

More information:

Several security issues were found in the Apache HTTP server.


* [CVE-2014-0118](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0118)
The DEFLATE input filter (inflates request bodies) in mod\_deflate
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
 consumption) via crafted request data that decompresses to a much
 larger size.
* [CVE-2014-0226](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0226)
A race condition was found in mod\_status. An attacker able to
 access a public server status page on a server could send carefully
 crafted requests which could lead to a heap buffer overflow,
 causing denial of service, disclosure of sensitive information, or
 potentially the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2014-0231](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0231)
A flaw was found in mod\_cgid. If a server using mod\_cgid hosted
 CGI scripts which did not consume standard input, a remote attacker
 could cause child processes to hang indefinitely, leading to denial
 of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-13+deb7u3.


For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.4.10-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.10-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
