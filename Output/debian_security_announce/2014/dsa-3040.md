More information:

Rainer Gerhards, the rsyslog project leader, reported a vulnerability in
Rsyslog, a system for log processing. As a consequence of this
vulnerability an attacker can send malformed messages to a server, if
this one accepts data from untrusted sources, and trigger a denial of
service attack.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.8.11-3+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your rsyslog packages.
