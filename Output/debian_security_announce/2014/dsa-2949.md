-----------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[linux](https://packages.debian.org/src:linux)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3144](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3144), [CVE-2014-3145](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3145), [CVE-2014-3153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3153).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation:


* [CVE-2014-3144](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3144)
/ [CVE-2014-3145](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3145)
A local user can cause a denial of service (system crash) via
 crafted BPF instructions.
* [CVE-2014-3153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3153)
Pinkie Pie discovered an issue in the futex subsystem that allows a
 local user to gain ring 0 control via the futex syscall. An
 unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the kernel (resulting
 in denial of service) or for privilege escalation.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.57-3+deb7u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
