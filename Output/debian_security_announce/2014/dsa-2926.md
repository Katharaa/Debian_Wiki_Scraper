* [CVE-2014-0196](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0196)
Jiri Slaby discovered a race condition in the pty layer, which could
 lead to denial of service or privilege escalation.

 [CVE-2014-1738](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1738)
Matthew Daley discovered that missing input sanitising in the
 FDRAWCMD ioctl and an information leak could result in privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2014-2851](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2851)
Incorrect reference counting in the ping\_init\_sock() function allows
 denial of service or privilege escalation.

Incorrect locking of memory can result in local denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.57-3+deb7u1. This update also fixes a regression in the isci
driver and suspend problems with certain AMD CPUs (introduced in the
updated kernel from the Wheezy 7.5 point release).


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
