More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in getmail4, a mail
retriever with support for POP3, IMAP4 and SDPS, that could allow
man-in-the-middle attacks.


* [CVE-2014-7273](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7273)
The IMAP-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.0.0 through 4.43.0
 does not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof IMAP servers and obtain
 sensitive information via a crafted certificate.
* [CVE-2014-7274](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7274)
The IMAP-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.44.0 does not verify
 that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's
 Common Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof IMAP servers and obtain
 sensitive information via a crafted certificate from a recognized
 Certification Authority.
* [CVE-2014-7275](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7275)
The POP3-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.0.0 through 4.44.0
 does not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof POP3 servers and obtain
 sensitive information via a crafted certificate.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.46.0-1~deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.46.0-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.46.0-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your getmail4 packages.
