Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3087-1 qemu -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
04 Dec 2014
Affected Packages:

[qemu](https://packages.debian.org/src:qemu)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-8106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8106).  

More information:

Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat discovered that the blit region checks were
insufficient in the Cirrus VGA emulator in qemu, a fast processor
emulator. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to write into qemu
address space on the host, potentially escalating their privileges to
those of the qemu host process.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u6.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.
