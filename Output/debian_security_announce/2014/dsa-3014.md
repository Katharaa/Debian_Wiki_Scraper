DSA-3014-1 squid3 -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
28 Aug 2014
Affected Packages:

[squid3](https://packages.debian.org/src:squid3)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 759509](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=759509).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3609](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3609).  

More information:

Matthew Daley discovered that Squid3, a fully featured web proxy cache,
did not properly perform input validation in request parsing. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to mount a denial of service by sending
crafted Range requests.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.20-2.2+deb7u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.
