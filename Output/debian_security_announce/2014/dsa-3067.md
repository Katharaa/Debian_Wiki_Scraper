More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware.


* [CVE-2014-3689](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3689)
The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security reported that
 guest provided parameter were insufficiently validated in
 rectangle functions in the vmware-vga driver. A privileged guest
 user could use this flaw to write into qemu address space on the
 host, potentially escalating their privileges to those of the
 qemu host process.
* [CVE-2014-7815](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7815)
James Spadaro of Cisco reported insufficiently sanitized
 bits\_per\_pixel from the client in the QEMU VNC display driver. An
 attacker having access to the guest's VNC console could use this
 flaw to crash the guest.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u5.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
