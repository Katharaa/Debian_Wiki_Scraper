Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3012-1 eglibc -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
27 Aug 2014
Affected Packages:

[eglibc](https://packages.debian.org/src:eglibc)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-5119](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5119).  

More information:

Tavis Ormandy discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the
transliteration module loading code in eglibc, Debian's version of the
GNU C Library. As a result, an attacker who can supply a crafted
destination character set argument to iconv-related character
conversation functions could achieve arbitrary code execution.


This update removes support of loadable gconv transliteration modules.
Besides the security vulnerability, the module loading code had
functionality defects which prevented it from working for the intended
purpose.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.13-38+deb7u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.
