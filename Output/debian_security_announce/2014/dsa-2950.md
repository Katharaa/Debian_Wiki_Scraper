For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u10. All applications linked to openssl need to
be restarted. You can use the tool checkrestart from the package
debian-goodies to detect affected programs or reboot your system. There's
also a forthcoming security update for the Linux kernel later the day
([CVE-2014-3153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3153)), so you need to reboot anyway. Perfect timing, isn't it?


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
