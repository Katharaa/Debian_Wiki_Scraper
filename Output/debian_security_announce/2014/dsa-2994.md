More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in nss, the Mozilla Network
Security Service library:


* [CVE-2013-1741](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1741)
Runaway memset in certificate parsing on 64-bit computers leading to
 a crash by attempting to write 4Gb of nulls.
* [CVE-2013-5606](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-5606)
Certificate validation with the verifylog mode did not return
 validation errors, but instead expected applications to determine
 the status by looking at the log.
* [CVE-2014-1491](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1491)
Ticket handling protection mechanisms bypass due to the lack of
 restriction of public values in Diffie-Hellman key exchanges.
* [CVE-2014-1492](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1492)
Incorrect IDNA domain name matching for wildcard certificates could
 allow specially-crafted invalid certificates to be considered as
 valid.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.14.5-1+deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 2:3.16-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.
