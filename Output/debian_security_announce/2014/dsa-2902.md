 the wrong connection when asked to do transfers using other
 protocols than HTTP and FTP.
* [CVE-2014-0139](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0139)
Richard Moore from Westpoint Ltd. reported that libcurl does not
 behave compliant to RFC 2828 under certain conditions and
 incorrectly validates wildcard SSL certificates containing literal
 IP addresses.
