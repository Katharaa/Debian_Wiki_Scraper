========================


DSA-2863-1 libtar -- directory traversal
----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Feb 2014
Affected Packages:

[libtar](https://packages.debian.org/src:libtar)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 731860](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=731860).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-4420](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4420).  

More information:

A directory traversal attack was reported against libtar, a C library for
manipulating tar archives. The application does not validate the
filenames inside the tar archive, allowing to extract files in arbitrary
path. An attacker can craft a tar file to override files beyond the
tar\_extract\_glob and tar\_extract\_all prefix parameter.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.11-6+deb6u2.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.16-1+deb7u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.20-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your libtar packages.
