DSA-2952-1 kfreebsd-9 -- security update
----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
05 Jun 2014
Affected Packages:

[kfreebsd-9](https://packages.debian.org/src:kfreebsd-9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-1453](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1453), [CVE-2014-3000](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3000), [CVE-2014-3880](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3880).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FreeBSD kernel that may
lead to a denial of service or possibly disclosure of kernel memory. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2014-1453](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1453)
A remote, authenticated attacker could cause the NFS server become
 deadlocked, resulting in a denial of service.
* [CVE-2014-3000](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3000):
 An attacker who can send a series of specifically crafted packets with a
 connection could cause a denial of service situation by causing the kernel
 to crash.


Additionally, because the undefined on stack memory may be overwritten by
 other kernel threads, while difficult, it may be possible for an attacker
 to construct a carefully crafted attack to obtain portion of kernel memory
 via a connected socket. This may result in the disclosure of sensitive
 information such as login credentials, etc. before or even without
 crashing the system.
* [CVE-2014-3880](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3880)
A local attacker can trigger a kernel crash (triple fault) with potential
 data loss, related to the execve/fexecve system calls.
 Reported by Ivo De Decker.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.0-10+deb70.7.


For the unstable (sid) and testing (jessie) distributions, these problems are fixed
in kfreebsd-10 version 10.0-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-9 packages.
