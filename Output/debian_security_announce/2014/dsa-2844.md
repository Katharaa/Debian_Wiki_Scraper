DSA-2844-1 djvulibre -- arbitrary code execution
------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
15 Jan 2014
Affected Packages:

[djvulibre](https://packages.debian.org/src:djvulibre)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-6535](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6535).  

More information:

It was discovered that djvulibre, the Open Source DjVu implementation
project, can be crashed or possibly make it execute arbitrary code when
processing a specially crafted djvu file.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.23-3+squeeze1.


This problem has been fixed before the release of the stable distribution
(wheezy), therefore it is not affected.


We recommend that you upgrade your djvulibre packages.
