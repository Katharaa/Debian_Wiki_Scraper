========================


DSA-2868-1 php5 -- denial of service
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
02 Mar 2014
Affected Packages:

[php5](https://packages.debian.org/src:php5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 739012](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=739012).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-1943](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1943).  

More information:

It was discovered that file, a file type classification tool, contains a
flaw in the handling of indirect magic rules in the libmagic library,
which leads to an infinite recursion when trying to determine the file
type of certain files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
ID [CVE-2014-1943](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1943) has been assigned to identify this flaw. Additionally,
other well-crafted files might result in long computation times (while
using 100% CPU) and overlong results.


This update corrects this flaw in the copy that is embedded in the
php5 package.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze19.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14+deb7u8.


For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
