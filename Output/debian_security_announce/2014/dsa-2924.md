More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client: multiple memory safety
errors, buffer overflows, missing permission checks, out of bound reads,
use-after-frees and other implementation errors may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation, cross-site scripting
or denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.5.0-1~deb7u1.


For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.5.0-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.5.0-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
