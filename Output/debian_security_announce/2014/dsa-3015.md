More information:

A heap-based overflow vulnerability was found in the way Lua, a
simple, extensible, embeddable programming language, handles varargs
functions with many fixed parameters called with few arguments,
leading to application crashes or, potentially, arbitrary code
execution.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.5-4+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.5-7.


We recommend that you upgrade your lua5.1 packages.
