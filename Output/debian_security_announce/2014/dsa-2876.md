More information:

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in the pdftoopvp CUPS filter, which could result in the
execution of aribitrary code if a malformed PDF file is processed.


For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-7+squeeze4.


For the stable distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid)

We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.
