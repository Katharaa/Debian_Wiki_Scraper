More information:

Antoine Delignat-Lavaud from Inria discovered an issue in the way NSS
(the Mozilla Network Security Service library) was parsing ASN.1 data
used in signatures, making it vulnerable to a signature forgery attack.


An attacker could craft ASN.1 data to forge RSA certificates with a
valid certification chain to a trusted CA.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.14.5-1+deb7u2.


For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.17.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.
