========================


DSA-3104-1 bsd-mailx -- security update
---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
16 Dec 2014
Affected Packages:

[bsd-mailx](https://packages.debian.org/src:bsd-mailx)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-7844](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7844).  

More information:

It was discovered that bsd-mailx, an implementation of the mail
command, had an undocumented feature which treats syntactically valid
email addresses as shell commands to execute.


Users who need this feature can re-enable it using the expandaddr in
an appropriate mailrc file. This update also removes the obsolete
`-T` option. An older security vulnerability,
[CVE-2004-2771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-2771), had already been addressed in the Debian's bsd-mailx
package.


Note that this security update does not remove all mailx facilities
for command execution, though. Scripts which send mail to addresses
obtained from an untrusted source (such as a web form) should use the
`--` separator before the email addresses (which was fixed to work
properly in this update), or they should be changed to invoke
`mail -t` or `sendmail -i -t` instead, passing the
recipient addresses as part of the mail header.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.1.2-0.20111106cvs-1+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your bsd-mailx packages.
