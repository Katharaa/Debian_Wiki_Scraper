More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in krb5, the MIT implementation
of Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:


* [CVE-2014-4341](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4341)
An unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to inject
 packets into a legitimately established GSSAPI application session
 can cause a program crash due to invalid memory references when
 attempting to read beyond the end of a buffer.
* [CVE-2014-4342](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4342)
An unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to inject
 packets into a legitimately established GSSAPI application session
 can cause a program crash due to invalid memory references when
 reading beyond the end of a buffer or by causing a null pointer
 dereference.
* [CVE-2014-4343](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4343)
An unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to spoof packets
 appearing to be from a GSSAPI acceptor can cause a double-free
 condition in GSSAPI initiators (clients) which are using the SPNEGO
 mechanism, by returning a different underlying mechanism than was
 proposed by the initiator. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw
 to cause an application crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2014-4344](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4344)
An unauthenticated or partially authenticated remote attacker can
 cause a NULL dereference and application crash during a SPNEGO
 negotiation by sending an empty token as the second or later context
 token from initiator to acceptor.
* [CVE-2014-4345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4345)
When kadmind is configured to use LDAP for the KDC database, an
 authenticated remote attacker can cause it to perform an
 out-of-bounds write (buffer overflow).


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.1+dfsg-7.


We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.
