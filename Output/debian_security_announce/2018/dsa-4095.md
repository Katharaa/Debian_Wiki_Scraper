DSA-4095-1 gcab -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 Jan 2018
Affected Packages:

[gcab](https://packages.debian.org/src:gcab)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 887776](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=887776).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-5345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5345).  

More information:

It was discovered that gcab, a Microsoft Cabinet file manipulation tool,
is prone to a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability when extracting
.cab files. An attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
denial-of-service or, potentially the execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running gcab, if a specially crafted .cab
file is processed.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your gcab packages.
