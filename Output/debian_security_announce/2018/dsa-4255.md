DSA-4255-1 ant -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 Jul 2018
Affected Packages:

[ant](https://packages.debian.org/src:ant)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-10886](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10886).  

More information:

Danny Grander reported that the unzip and untar tasks in ant, a Java
based build tool like make, allow the extraction of files outside a
target directory. An attacker can take advantage of this flaw by
submitting a specially crafted Zip or Tar archive to an ant build to
overwrite any file writable by the user running ant.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.9-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ant packages.
