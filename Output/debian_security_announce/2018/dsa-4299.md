Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 909317](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=909317).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-17407](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-17407).  

More information:

Nick Roessler from the University of Pennsylvania has found a buffer overflow
in texlive-bin, the executables for TexLive, the popular distribution of TeX
document production system.


This buffer overflow can be used for arbitrary code execution by crafting a
special type1 font (.pfb) and provide it to users running pdf(la)tex, dvips or
luatex in a way that the font is loaded.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2016.20160513.41080.dfsg-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your texlive-bin packages.
