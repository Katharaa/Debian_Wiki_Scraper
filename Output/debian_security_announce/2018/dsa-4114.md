More information:

It was discovered that jackson-databind, a Java library used to parse
JSON and other data formats, did not properly validate user input
before attempting deserialization. This allowed an attacker to perform
code execution by providing maliciously crafted input.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.4.2-2+deb8u3.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.6-1+deb9u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your jackson-databind packages.
