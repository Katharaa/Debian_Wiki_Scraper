More information:

Several heap buffer overflows were found in discount, an implementation
of the Markdown markup language, that could be triggered with specially
crafted Markdown data and would cause discount to read past the end of
internal buffers.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.2-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your discount packages.
