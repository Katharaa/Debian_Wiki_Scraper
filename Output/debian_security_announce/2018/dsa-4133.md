More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ISC DHCP client,
relay and server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2017-3144](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3144)
It was discovered that the DHCP server does not properly clean up
 closed OMAPI connections, which can lead to exhaustion of the pool
 of socket descriptors available to the DHCP server, resulting in
 denial of service.
* [CVE-2018-5732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5732)
Felix Wilhelm of the Google Security Team discovered that the DHCP
 client is prone to an out-of-bound memory access vulnerability when
 processing specially constructed DHCP options responses, resulting
 in potential execution of arbitrary code by a malicious DHCP server.
* [CVE-2018-5733](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5733)
Felix Wilhelm of the Google Security Team discovered that the DHCP
 server does not properly handle reference counting when processing
 client requests. A malicious client can take advantage of this flaw
 to cause a denial of service (dhcpd crash) by sending large amounts
 of traffic.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.3.1-6+deb8u3.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.5-3+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.
