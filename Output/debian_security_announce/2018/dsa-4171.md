-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
13 Apr 2018
Affected Packages:

[ruby-loofah](https://packages.debian.org/src:ruby-loofah)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 893596](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=893596).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-8048](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8048).  

More information:

The Shopify Application Security Team reported that ruby-loofah, a
general library for manipulating and transforming HTML/XML documents and
fragments, allows non-whitelisted attributes to be present in sanitized
output when input with specially-crafted HTML fragments. This might
allow to mount a code injection attack into a browser consuming
sanitized output.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.3-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-loofah packages.
