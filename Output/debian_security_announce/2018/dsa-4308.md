More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2018-6554](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6554)
A memory leak in the irda\_bind function in the irda subsystem was
 discovered. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
 denial of service (memory consumption).
* [CVE-2018-6555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6555)
A flaw was discovered in the irda\_setsockopt function in the irda
 subsystem, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service
 (use-after-free and system crash).
* [CVE-2018-7755](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7755)
Brian Belleville discovered a flaw in the fd\_locked\_ioctl function
 in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. The floppy driver copies a
 kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. A
 local user with access to a floppy drive device can take advantage
 of this flaw to discover the location kernel code and data.
* [CVE-2018-9363](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-9363)
It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
 correctly check the length of received report messages. A paired
 HIDP device could use this to cause a buffer overflow, leading to
 denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or potentially
 remote code execution.
* [CVE-2018-9516](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-9516)
It was discovered that the HID events interface in debugfs did not
 correctly limit the length of copies to user buffers. A local
 user with access to these files could use this to cause a
 denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
 privilege escalation. However, by default debugfs is only
 accessible by the root user.
* [CVE-2018-10902](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10902)
It was discovered that the rawmidi kernel driver does not protect
 against concurrent access which leads to a double-realloc (double
 free) flaw. A local attacker can take advantage of this issue for
 privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2018-10938](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10938)
Yves Younan from Cisco reported that the Cipso IPv4 module did not
 correctly check the length of IPv4 options. On custom kernels with
 CONFIG\_NETLABEL enabled, a remote attacker could use this to cause
 a denial of service (hang).
* [CVE-2018-13099](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-13099)
Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a use-after-free bug in the
 F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount a crafted F2FS
 volume could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
 memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2018-14609](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14609)
Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
 dereference in the F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount
 a crafted F2FS volume could use this to cause a denial of service
 (crash).
* [CVE-2018-14617](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14617)
Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
 dereference in the HFS+ implementation. An attacker able to mount
 a crafted HFS+ volume could use this to cause a denial of service
 (crash).
* [CVE-2018-14633](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14633)
Vincent Pelletier discovered a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in
 the chap\_server\_compute\_md5() function in the iSCSI target code. An
 unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
 cause a denial of service or possibly to get a non-authorized access
 to data exported by an iSCSI target.
* [CVE-2018-14678](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14678)
M. Vefa Bicakci and Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the
 kernel exit code used on amd64 systems running as Xen PV guests.
 A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).
* [CVE-2018-14734](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14734)
A use-after-free bug was discovered in the InfiniBand
 communication manager. A local user could use this to cause a
 denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possible for
 privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2018-15572](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-15572)
Esmaiel Mohammadian Koruyeh, Khaled Khasawneh, Chengyu Song, and
 Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, from University of California, Riverside,
 reported a variant of Spectre variant 2, dubbed SpectreRSB. A
 local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
 from processes owned by other users.
* [CVE-2018-15594](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-15594)
Nadav Amit reported that some indirect function calls used in
 paravirtualised guests were vulnerable to Spectre variant 2. A
 local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
 from the kernel.
* [CVE-2018-16276](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16276)
Jann Horn discovered that the yurex driver did not correctly limit
 the length of copies to user buffers. A local user with access to
 a yurex device node could use this to cause a denial of service
 (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2018-16658](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16658)
It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
 validate the parameter to the CDROM\_DRIVE\_STATUS ioctl. A user
 with access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
 information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
 (crash).
* [CVE-2018-17182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-17182)
Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache\_flush\_all function mishandles
 sequence number overflows. A local user can take advantage of this
 flaw to trigger a use-after-free, causing a denial of service
 (crash or memory corruption) or privilege escalation.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.110-3+deb9u5.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
