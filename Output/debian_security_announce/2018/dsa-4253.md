--------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
23 Jul 2018
Affected Packages:

[network-manager-vpnc](https://packages.debian.org/src:network-manager-vpnc)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 904255](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=904255).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-10900](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10900).  

More information:

Denis Andzakovic discovered that network-manager-vpnc, a plugin to
provide VPNC support for NetworkManager, is prone to a privilege
escalation vulnerability. A newline character can be used to inject a
Password helper parameter into the configuration data passed to vpnc,
allowing a local user with privileges to modify a system connection to
execute arbitrary commands as root.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.4-4+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your network-manager-vpnc packages.
