DSA-4261-1 vim-syntastic -- security update
-------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
03 Aug 2018
Affected Packages:

[vim-syntastic](https://packages.debian.org/src:vim-syntastic)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-11319](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-11319).  

More information:

Enrico Zini discovered a vulnerability in Syntastic, an addon
module for the Vim editor that runs a file through external checkers
and displays any resulting errors. Config files were looked up in the
current working directory which could result in arbitrary
shell code execution if a malformed source code file is opened.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.0-1+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your vim-syntastic packages.
