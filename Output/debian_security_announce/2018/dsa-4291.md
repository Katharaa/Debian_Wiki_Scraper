DSA-4291-1 mgetty -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
11 Sep 2018
Affected Packages:

[mgetty](https://packages.debian.org/src:mgetty)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-16741](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16741).  

More information:

Two input sanitization failures have been found in the faxrunq and faxq
binaries in mgetty, a smart modem getty replacement. An attacker could leverage
them to insert commands via shell metacharacters in jobs id and have them
executed with the privilege of the faxrunq/faxq user.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.36-3+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your mgetty packages.
