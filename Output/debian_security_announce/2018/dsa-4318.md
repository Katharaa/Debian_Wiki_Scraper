More information:

Nitin Venkatesh discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability in moin,
a Python clone of WikiWiki. A remote attacker can conduct cross-site
scripting attacks via the GUI editor's link dialogue. This only affects
installations which have set up fckeditor (not enabled by default).


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.9-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your moin packages.
