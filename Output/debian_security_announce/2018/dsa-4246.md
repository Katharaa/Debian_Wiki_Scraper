More information:

Toshitsugu Yoneyama of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc. discovered
that mailman, a web-based mailing list manager, is prone to a cross-site
scripting flaw allowing a malicious listowner to inject scripts into the
listinfo page, due to not validated input in the host\_name field.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.1.23-1+deb9u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your mailman packages.
