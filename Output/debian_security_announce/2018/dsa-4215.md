More information:

Man Yue Mo, Lars Krapf and Pierre Ernst discovered that Batik, a
toolkit for processing SVG images, did not properly validate its
input. This would allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service,
mount cross-site scripting attacks, or access restricted files on the
server.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.7+dfsg-5+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8-4+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your batik packages.
