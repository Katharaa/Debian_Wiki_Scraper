-------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[ruby2.3](https://packages.debian.org/src:ruby2.3)

Vulnerable:

Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-16395](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16395), [CVE-2018-16396](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16396).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Ruby language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2018-16395](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16395)
Tyler Eckstein reported that the equality check of
 OpenSSL::X509::Name could return true for non-equal objects. If a
 malicious X.509 certificate is passed to compare with an existing
 certificate, there is a possibility to be judged incorrectly that
 they are equal.
* [CVE-2018-16396](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16396)
Chris Seaton discovered that tainted flags are not propagated in
 Array#pack and String#unpack with some directives.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3.3-1+deb9u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby2.3 packages.
