Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-4134-1 util-linux -- security update
----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Mar 2018
Affected Packages:

[util-linux](https://packages.debian.org/src:util-linux)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 892179](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=892179).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-7738](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7738).  

More information:

Bjorn Bosselmann discovered that the umount bash completion from
util-linux does not properly handle embedded shell commands in a
mountpoint name. An attacker with rights to mount filesystems can take
advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation if a user (in particular
root) is tricked into using the umount completion while a specially
crafted mount is present.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.29.2-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your util-linux packages.
