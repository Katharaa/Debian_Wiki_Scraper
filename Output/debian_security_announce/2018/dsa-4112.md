Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-17563](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17563), [CVE-2017-17564](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17564), [CVE-2017-17565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17565), [CVE-2017-17566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17566).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor:


* [CVE-2017-17563](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17563)
Jan Beulich discovered that an incorrect reference count overflow
 check in x86 shadow mode may result in denial of service or
 privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2017-17564](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17564)
Jan Beulich discovered that improper x86 shadow mode reference count
 error handling may result in denial of service or privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2017-17565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17565)
Jan Beulich discovered that an incomplete bug check in x86 log-dirty
 handling may result in denial of service.
* [CVE-2017-17566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17566)
Jan Beulich discovered that x86 PV guests may gain access to
 internally used pages which could result in denial of service or
 potential privilege escalation.


In addition this update ships the Comet shim to address the Meltdown
class of vulnerabilities for guests with legacy PV kernels. In addition,
the package provides the Xen PTI stage 1 mitigation which is built-in
and enabled by default on Intel systems, but can be disabled with
`xpti=false' on the hypervisor command line (It does not make sense to
use both xpti and the Comet shim.)


Please refer to the following URL for more details on how to configure
individual mitigation strategies:
<https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-254.html>


Additional information can also be found in README.pti and README.comet.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.8.3+comet2+shim4.10.0+comet3-1+deb9u4.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.
