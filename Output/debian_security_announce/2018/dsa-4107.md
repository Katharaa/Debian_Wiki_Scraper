--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Feb 2018
Affected Packages:

[django-anymail](https://packages.debian.org/src:django-anymail)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 889450](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=889450).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-6596](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6596).  

More information:

It was discovered that the webhook validation of Anymail, a Django email
backends for multiple ESPs, is prone to a timing attack. A remote
attacker can take advantage of this flaw to obtain a
WEBHOOK\_AUTHORIZATION secret and post arbitrary email tracking events.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your django-anymail packages.
