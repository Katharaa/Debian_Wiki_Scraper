More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Exiv2, a C++ library and
a command line utility to manage image metadata which could result in
denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed file
is parsed.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
