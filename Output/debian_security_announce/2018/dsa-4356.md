More information:

Jacob Baines discovered a flaw in the handling of the DSI Opensession
command in Netatalk, an implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite,
allowing an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.5-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your netatalk packages.
