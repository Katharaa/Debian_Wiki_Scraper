More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a web blogging

various Cross-Side Scripting (XSS) and Server-Side Request Forgery
(SSRF) attacks, as well as bypass some access restrictions.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.1+dfsg-1+deb8u16.
