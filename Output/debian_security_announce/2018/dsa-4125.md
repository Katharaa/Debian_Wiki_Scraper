More information:

Joonun Jang discovered several problems in wavpack, an audio
compression format suite. Incorrect processing of input resulted in
several heap- and stack-based buffer overflows, leading to application
crash or potential code execution.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.0.0-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your wavpack packages.
