More information:

Lalith Rallabhandi discovered that OmniAuth, a Ruby library for
implementing multi-provider authentication in web applications,
mishandled and leaked sensitive information. An attacker with access to
the callback environment, such as in the case of a crafted web
application, can request authentication services from this module and
access to the CSRF token.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.2.1-1+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-omniauth packages.
