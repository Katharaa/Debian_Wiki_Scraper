Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 908324](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=908324).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-16657](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16657).  

More information:

Henning Westerholt discovered a flaw related to the Via header
processing in kamailio, a very fast, dynamic and configurable SIP
server. An unauthenticated attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
mount a denial of service attack via a specially crafted SIP message
with an invalid Via header.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.4-2+deb9u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your kamailio packages.
