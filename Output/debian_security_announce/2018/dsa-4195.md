More information:

Harry Sintonen discovered that wget, a network utility to retrieve files
from the web, does not properly handle '\r\n' from continuation lines
while parsing the Set-Cookie HTTP header. A malicious web server could
use this flaw to inject arbitrary cookies to the cookie jar file, adding
new or replacing existing cookie values.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.16-1+deb8u5.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.18-5+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your wget packages.
