More information:

Integer overflows in the processing of packets in network cards emulated
by QEMU, a fast processor emulator, could result in denial of service.


In addition this update backports support to passthrough the new CPU
features added in the intel-microcode update shipped in DSA 4273 to
x86-based guests.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u5.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.
