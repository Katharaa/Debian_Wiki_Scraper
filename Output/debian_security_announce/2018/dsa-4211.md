---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
25 May 2018
Affected Packages:

[xdg-utils](https://packages.debian.org/src:xdg-utils)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 898317](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=898317).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-18266](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18266).  

More information:

Gabriel Corona discovered that xdg-utils, a set of tools for desktop
environment integration, is vulnerable to argument injection attacks. If
the environment variable BROWSER in the victim host has a "%s" and the
victim opens a link crafted by an attacker with xdg-open, the malicious
party could manipulate the parameters used by the browser when opened.
This manipulation could set, for example, a proxy to which the network
traffic could be intercepted for that particular execution.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.1.0~rc1+git20111210-7.4+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.1-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your xdg-utils packages.
