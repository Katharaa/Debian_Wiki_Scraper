More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library.


* [CVE-2018-1000120](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000120)
Duy Phan Thanh discovered that curl could be fooled into writing a
 zero byte out of bounds when curl is told to work on an FTP URL with
 the setting to only issue a single CWD command, if the directory part
 of the URL contains a “%00” sequence.
* [CVE-2018-1000121](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000121)
Dario Weisser discovered that curl might dereference a near-NULL
 address when getting an LDAP URL due to the ldap\_get\_attribute\_ber()
 function returning LDAP\_SUCCESS and a NULL pointer. A malicious server
 might cause libcurl-using applications that allow LDAP URLs, or that
 allow redirects to LDAP URLs to crash.
* [CVE-2018-1000122](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000122)
OSS-fuzz, assisted by Max Dymond, discovered that curl could be
 tricked into copying data beyond the end of its heap based buffer
 when asked to transfer an RTSP URL.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.38.0-4+deb8u10.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.52.1-5+deb9u5.


We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
