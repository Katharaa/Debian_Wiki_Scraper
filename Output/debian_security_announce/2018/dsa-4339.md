More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Ceph, a distributed storage
and file system: The cephx authentication protocol was suspectible to
replay attacks and calculated signatures incorrectly, ceph mon did not
validate capabilities for pool operations (resulting in potential
corruption or deletion of snapshot images) and a format string
vulnerability in libradosstriper could result in denial of service.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.2.11-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ceph packages.
