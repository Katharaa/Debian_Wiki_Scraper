More information:

The Qualys Research Labs discovered multiple vulnerabilities in procps,
a set of command line and full screen utilities for browsing procfs. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:


* [CVE-2018-1122](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1122)
top read its configuration from the current working directory if no
 $HOME was configured. If top were started from a directory writable
 by the attacker (such as /tmp) this could result in local privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2018-1123](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1123)
Denial of service against the ps invocation of another user.
* [CVE-2018-1124](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1124)
An integer overflow in the file2strvec() function of libprocps could
 result in local privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2018-1125](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1125)
A stack-based buffer overflow in pgrep could result in denial
 of service for a user using pgrep for inspecting a specially
 crafted process.
* [CVE-2018-1126](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1126)
Incorrect integer size parameters used in wrappers for standard C
 allocators could cause integer truncation and lead to integer
 overflow issues.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:3.3.9-9+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.3.12-3+deb9u1.
