More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.


* [CVE-2018-5390](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5390)
Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that a remote attacker can trigger the
 worst case code paths for TCP stream reassembly with low rates of
 specially crafted packets leading to remote denial of service.
* [CVE-2018-13405](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-13405)
Jann Horn discovered that the inode\_init\_owner function in
 fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel allows local users to create files
 with an unintended group ownership allowing attackers to escalate
 privileges by making a plain file executable and SGID.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.110-3+deb9u1. This update includes fixes for several
regressions in the latest point release.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
