Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2018-1050](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1050)

* [CVE-2018-1057](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1057)

 passwords, including administrative users.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), CVE-2018-1050 will be addressed
in a later update. Unfortunately the changes required to fix
CVE-2018-1057 for Debian oldstable are too invasive to be backported.
Users using Samba as an AD-compatible domain controller are encouraged
to apply the workaround described in the Samba wiki and upgrade to
Debian stretch.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.5.12+dfsg-2+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
