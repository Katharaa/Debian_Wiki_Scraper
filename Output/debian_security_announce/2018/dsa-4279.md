DSA-4279-1 linux -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
20 Aug 2018
Affected Packages:

[linux](https://packages.debian.org/src:linux)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-3620](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-3620), [CVE-2018-3646](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-3646).  

More information:

Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in the way the
Intel processor designs have implemented speculative execution of
instructions in combination with handling of page-faults. This flaw
could allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read
memory from arbitrary (non-user controlled) addresses, including from
the kernel and all other processes running on the system or cross
guest/host boundaries to read host memory.


To fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary to install
updated CPU microcode (only available in Debian non-free). Common server
class CPUs are covered in the update released as DSA 4273-1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.110-3+deb9u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
