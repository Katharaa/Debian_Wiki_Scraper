More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in PolarSSL, a lightweight
crypto and SSL/TLS library, that allowed a remote attacker to either
cause a denial-of-service by application crash, or execute arbitrary
code.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.3.9-2.1+deb8u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.
