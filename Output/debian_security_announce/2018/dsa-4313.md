-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
08 Oct 2018
Affected Packages:

[linux](https://packages.debian.org/src:linux)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-15471](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-15471), [CVE-2018-18021](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-18021).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2018-15471](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-15471) (XSA-270)
 Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero discovered a flaw in the hash
 handling of the xen-netback Linux kernel module. A malicious or
 buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged) backend to make
 out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in privilege
 escalation, denial of service, or information leaks.

* [CVE-2018-18021](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-18021)
It was discovered that the KVM subsystem on the arm64 platform does
 not properly handle the KVM\_SET\_ON\_REG ioctl. An attacker who can
 create KVM based virtual machines can take advantage of this flaw
 for denial of service (hypervisor panic) or privilege escalation
 (arbitrarily redirect the hypervisor flow of control with full
 register control).


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.110-3+deb9u6.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
