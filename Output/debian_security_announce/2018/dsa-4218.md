More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in memcached, a high-performance
memory object caching system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2017-9951](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9951)
Daniel Shapira reported a heap-based buffer over-read in memcached
 (resulting from an incomplete fix for [CVE-2016-8705](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8705)) triggered by
 specially crafted requests to add/set a key and allowing a remote
 attacker to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2018-1000115](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000115)
It was reported that memcached listens to UDP by default. A remote
 attacker can take advantage of it to use the memcached service as a
 DDoS amplifier.


Default installations of memcached in Debian are not affected by
 this issue as the installation defaults to listen only on localhost.
 This update disables the UDP port by default. Listening on the UDP
 can be re-enabled in the /etc/memcached.conf (cf.
 /usr/share/doc/memcached/NEWS.Debian.gz).
* [CVE-2018-1000127](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000127)
An integer overflow was reported in memcached, resulting in resource
 leaks, data corruption, deadlocks or crashes.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.21-1.1+deb8u2.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.33-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your memcached packages.
