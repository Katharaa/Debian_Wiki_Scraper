More information:

Magnus Klaaborg Stubman discovered a NULL pointer dereference bug in
net-snmp, a suite of Simple Network Management Protocol applications,
allowing a remote, authenticated attacker to crash the snmpd process
(causing a denial of service).


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.7.3+dfsg-1.7+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your net-snmp packages.
