DSA-4267-1 kamailio -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
08 Aug 2018
Affected Packages:

[kamailio](https://packages.debian.org/src:kamailio)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-14767](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14767).  

More information:

Henning Westerholt discovered a flaw related to the To header processing
in kamailio, a very fast, dynamic and configurable SIP server. Missing
input validation in the build\_res\_buf\_from\_sip\_req function could result
in denial of service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.4-2+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your kamailio packages.
