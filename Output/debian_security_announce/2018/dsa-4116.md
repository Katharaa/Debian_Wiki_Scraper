DSA-4116-1 plasma-workspace -- security update
----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
16 Feb 2018
Affected Packages:

[plasma-workspace](https://packages.debian.org/src:plasma-workspace)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-6791](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6791).  

More information:

Krzysztof Sieluzycki discovered that the notifier for removable devices
in the KDE Plasma workspace performed insufficient sanitisation of
FAT/VFAT volume labels, which could result in the execution of arbitrary
shell commands if a removable device with a malformed disk label is
mounted.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:5.8.6-2.1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your plasma-workspace packages.
