More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.


* [CVE-2018-1087](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1087)
Andy Lutomirski discovered that the KVM implementation did not
 properly handle #DB exceptions while deferred by MOV SS/POP SS,
 allowing an unprivileged KVM guest user to crash the guest or
 potentially escalate their privileges.
* [CVE-2018-8897](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8897)
Nick Peterson of Everdox Tech LLC discovered that #DB exceptions
 that are deferred by MOV SS or POP SS are not properly handled,
 allowing an unprivileged user to crash the kernel and cause a denial
 of service.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.56-1+deb8u1. This update includes various fixes for
regressions from 3.16.56-1 as released in DSA-4187-1 (Cf. #897427, #898067 and #898100).


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.88-1+deb9u1. The fix for [CVE-2018-1108](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1108) applied in DSA-4188-1
is temporarily reverted due to various regression, cf. #897599.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
