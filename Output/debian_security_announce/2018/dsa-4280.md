Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 906236](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=906236).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-15473](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-15473).  

More information:

Dariusz Tytko, Michal Sajdak and Qualys Security discovered that
OpenSSH, an implementation of the SSH protocol suite, was prone to a
user enumeration vulnerability. This would allow a remote attacker to
check whether a specific user account existed on the target server.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:7.4p1-10+deb9u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.
