More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libsmpack, a library used to
handle Microsoft compression formats. A remote attacker could craft
malicious CAB, CHM or KWAJ files and use these flaws to cause a denial
of service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5-1+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your libmspack packages.
