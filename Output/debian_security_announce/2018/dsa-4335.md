In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-16843](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16843), [CVE-2018-16844](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16844), [CVE-2018-16845](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16845).  

More information:

Three vulnerabilities were discovered in Nginx, a high-performance web
and reverse proxy server, which could result in denial of service in processing
HTTP/2 (via excessive memory/CPU usage) or server memory disclosure in
the ngx\_http\_mp4\_module module (used for server-side MP4 streaming).


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.10.3-1+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.
