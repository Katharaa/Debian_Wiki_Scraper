Affected Packages:

[xml-security-c](https://packages.debian.org/src:xml-security-c)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
No other external database security references currently available.
More information:

It was discovered that the Apache XML Security for C++ library performed
insufficient validation of KeyInfo hints, which could result in denial
of service via NULL pointer dereferences when processing malformed XML
data.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.3-4+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your xml-security-c packages.
