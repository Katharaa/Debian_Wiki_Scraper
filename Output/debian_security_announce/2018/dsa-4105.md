In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 888654](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=888654).

More information:

It was discovered that mpv, a media player, was vulnerable to remote code
execution attacks. An attacker could craft a malicious web page that,
when used as an argument in mpv, could execute arbitrary code in the host
of the mpv user.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.23.0-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your mpv packages.
