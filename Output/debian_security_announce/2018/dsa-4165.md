More information:

Michal Kedzior found two vulnerabilities in LDAP Account Manager, a web
front-end for LDAP directories.


* [CVE-2018-8763](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8763)
The found Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability might
 allow an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the browser of the
 victim or to redirect her to a malicious website if the victim clicks
 on a specially crafted link.
* [CVE-2018-8764](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8764)
The application leaks the CSRF token in the URL, which can be use by
 an attacker to perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack, in which
 a victim logged in LDAP Account Manager might performed unwanted
 actions in the front-end by clicking on a link crafted by the
 attacker.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.7.1-1+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
