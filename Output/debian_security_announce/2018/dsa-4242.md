--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
09 Jul 2018
Affected Packages:

[ruby-sprockets](https://packages.debian.org/src:ruby-sprockets)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 901913](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=901913).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-3760](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-3760).  

More information:

Orange Tsai discovered a path traversal flaw in ruby-sprockets, a
Rack-based asset packaging system. A remote attacker can take advantage
of this flaw to read arbitrary files outside an application's root
directory via specially crafted requests, when the Sprockets server is
used in production.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.0-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-sprockets packages.
