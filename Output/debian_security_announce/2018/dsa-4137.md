More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Libvirt, a virtualisation
abstraction library:


* [CVE-2018-1064](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1064)
Daniel Berrange discovered that the QEMU guest agent performed
 insufficient validation of incoming data, which allows a privileged
 user in the guest to exhaust resources on the virtualisation host,
 resulting in denial of service.
* [CVE-2018-5748](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5748)
Daniel Berrange and Peter Krempa discovered that the QEMU monitor
 was susceptible to denial of service by memory exhaustion. This was
 already fixed in Debian stretch and only affects Debian jessie.
* [CVE-2018-6764](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6764)
Pedro Sampaio discovered that LXC containers detected the hostname
 insecurely. This only affects Debian stretch.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.9-9+deb8u5.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.0-4+deb9u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.
