More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in SimpleSAMLphp, a
framework for authentication, primarily via the SAML protocol.


* [CVE-2017-12867](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12867)
Attackers with access to a secret token could extend its validity
 period by manipulating the prepended time offset.
* [CVE-2017-12869](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12869)
When using the multiauth module, attackers can bypass authentication
 context restrictions and use any authentication source defined in
 the config.
* [CVE-2017-12873](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12873)
Defensive measures have been taken to prevent the administrator
 from misconfiguring persistent NameIDs to avoid identifier clash.
 (Affects Debian 8 Jessie only.)
* [CVE-2017-12874](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12874)
The InfoCard module could accept incorrectly signed XML messages
 in rare occasions.
* [CVE-2017-18121](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18121)
The consentAdmin module was vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting
 attack, allowing an attacker to craft links that could execute
 arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
* [CVE-2017-18122](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18122)
The (deprecated) SAML 1.1 implementation would regard as valid any
 unsigned SAML response containing more than one signed assertion,
 provided that the signature of at least one of the assertions was
 valid, allowing an attacker that could obtain a valid signed
 assertion from an IdP to impersonate users from that IdP.
* [CVE-2018-6519](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6519)
Regular expression denial of service when parsing extraordinarily
 long timestamps.
* [CVE-2018-6521](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6521)
Change sqlauth module MySQL charset from utf8 to utf8mb to
 prevent theoretical query truncation that could allow remote
 attackers to bypass intended access restrictions
* [CVE-2018-7644](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7644)
Critical signature validation vulnerability.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.13.1-2+deb8u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.14.11-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your simplesamlphp packages.
