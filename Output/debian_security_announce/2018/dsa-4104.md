More information:

'landave' discovered a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the
NCompress::NShrink::CDecoder::CodeReal method in p7zip, a 7zr file
archiver with high compression ratio. A remote attacker can take
advantage of this flaw to cause a denial-of-service or, potentially the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
p7zip, if a specially crafted shrinked ZIP archive is processed.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 9.20.1~dfsg.1-4.1+deb8u3.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 16.02+dfsg-3+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your p7zip packages.
