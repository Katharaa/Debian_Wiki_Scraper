Affected Packages:

[cgit](https://packages.debian.org/src:cgit)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 905382](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=905382).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-14912](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14912).  

More information:

Jann Horn discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in cgit, a fast
web frontend for git repositories written in C. A remote attacker can
take advantage of this flaw to retrieve arbitrary files via a specially
crafted request, when 'enable-http-clone=1' (default) is not turned off.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1+git2.10.2-3+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your cgit packages.
