Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 891639](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=891639).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-7490](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7490).  

More information:

Marios Nicolaides discovered that the PHP plugin in uWSGI, a fast,
self-healing application container server, does not properly handle a
DOCUMENT\_ROOT check during use of the --php-docroot option, allowing a
remote attacker to mount a directory traversal attack and gain
unauthorized read access to sensitive files located outside of the web
root directory.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0.7-1+deb8u2. This update additionally includes the fix for
[CVE-2018-6758](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6758) which was aimed to be addressed in the upcoming jessie
point release.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14+20161117-3+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your uwsgi packages.
