More information:

Multiple security issues were found in PHP, a widely-used open source
general purpose scripting language: The EXIF module was susceptible to
denial of service/information disclosure when parsing malformed images,
the Apache module allowed cross-site-scripting via the body of a
"Transfer-Encoding: chunked" request and the IMAP extension performed
insufficient input validation which can result in the execution of
arbitrary shell commands in the imap\_open() function and denial of
service in the imap\_mail() function.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.33-0+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php7.0 packages.
