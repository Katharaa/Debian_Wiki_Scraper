More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in openafs, an implementation of
the distributed filesystem AFS. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2018-16947](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16947)
Jeffrey Altman reported that the backup tape controller (butc)
 process does accept incoming RPCs but does not require (or allow
 for) authentication of those RPCs, allowing an unauthenticated
 attacker to perform volume operations with administrator
 credentials.

* [CVE-2018-16948](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16948)
Mark Vitale reported that several RPC server routines do not fully
 initialize output variables, leaking memory contents (from both
 the stack and the heap) to the remote caller for
 otherwise-successful RPCs.

* [CVE-2018-16949](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16949)
Mark Vitale reported that an unauthenticated attacker can consume
 large amounts of server memory and network bandwidth via
 specially crafted requests, resulting in denial of service to
 legitimate clients.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.20-2+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.
