More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Ghostscript, the GPL
PostScript/PDF interpreter, which may result in denial of service or the
execution of arbitrary code if a malformed Postscript file is processed
(despite the -dSAFER sandbox being enabled).


This update rebases ghostscript for stretch to the upstream version 9.26
which includes additional changes.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.26~dfsg-0+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.
