Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-1000180](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000180).  

More information:

It was discovered that the low-level interface to the RSA key pair
generator of Bouncy Castle (a Java implementation of cryptographic
algorithms) could perform less Miller-Rabin primality tests than
expected.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.56-1+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your bouncycastle packages.
