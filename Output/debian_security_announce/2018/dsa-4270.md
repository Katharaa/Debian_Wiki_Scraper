In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-14424](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14424).  

More information:

Chris Coulson discovered a use-after-free flaw in the GNOME Display
Manager, triggerable by an unprivileged user via a specially crafted
sequence of D-Bus method calls, leading to denial of service or
potentially the execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.22.3-3+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your gdm3 packages.
