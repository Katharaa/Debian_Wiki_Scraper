-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
14 Aug 2018
Affected Packages:

[linux](https://packages.debian.org/src:linux)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-5391](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5391).  

More information:

* [CVE-2018-5391](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5391) (FragmentSmack)
 Juha-Matti Tilli discovered a flaw in the way the Linux kernel
 handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote
 attacker can take advantage of this flaw to trigger time and
 calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending
 specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.


This is mitigated by reducing the default limits on memory usage
 for incomplete fragmented packets. The same mitigation can be
 achieved without the need to reboot, by setting the sysctls:


`net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh = 196608  

 net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh = 196608  

 net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 262144  

 net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh = 262144`
The default values may still be increased by local configuration
 if necessary.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.9.110-3+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
