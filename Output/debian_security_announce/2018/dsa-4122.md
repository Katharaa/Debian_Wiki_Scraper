More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid3, a fully featured
web proxy cache. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2018-1000024](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000024)
Louis Dion-Marcil discovered that Squid does not properly handle
 processing of certain ESI responses. A remote server delivering
 certain ESI response syntax can take advantage of this flaw to cause
 a denial of service for all clients accessing the Squid service.
 This problem is limited to the Squid custom ESI parser.
