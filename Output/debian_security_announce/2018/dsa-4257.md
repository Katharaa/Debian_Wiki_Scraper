DSA-4257-1 fuse -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
28 Jul 2018
Affected Packages:

[fuse](https://packages.debian.org/src:fuse)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 904439](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=904439).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-10906](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10906).  

More information:

Jann Horn discovered that FUSE, a Filesystem in USErspace, allows the
bypass of the user\_allow\_other restriction when SELinux is active
(including in permissive mode). A local user can take advantage of this
flaw in the fusermount utility to bypass the system configuration and
mount a FUSE filesystem with the allow\_other mount option.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.7-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your fuse packages.
