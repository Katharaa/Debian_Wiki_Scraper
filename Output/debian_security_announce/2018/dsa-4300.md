It was discovered that Archive::Zip, a perl module for manipulation of
ZIP archives, is prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. An
attacker able to provide a specially crafted archive for processing can
take advantage of this flaw to overwrite arbitrary files during archive
extraction.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.59-1+deb9u1.
