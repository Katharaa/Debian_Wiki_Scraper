Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-5378](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5378), [CVE-2018-5379](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5379), [CVE-2018-5380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5380), [CVE-2018-5381](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5381).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Quagga, a routing
daemon. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following issues:


* [CVE-2018-5378](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5378)
It was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, does not
 properly bounds check data sent with a NOTIFY to a peer, if an
 attribute length is invalid. A configured BGP peer can take
 advantage of this bug to read memory from the bgpd process or cause
 a denial of service (daemon crash).

* [CVE-2018-5379](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5379)
It was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, can double-free
 memory when processing certain forms of UPDATE message, containing
 cluster-list and/or unknown attributes, resulting in a denial of
 service (bgpd daemon crash).


https://www.quagga.net/security/Quagga-2018-1114.txt
* [CVE-2018-5380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5380)
It was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, does not
 properly handle internal BGP code-to-string conversion tables.


https://www.quagga.net/security/Quagga-2018-1550.txt
* [CVE-2018-5381](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5381)
It was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, can enter an
 infinite loop if sent an invalid OPEN message by a configured peer.
 A configured peer can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial
 of service (bgpd daemon not responding to any other events; BGP
 sessions will drop and not be reestablished; unresponsive CLI
 interface).
