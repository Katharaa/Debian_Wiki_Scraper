More information:

CÃ©dric Buissart from Red Hat discovered an information disclosure bug in pcs, a
pacemaker command line interface and GUI. The REST interface normally doesn't
allow passing --debug parameter to prevent information leak, but the check
wasn't sufficient.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.155+dfsg-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your pcs packages.
