DSA-4093-1 openocd -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
21 Jan 2018
Affected Packages:

[openocd](https://packages.debian.org/src:openocd)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 887488](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=887488).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-5704](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5704).  

More information:

Josef Gajdusek discovered that OpenOCD, a JTAG debugger for ARM and MIPS,
was vulnerable to Cross Protocol Scripting attacks. An attacker could
craft a HTML page that, when visited by a victim running OpenOCD, could
execute arbitrary commands on the victims host.


This fix also sets the OpenOCD default binding to localhost, instead of
every network interfaces. This can be changed with the added bindto
command argument.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.8.0-4+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.0-1+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openocd packages.
