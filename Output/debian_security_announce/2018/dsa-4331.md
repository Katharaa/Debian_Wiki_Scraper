DSA-4331-1 curl -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
02 Nov 2018
Affected Packages:

[curl](https://packages.debian.org/src:curl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-16839](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16839), [CVE-2018-16842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16842).  

More information:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library.


* [CVE-2018-16839](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16839)
Harry Sintonen discovered that, on systems with a 32 bit size\_t, an
 integer overflow would be triggered when a SASL user name longer
 than 2GB is used. This would in turn cause a very small buffer to be
 allocated instead of the intended very huge one, which would trigger
 a heap buffer overflow when the buffer is used.
* [CVE-2018-16842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16842)
Brian Carpenter discovered that the logic in the curl tool to wrap
 error messages at 80 columns is flawed, leading to a read buffer
 overflow if a single word in the message is itself longer than 80
 bytes.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.52.1-5+deb9u8.


We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
