More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Ghostscript, the GPL
PostScript/PDF interpreter, which may result in denial of service,
disclosure of existence and size of arbitrary files, or the execution of
arbitrary code if a malformed Postscript file is processed (despite the
dSAFER sandbox being enabled).


This update rebases ghostscript for stretch to the upstream version 9.25
which includes additional non-security related changes.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.25~dfsg-0+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.
