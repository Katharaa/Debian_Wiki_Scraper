Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 895184](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=895184).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-9846](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-9846).  

More information:

Andrea Basile discovered that the archive plugin in roundcube, a
skinnable AJAX based webmail solution for IMAP servers, does not
properly sanitize a user-controlled parameter, allowing a remote
attacker to inject arbitrary IMAP commands and perform malicious
actions.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3+dfsg.1-4+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your roundcube packages.
