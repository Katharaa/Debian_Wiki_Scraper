More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in jruby, a Java
implementation of the Ruby programming language. They would allow an
attacker to use specially crafted gem files to mount cross-site
scripting attacks, cause denial of service through an infinite loop,
write arbitrary files, or run malicious code.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.26-1+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your jruby packages.


In addition, this message serves as an announcement that security
support for jruby in the Debian 8 oldstable release (jessie) is now
discontinued.


Users of jruby in Debian 8 that want security updates are strongly
encouraged to upgrade now to the current Debian 9 stable release
(stretch).
