------------------------------------



Date Reported:
17 Oct 2018
Affected Packages:

[libssh](https://packages.debian.org/src:libssh)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 911149](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=911149).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-10933](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10933).  

More information:

Peter Winter-Smith of NCC Group discovered that libssh, a tiny C SSH
library, contains an authentication bypass vulnerability in the server
code. An attacker can take advantage of this flaw to successfully
authenticate without any credentials by presenting the server an
SSH2\_MSG\_USERAUTH\_SUCCESS message in place of the
SSH2\_MSG\_USERAUTH\_REQUEST message which the server would expect to
initiate authentication.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.3-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libssh packages.
