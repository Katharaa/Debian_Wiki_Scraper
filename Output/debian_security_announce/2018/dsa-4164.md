Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-15710](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15710), [CVE-2017-15715](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15715), [CVE-2018-1283](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1283), [CVE-2018-1301](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1301), [CVE-2018-1303](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1303), [CVE-2018-1312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1312).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.


* [CVE-2017-15710](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15710)
Alex Nichols and Jakob Hirsch reported that mod\_authnz\_ldap, if
 configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, could cause an out of bound write
 if supplied with a crafted Accept-Language header. This could
 potentially be used for a Denial of Service attack.
* [CVE-2017-15715](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15715)
Elar Lang discovered that expression specified in <FilesMatch> could
 match '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename, rather
 than matching only the end of the filename. This could be exploited
 in environments where uploads of some files are externally
 blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.
* [CVE-2018-1283](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1283)
When mod\_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI
 applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user could
 influence their content by using a Session header.
* [CVE-2018-1301](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1301)
Robert Swiecki reported that a specially crafted request could have
 crashed the Apache HTTP Server, due to an out of bound access after
 a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header.
* [CVE-2018-1303](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1303)
Robert Swiecki reported that a specially crafted HTTP request header
 could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server if using
 mod\_cache\_socache, due to an out of bound read while preparing data
 to be cached in shared memory.
* [CVE-2018-1312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1312)
Nicolas Daniels discovered that when generating an HTTP Digest
 authentication challenge, the nonce sent by mod\_auth\_digest to
 prevent replay attacks was not correctly generated using a
 pseudo-random seed. In a cluster of servers using a common Digest
 authentication configuration, HTTP requests could be replayed across
 servers by an attacker without detection.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.4.10-10+deb8u12.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.25-3+deb9u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
