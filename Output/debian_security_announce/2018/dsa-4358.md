More information:

The Shopify Application Security Team discovered that ruby-sanitize, a
whitelist-based HTML sanitizer, is prone to a HTML injection
vulnerability. A specially crafted HTML fragment can cause to allow nonwhitelisted attributes to be used on a whitelisted HTML element.


For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-2+deb9u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-sanitize packages.
