----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
14 Jun 2018
Affected Packages:

[strongswan](https://packages.debian.org/src:strongswan)

Vulnerable:

Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2018-5388](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5388), [CVE-2018-10811](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10811).  

More information:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec suite.


* [CVE-2018-5388](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5388)
The stroke plugin did not verify the message length when reading from its
 control socket. This vulnerability could lead to denial of service. On
 Debian write access to the socket requires root permission on default
 configuration.
* [CVE-2018-10811](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10811)
A missing variable initialization in IKEv2 key derivation could lead to a
 denial of service (crash of the charon IKE daemon) if the openssl plugin is
 used in FIPS mode and the negotiated PRF is HMAC-MD5.


For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.2.1-6+deb8u6.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.1-4+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.
