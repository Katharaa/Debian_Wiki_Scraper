Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2017-5715](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5715), [CVE-2017-5754](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5754), [CVE-2017-13166](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-13166), [CVE-2018-5750](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5750).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may
lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks.


* [CVE-2017-5715](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5715)
Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
 processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
 controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
 addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes running on
 the system.


This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch target
 injection) and is mitigated in the Linux kernel for the Intel x86-64
 architecture by using the retpoline compiler feature which allows
 indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.
* [CVE-2017-5754](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5754)
Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in Intel
 processors, enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to
 read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from the kernel and all
 other processes running on the system.


This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in the
 Linux kernel on the powerpc/ppc64el architectures by flushing the L1
 data cache on exit from kernel mode to user mode (or from hypervisor to
 kernel).


This works on Power7, Power8 and Power9 processors.
* [CVE-2017-13166](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-13166)
A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2 IOCTL handling code
 has been found. Memory protections ensuring user-provided buffers always
 point to userland memory were disabled, allowing destination address to
 be in kernel space. This bug could be exploited by an attacker to
 overwrite kernel memory from an unprivileged userland process, leading
 to privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2018-5750](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5750)
An information leak has been found in the Linux kernel. The
 acpi\_smbus\_hc\_add() prints a kernel address in the kernel log at every
 boot, which could be used by an attacker on the system to defeat kernel
 ASLR.


Additionnaly to those vulnerability, some mitigations for [CVE-2017-5753](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5753) are
included in this release.


* [CVE-2017-5753](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5753)
Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
 processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
 controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
 addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes running on
 the system.


This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1 (bounds-check
 bypass) and is mitigated in the Linux kernel architecture by identifying
 vulnerable code sections (array bounds checking followed by array
 access) and replacing the array access with the speculation-safe
 array\_index\_nospec() function.


More use sites will be added over time.


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.82-1+deb9u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
