More information:

Tavis Ormandy discovered multiple vulnerabilites in Ghostscript, an
interpreter for the PostScript language, which could result in the
execution of arbitrary code if a malformed Postscript file is processed
(despite the dSAFER sandbox being enabled).


For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.20~dfsg-3.2+deb9u5.


We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.
