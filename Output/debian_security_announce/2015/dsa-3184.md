Affected Packages:

[gnupg](https://packages.debian.org/src:gnupg)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 778652](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=778652).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3591](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3591), [CVE-2015-0837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0837), [CVE-2015-1606](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1606).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in GnuPG, the GNU Privacy Guard:


* [CVE-2014-3591](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3591)
The Elgamal decryption routine was susceptible to a side-channel
 attack discovered by researchers of Tel Aviv University. Ciphertext
 blinding was enabled to counteract it. Note that this may have a
 quite noticeable impact on Elgamal decryption performance.
* [CVE-2015-0837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0837)
The modular exponentiation routine mpi\_powm() was susceptible to a
 side-channel attack caused by data-dependent timing variations when
 accessing its internal pre-computed table.
* [CVE-2015-1606](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1606)
The keyring parsing code did not properly reject certain packet
 types not belonging in a keyring, which caused an access to memory
 already freed. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (crash) via crafted keyring files.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.12-7+deb7u7.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 1.4.18-7.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.18-7.


We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.
