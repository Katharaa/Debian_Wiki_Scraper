Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 781547](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=781547), [Bug 784657](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=784657).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-7441](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7441), [CVE-2015-0847](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0847).  

More information:

Tuomas RÃ¤sÃ¤nen discovered that unsafe signal handling in nbd-server, the
server for the Network Block Device protocol, could allow remote
attackers to cause a deadlock in the server process and thus a denial of
service.


Tuomas RÃ¤sÃ¤nen also discovered that the modern-style negotiation was
carried out in the main server process before forking the actual client
handler. This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service
(crash) by querying a non-existent export. This issue only affected the
oldstable distribution (wheezy).


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:3.2-4~deb7u5.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:3.8-4+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:3.10-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:3.10-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your nbd packages.
