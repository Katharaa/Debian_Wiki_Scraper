Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-6885](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6885), [CVE-2014-8133](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8133), [CVE-2014-9419](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9419), [CVE-2014-9529](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9529), [CVE-2014-9584](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9584).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or information leaks.


* [CVE-2013-6885](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6885)
It was discovered that under specific circumstances, a combination
 of write operations to write-combined memory and locked CPU
 instructions may cause a core hang on AMD 16h 00h through 0Fh
 processors. A local user can use this flaw to mount a denial of
 service (system hang) via a crafted application.


For more information please refer to the AMD CPU erratum 793 in
 <http://support.amd.com/TechDocs/51810_16h_00h-0Fh_Rev_Guide.pdf>
* [CVE-2014-8133](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8133)
It was found that the espfix funcionality can be bypassed by
 installing a 16-bit RW data segment into GDT instead of LDT (which
 espfix checks for) and using it for stack. A local unprivileged user
 could potentially use this flaw to leak kernel stack addresses and
 thus allowing to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.
* [CVE-2014-9419](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9419)
It was found that on Linux kernels compiled with the 32 bit
 interfaces (CONFIG\_X86\_32) a malicious user program can do a
 partial ASLR bypass through TLS base addresses leak when attacking
 other programs.
* [CVE-2014-9529](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9529)
It was discovered that the Linux kernel is affected by a race
 condition flaw when doing key garbage collection, allowing local
 users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic).
* [CVE-2014-9584](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9584)
It was found that the Linux kernel does not validate a length value
 in the Extensions Reference (ER) System Use Field, which allows
 local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a
 crafted iso9660 image.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.65-1+deb7u1. Additionally this update fixes a suspend/resume
regression introduced with 3.2.65.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
