More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in arj, an open source
version of the arj archiver. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2015-0556](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0556)
Jakub Wilk discovered that arj follows symlinks created during
 unpacking of an arj archive. A remote attacker could use this flaw
 to perform a directory traversal attack if a user or automated
 system were tricked into processing a specially crafted arj archive.
* [CVE-2015-0557](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0557)
Jakub Wilk discovered that arj does not sufficiently protect from
 directory traversal while unpacking an arj archive containing file
 paths with multiple leading slashes. A remote attacker could use
 this flaw to write to arbitrary files if a user or automated system
 were tricked into processing a specially crafted arj archive.
* [CVE-2015-2782](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2782)
Jakub Wilk and Guillem Jover discovered a buffer overflow
 vulnerability in arj. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause
 an application crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
 privileges of the user running arj.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.10.22-10+deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 3.10.22-13.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.10.22-13.


We recommend that you upgrade your arj packages.
