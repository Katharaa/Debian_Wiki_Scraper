More information:

Two vulnerabilities have been found in unzip, a de-archiver for .zip
files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


* [CVE-2015-7696](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7696)
Gustavo Grieco discovered that unzip incorrectly handled certain
 password protected archives. If a user or automated system were
 tricked into processing a specially crafted zip archive, an attacker
 could possibly execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2015-7697](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7697)
Gustavo Grieco discovered that unzip incorrectly handled certain
 malformed archives. If a user or automated system were tricked into
 processing a specially crafted zip archive, an attacker could
 possibly cause unzip to hang, resulting in a denial of service.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 6.0-8+deb7u4.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
