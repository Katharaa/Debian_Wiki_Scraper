Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3290-1 linux -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Jun 2015
Affected Packages:

[linux](https://packages.debian.org/src:linux)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-1805](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1805), [CVE-2015-3636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3636), [CVE-2015-4167](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4167).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, information leaks
or data corruption.


* [CVE-2015-1805](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1805)
Red Hat discovered that the pipe iovec read and write
 implementations may iterate over the iovec twice but will modify the
 iovec such that the second iteration accesses the wrong memory. A
 local user could use this flaw to crash the system or possibly for
 privilege escalation. This may also result in data corruption and
 information leaks in pipes between non-malicious processes.
* [CVE-2015-3636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3636)
Wen Xu and wushi of KeenTeam discovered that users allowed to create
 ping sockets can use them to crash the system and, on 32-bit
 architectures, for privilege escalation. However, by default, no
 users on a Debian system have access to ping sockets.
* [CVE-2015-4167](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4167)
Carl Henrik Lunde discovered that the UDF implementation is missing
 a necessary length checks. A local user that can mount devices could
 use this flaw to crash the system.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems were fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1 or earlier, except for [CVE-2015-4167](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4167) which will
be fixed later.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
