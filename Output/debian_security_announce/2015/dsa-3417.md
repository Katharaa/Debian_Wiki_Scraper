Tibor Jager, JÃ¶rg Schwenk, and Juraj Somorovsky, from Horst GÃ¶rtz
Institute for IT Security, published a paper in ESORICS 2015 where they
describe an invalid curve attack in Bouncy Castle Crypto, a Java library
for cryptography. An attacker is able to recover private Elliptic Curve
keys from different applications, for example, TLS servers.
