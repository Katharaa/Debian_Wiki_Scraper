DSA-3159-1 ruby1.8 -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Feb 2015
Affected Packages:

[ruby1.8](https://packages.debian.org/src:ruby1.8)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-8080](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8080), [CVE-2014-8090](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8090).  

More information:

It was discovered that the REXML parser, part of the interpreter for the
Ruby language, could be coerced into allocating large string objects that
could consume all available memory on the system. This could allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash).


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in version
1.8.7.358-7.1+deb7u2.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.5-1 of the ruby2.1 source package.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
2.1.5-1 of the ruby2.1 source package.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.8 packages.
