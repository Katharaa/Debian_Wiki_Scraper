Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 783451](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=783451).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3406](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3406), [CVE-2015-3407](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3407), [CVE-2015-3408](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3408), [CVE-2015-3409](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3409).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libmodule-signature-perl, a
Perl module to manipulate CPAN SIGNATURE files. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2015-3406](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3406)
John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature could parse the
 unsigned portion of the SIGNATURE file as the signed portion due to
 incorrect handling of PGP signature boundaries.
* [CVE-2015-3407](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3407)
John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handles
 files that are not listed in the SIGNATURE file. This includes some
 files in the t/ directory that would execute when tests are run.
* [CVE-2015-3408](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3408)
John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature uses two argument
 open() calls to read the files when generating checksums from the
 signed manifest. This allows to embed arbitrary shell commands into
 the SIGNATURE file that would execute during the signature
 verification process.
* [CVE-2015-3409](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3409)
John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handles
 module loading, allowing to load modules from relative paths in
 @INC. A remote attacker providing a malicious module could use this
 issue to execute arbitrary code during signature verification.


Note that libtest-signature-perl received an update for compatibility
with the fix for [CVE-2015-3407](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3407)
in libmodule-signature-perl.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.68-1+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.73-1+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.78-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.78-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libmodule-signature-perl packages.
