More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, information leaks or privilege
escalation.


* [CVE-2013-7421](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7421) /
 [CVE-2014-9644](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9644)
It was discovered that the Crypto API allowed unprivileged users
 to load arbitrary kernel modules. A local user can use this flaw
 to exploit vulnerabilities in modules that would not normally be
 loaded.
* [CVE-2014-7822](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7822)
Akira Fujita found that the splice() system call did not validate
 the given file offset and length. A local unprivileged user can use
 this flaw to cause filesystem corruption on ext4 filesystems, or
 possibly other effects.
* [CVE-2014-8160](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8160)
Florian Westphal discovered that a netfilter (iptables/ip6tables) rule
 accepting packets to a specific SCTP, DCCP, GRE or UDPlite
 port/endpoint could result in incorrect connection tracking state.
 If only the generic connection tracking module (nf\_conntrack) was
 loaded, and not the protocol-specific connection tracking module,
 this would allow access to any port/endpoint of the specified
 protocol.
* [CVE-2014-8559](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8559)
It was found that kernel functions that iterate over a directory
 tree can dead-lock or live-lock in case some of the directory
 entries were recently deleted or dropped from the cache. A local
 unprivileged user can use this flaw for denial of service.
* [CVE-2014-9585](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9585)
Andy Lutomirski discovered that address randomisation for the vDSO
 in 64-bit processes is extremely biased. A local unprivileged user
 could potentially use this flaw to bypass the ASLR protection
 mechanism.
* [CVE-2014-9683](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9683)
Dmitry Chernenkov discovered that eCryptfs writes past the end of
 the allocated buffer during encrypted filename decoding, resulting
 in local denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-0239](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0239)
It was found that KVM did not correctly emulate the x86 SYSENTER
 instruction. An unprivileged user within a guest system that has
 not enabled SYSENTER, for example because the emulated CPU vendor
 is AMD, could potentially use this flaw to cause a denial of
 service or privilege escalation in that guest.
* [CVE-2015-1420](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1420)
It was discovered that the open\_by\_handle\_at() system call reads
 the handle size from user memory a second time after validating
 it. A local user with the CAP\_DAC\_READ\_SEARCH capability could use
 this flaw for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2015-1421](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1421)
It was found that the SCTP implementation could free an
 authentication state while it was still in use, resulting in heap
 corruption. This could allow remote users to cause a denial of
 service or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2015-1593](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1593)
It was found that address randomisation for the initial stack in
 64-bit processes was limited to 20 rather than 22 bits of entropy.
 A local unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to
 bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.65-1+deb7u2. Additionally this update fixes regressions
introduced in versions 3.2.65-1 and 3.2.65-1+deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon (a subset is fixed already).


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon
(a subset is fixed already).


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
