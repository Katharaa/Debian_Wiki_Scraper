More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the libpng PNG library.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


* [CVE-2015-7981](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7981)
Qixue Xiao discovered an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the
 png\_convert\_to\_rfc1123 function. A remote attacker can potentially
 take advantage of this flaw to cause disclosure of information from
 process memory.
* [CVE-2015-8126](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8126)
Multiple buffer overflows were discovered in the png\_set\_PLTE and
 png\_get\_PLTE functions. A remote attacker can take advantage of this
 flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a small
 bit-depth value in an IHDR (image header) chunk in a PNG image.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.49-1+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.
