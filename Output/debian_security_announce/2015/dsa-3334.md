DSA-3334-1 gnutls28 -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
12 Aug 2015
Affected Packages:

[gnutls28](https://packages.debian.org/src:gnutls28)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 795068](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=795068).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-6251](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6251).  

More information:

Kurt Roeckx discovered that decoding a specific certificate with very
long DistinguishedName (DN) entries leads to double free. A remote
attacker can take advantage of this flaw by creating a specially crafted
certificate that, when processed by an application compiled against
GnuTLS, could cause the application to crash resulting in a denial of
service.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.8-6+deb8u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.17-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages.
