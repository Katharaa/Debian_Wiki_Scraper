Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3268-1 ntfs-3g -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
22 May 2015
Affected Packages:

[ntfs-3g](https://packages.debian.org/src:ntfs-3g)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 786475](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=786475).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3202](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3202).  

More information:

Tavis Ormandy discovered that NTFS-3G, a read-write NTFS driver for
FUSE, does not scrub the environment before executing mount or umount
with elevated privileges. A local user can take advantage of this flaw
to overwrite arbitrary files and gain elevated privileges by accessing
debugging features via the environment that would not normally be safe
for unprivileged users.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2012.1.15AR.5-2.1+deb7u1. Note that this issue does not affect
the binary packages distributed in Debian in wheezy as ntfs-3g does not
use the embedded fuse-lite library.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2014.2.15AR.2-1+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your ntfs-3g packages.
