========================


DSA-3407-1 dpkg -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
26 Nov 2015
Affected Packages:

[dpkg](https://packages.debian.org/src:dpkg)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-0860](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0860).  

More information:

Hanno Boeck discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the dpkg-deb
component of dpkg, the Debian package management system. This flaw could
potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if a user or an automated
system were tricked into processing a specially crafted Debian binary
package (.deb) in the old style Debian binary package format.


This update also includes updated translations and additional bug fixes.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.16.17.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.17.26.


We recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.
