More information:

William Robinet and Michal Zalewski discovered multiple vulnerabilities
in the TIFF library and its tools, which may result in denial of
service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed TIFF file
is processed.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.2-6+deb7u4.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
before the initial release.


We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.
