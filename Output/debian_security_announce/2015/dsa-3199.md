========================


DSA-3199-1 xerces-c -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
20 Mar 2015
Affected Packages:

[xerces-c](https://packages.debian.org/src:xerces-c)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 780827](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=780827).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-0252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0252).  

More information:

Anton Rager and Jonathan Brossard from the Salesforce.com Product
Security Team and Ben Laurie of Google discovered a denial of service
vulnerability in xerces-c, a validating XML parser library for C++. The
parser mishandles certain kinds of malformed input documents, resulting
in a segmentation fault during a parse operation. An unauthenticated
attacker could use this flaw to cause an application using the
xerces-c library to crash.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.1-3+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your xerces-c packages.
