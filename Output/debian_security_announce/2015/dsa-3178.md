DSA-3178-1 unace -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
02 Mar 2015
Affected Packages:

[unace](https://packages.debian.org/src:unace)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 775003](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=775003).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-2063](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2063).  

More information:

Jakub Wilk discovered that unace, an utility to extract, test and view
.ace archives, contained an integer overflow leading to a buffer
overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a
specially crafted ace archive, an attacker could cause a denial of
service (application crash) or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2b-10+deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.2b-12.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2b-12.


We recommend that you upgrade your unace packages.
