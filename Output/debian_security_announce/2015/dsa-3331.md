----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Aug 2015
Affected Packages:

[subversion](https://packages.debian.org/src:subversion)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3184](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3184), [CVE-2015-3187](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3187).  

More information:

Several security issues have been found in the server components of the
version control system subversion.


* [CVE-2015-3184](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3184)
Subversion's mod\_authz\_svn does not properly restrict anonymous
 access in some mixed anonymous/authenticated environments when
 using Apache httpd 2.4. The result is that anonymous access may
 be possible to files for which only authenticated access should
 be possible. This issue does not affect the oldstable distribution
 (wheezy) because it only contains Apache httpd 2.2.
* [CVE-2015-3187](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3187)
Subversion servers, both httpd and svnserve, will reveal some
 paths that should be hidden by path-based authz. When a node is
 copied from an unreadable location to a readable location the
 unreadable path may be revealed. This vulnerablity only reveals
 the path, it does not reveal the contents of the path.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.6.17dfsg-4+deb7u10.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.10-6+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed in
version 1.9.0-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.
