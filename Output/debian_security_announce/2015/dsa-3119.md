--------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[libevent](https://packages.debian.org/src:libevent)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 774645](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=774645).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-6272](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-6272), [CVE-2015-6525](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6525).  

More information:

Andrew Bartlett of Catalyst reported a defect affecting certain
applications using the Libevent evbuffer API. This defect leaves
applications which pass insanely large inputs to evbuffers open to a
possible heap overflow or infinite loop. In order to exploit this flaw,
an attacker needs to be able to find a way to provoke the program into
trying to make a buffer chunk larger than what will fit into a single
size\_t or off\_t.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.19-stable-3+deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your libevent packages.
