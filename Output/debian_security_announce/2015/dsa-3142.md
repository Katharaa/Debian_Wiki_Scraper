========================


DSA-3142-1 eglibc -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
27 Jan 2015
Affected Packages:

[eglibc](https://packages.debian.org/src:eglibc)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-6656](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6656), [CVE-2014-6040](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-6040), [CVE-2014-7817](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7817), [CVE-2015-0235](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0235).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been fixed in eglibc, Debian's version of
the GNU C library:


* [CVE-2015-0235](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0235)
Qualys discovered that the gethostbyname and gethostbyname2
 functions were subject to a buffer overflow if provided with a
 crafted IP address argument. This could be used by an attacker to
 execute arbitrary code in processes which called the affected
 functions.


The original glibc bug was reported by Peter Klotz.
* [CVE-2014-7817](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7817)
Tim Waugh of Red Hat discovered that the WRDE\_NOCMD option of the
 wordexp function did not suppress command execution in all cases.
 This allows a context-dependent attacker to execute shell
 commands.
* [CVE-2012-6656](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6656)
[CVE-2014-6040](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-6040)
The charset conversion code for certain IBM multi-byte code pages
 could perform an out-of-bounds array access, causing the process
 to crash. In some scenarios, this allows a remote attacker to
 cause a persistent denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.13-38+deb7u7.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), the
[CVE-2015-0235](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0235)
issue has been fixed in version 2.18-1 of the glibc package.


We recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.
