Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3233-1 wpa -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 Apr 2015
Affected Packages:

[wpa](https://packages.debian.org/src:wpa)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 783148](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=783148).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-1863](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1863).  

More information:

The Google security team and the smart hardware research group of
Alibaba security team discovered a flaw in how wpa\_supplicant used SSID
information when creating or updating P2P peer entries. A remote
attacker can use this flaw to cause wpa\_supplicant to crash, expose
memory contents, and potentially execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0-3+deb7u2. Note that this issue does not affect the binary
packages distributed in Debian as the CONFIG\_P2P is not enabled for
the build.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 2.3-1+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.
