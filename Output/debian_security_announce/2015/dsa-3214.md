Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3214-1 mailman -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
06 Apr 2015
Affected Packages:

[mailman](https://packages.debian.org/src:mailman)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 781626](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=781626).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-2775](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2775).  

More information:

A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in Mailman, the mailing
list manager. Installations using a transport script (such as
postfix-to-mailman.py) to interface with their MTA instead of static
aliases were vulnerable to a path traversal attack. To successfully
exploit this, an attacker needs write access on the local file system.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.1.15-1+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.1.18-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your mailman packages.
