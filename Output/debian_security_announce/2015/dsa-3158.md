More information:

Michal Zalewski and Hanno Boeck discovered several vulnerabilities in
unrtf, a RTF to other formats converter, leading to a denial of service
(application crash) or, potentially, the execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.21.5-3~deb7u1. This update is based on a new upstream version
of unrtf including additional bug fixes, new features and incompatible
changes (especially PostScript support is dropped).


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.21.5-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your unrtf packages.
