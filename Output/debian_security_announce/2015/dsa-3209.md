More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in OpenLDAP, a free implementation
of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.


* [CVE-2013-4449](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4449)
Michael Vishchers from Seven Principles AG discovered a denial of
 service vulnerability in slapd, the directory server implementation.
 When the server is configured to used the RWM overlay, an attacker
 can make it crash by unbinding just after connecting, because of an
 issue with reference counting.
* [CVE-2014-9713](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9713)
The default Debian configuration of the directory database allows
 every users to edit their own attributes. When LDAP directories are
 used for access control, and this is done using user attributes, an
 authenticated user can leverage this to gain access to unauthorized
 resources.
 


Please note this is a Debian specific vulnerability.


The new package won't use the unsafe access control rule for new
 databases, but existing configurations won't be automatically
 modified. Administrators are incited to look at the README.Debian
 file provided by the updated package if they need to fix the access
 control rule.
* [CVE-2015-1545](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1545)
Ryan Tandy discovered a denial of service vulnerability in slapd.
 When using the deref overlay, providing an empty attribute list in
 a query makes the daemon crashes.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.31-2.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.4.40-4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.40-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your openldap packages.
