DSA-3296-1 libcrypto++ -- security update
-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
29 Jun 2015
Affected Packages:

[libcrypto++](https://packages.debian.org/src:libcrypto++)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-2141](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2141).  

More information:

Evgeny Sidorov discovered that libcrypto++, a general purpose C++
cryptographic library, did not properly implement blinding to mask
private key operations for the Rabin-Williams digital signature
algorithm. This could allow remote attackers to mount a timing attack
and retrieve the user's private key.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.6.1-6+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.1-6+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem will be fixed
in version 5.6.1-7.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.1-7.


We recommend that you upgrade your libcrypto++ packages.
