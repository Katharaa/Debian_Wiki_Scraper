DSA-3270-1 postgresql-9.4 -- security update
--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
22 May 2015
Affected Packages:

[postgresql-9.4](https://packages.debian.org/src:postgresql-9.4)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3165](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3165), [CVE-2015-3166](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3166), [CVE-2015-3167](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3167).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been found in PostgreSQL-9.4, a SQL
database system.


* [CVE-2015-3165](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3165)
(Remote crash)


SSL clients disconnecting just before the authentication timeout
 expires can cause the server to crash.
* [CVE-2015-3166](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3166)
(Information exposure)


The replacement implementation of snprintf() failed to check for
 errors reported by the underlying system library calls; the main
 case that might be missed is out-of-memory situations. In the worst
 case this might lead to information exposure.
* [CVE-2015-3167](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3167)
(Possible side-channel key exposure)


In contrib/pgcrypto, some cases of decryption with an incorrect key
 could report other error message texts. Fix by using a
 one-size-fits-all message.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.4.2-0+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed
soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.4.2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.4 packages.
