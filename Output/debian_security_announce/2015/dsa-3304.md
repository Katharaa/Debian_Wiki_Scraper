DSA-3304-1 bind9 -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Jul 2015
Affected Packages:

[bind9](https://packages.debian.org/src:bind9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-4620](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4620).  

More information:

Breno Silveira Soares of Servico Federal de Processamento de Dados
(SERPRO) discovered that the BIND DNS server is prone to a denial of
service vulnerability. A remote attacker who can cause a validating
resolver to query a zone containing specifically constructed contents
can cause the resolver to terminate with an assertion failure, resulting
in a denial of service to clients relying on the resolver.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u5.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
