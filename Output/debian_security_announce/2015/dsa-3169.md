More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been fixed in eglibc, Debian's version of
the GNU C library:


* [CVE-2012-3406](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3406)
The vfprintf function in stdio-common/vfprintf.c in GNU C Library (aka
 glibc) 2.5, 2.12, and probably other versions does not properly restrict
 the use of the alloca function when allocating the SPECS array, which
 allows context-dependent attackers to bypass the FORTIFY\_SOURCE
 format-string protection mechanism and cause a denial of service (crash)
 or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted format string using
 positional parameters and a large number of format specifiers, a different
 vulnerability than
 [CVE-2012-3404](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3404) and
 [CVE-2012-3405](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3405).
* [CVE-2013-7424](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7424)
An invalid free flaw was found in glibc's getaddrinfo() function when used
 with the AI\_IDN flag. A remote attacker able to make an application call
 this function could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the
 permissions of the user running the application. Note that this flaw only
 affected applications using glibc compiled with libidn support.
* [CVE-2014-4043](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4043)
The posix\_spawn\_file\_actions\_addopen function in glibc before 2.20 does not
 copy its path argument in accordance with the POSIX specification, which
 allows context-dependent attackers to trigger use-after-free
 vulnerabilities.
* [CVE-2014-9402](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9402)
The getnetbyname function in glibc 2.21 or earlier will enter an infinite
 loop if the DNS backend is activated in the system Name Service Switch
 configuration, and the DNS resolver receives a positive answer while
 processing the network name.
* [CVE-2015-1472](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1472) /
 [CVE-2015-1473](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1473)
Under certain conditions wscanf can allocate too little memory for the
 to-be-scanned arguments and overflow the allocated buffer. The incorrect
 use of "\_\_libc\_use\_alloca (newsize)" caused a different (and weaker)
 policy to be enforced which could allow a denial of service attack.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these issues are fixed in version
2.13-38+deb7u8 of the eglibc package.


For the unstable distribution (sid), all the above issues are fixed in version
2.19-15 of the glibc package.


We recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.
