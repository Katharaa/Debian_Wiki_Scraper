Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 787547](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=787547), [Bug 788460](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=788460).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3209](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3209), [CVE-2015-4037](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4037), [CVE-2015-4103](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4103), [CVE-2015-4104](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4104), [CVE-2015-4105](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4105), [CVE-2015-4106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4106).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor
emulator.


* [CVE-2015-3209](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3209)
Matt Tait of Google's Project Zero security team discovered a flaw
 in the way QEMU's AMD PCnet Ethernet emulation handles multi-TMD
 packets with a length above 4096 bytes. A privileged guest user in a
 guest with an AMD PCNet ethernet card enabled can potentially use
 this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges
 of the hosting QEMU process.
* [CVE-2015-4037](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4037)
Kurt Seifried of Red Hat Product Security discovered that QEMU's
 user mode networking stack uses predictable temporary file names
 when the -smb option is used. An unprivileged user can use this flaw
 to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-4103](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4103)
Jan Beulich of SUSE discovered that the QEMU Xen code does not
 properly restrict write access to the host MSI message data field,
 allowing a malicious guest to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-4104](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4104)
Jan Beulich of SUSE discovered that the QEMU Xen code does not
 properly restrict access to PCI MSI mask bits, allowing a malicious
 guest to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-4105](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4105)
Jan Beulich of SUSE reported that the QEMU Xen code enables
 logging for PCI MSI-X pass-through error messages, allowing a
 malicious guest to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-4106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4106)
Jan Beulich of SUSE discovered that the QEMU Xen code does not
 properly restrict write access to the PCI config space for certain
 PCI pass-through devices, allowing a malicious guest to cause a
 denial of service, obtain sensitive information or potentially
 execute arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u8. Only [CVE-2015-3209](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3209) and [CVE-2015-4037](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4037)
affect oldstable.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.3+dfsg-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.
