More information:

John Stumpo discovered that OpenAFS, a distributed file system, does
not fully initialize certain network packets before transmitting them.
This can lead to a disclosure of the plaintext of previously processed
packets.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.6.1-3+deb7u5.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.9-2+deb8u4.


For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.6.15-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.
