Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-4975](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4975), [CVE-2014-8080](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8080), [CVE-2014-8090](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8090).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the interpreter for the Ruby
language:


* [CVE-2014-4975](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4975)
The encodes() function in pack.c had an off-by-one error that could
 lead to a stack-based buffer overflow. This could allow remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or arbitrary code
 execution.
* [CVE-2014-8080](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8080),
 [CVE-2014-8090](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8090)
The REXML parser could be coerced into allocating large string
 objects that could consume all available memory on the system. This
 could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash).


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.3.194-8.1+deb7u3.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.1.5-1 of the ruby2.1 source package.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.5-1 of the ruby2.1 source package.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.9.1 packages.
