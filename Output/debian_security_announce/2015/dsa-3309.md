Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3309-1 tidy -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Jul 2015
Affected Packages:

[tidy](https://packages.debian.org/src:tidy)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 792571](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=792571).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-5522](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5522), [CVE-2015-5523](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5523).  

More information:

Fernando MuÃ±oz discovered that invalid HTML input passed to tidy, an
HTML syntax checker and reformatter, could trigger a buffer overflow.
This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
or potentially execute arbitrary code.


Geoff McLane also discovered that a similar issue could trigger an
integer overflow, leading to a memory allocation of 4GB. This could
allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service by saturating the
target's memory.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 20091223cvs-1.2+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 20091223cvs-1.4+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your tidy packages.
