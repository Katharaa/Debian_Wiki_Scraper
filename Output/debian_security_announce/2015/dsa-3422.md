More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
integer overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation errors
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, bypass of the same-origin
policy or denial of service.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 38.5.0esr-1~deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 38.5.0esr-1~deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
