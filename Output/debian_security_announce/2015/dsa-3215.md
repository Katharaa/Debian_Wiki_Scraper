More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libgd2, a graphics library:


* [CVE-2014-2497](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2497)
The gdImageCreateFromXpm() function would try to dereference a NULL
 pointer when reading an XPM file with a special color table. This
 could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via
 crafted XPM files.
* [CVE-2014-9709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9709)
Importing an invalid GIF file using the gdImageCreateFromGif() function
 would cause a read buffer overflow that could allow remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted GIF files.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.36~rc1~dfsg-6.1+deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.1.0-5.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.0-5.


We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.
