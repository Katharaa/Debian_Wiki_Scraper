Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3217-1 dpkg -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
09 Apr 2015
Affected Packages:

[dpkg](https://packages.debian.org/src:dpkg)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-0840](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0840).  

More information:

Jann Horn discovered that the source package integrity verification in
dpkg-source can be bypassed via a specially crafted Debian source
control file (.dsc). Note that this flaw only affects extraction of
local Debian source packages via dpkg-source but not the installation of
packages from the Debian archive.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.16.16. This update also includes non-security changes
previously scheduled for the next wheezy point release. See the Debian
changelog for details.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.17.25.


We recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.
