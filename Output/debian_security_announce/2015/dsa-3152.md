Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3152-1 unzip -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
03 Feb 2015
Affected Packages:

[unzip](https://packages.debian.org/src:unzip)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 776589](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=776589).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-9636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9636).  

More information:

A flaw was found in the test\_compr\_eb() function allowing out-of-bounds
read and write access to memory locations. By carefully crafting a
corrupt ZIP archive an attacker can trigger a heap overflow, resulting
in application crash or possibly having other unspecified impact.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.0-8+deb7u2. Additionally this update corrects a defective
patch applied to address [CVE-2014-8139](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8139), which caused a regression with
executable jar files.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.0-15. The defective patch applied to address [CVE-2014-8139](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8139) was
corrected in version 6.0-16.


We recommend that you upgrade your unzip packages.
