----------------------------------



Date Reported:
22 Apr 2015
Affected Packages:

[curl](https://packages.debian.org/src:curl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3143](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3143), [CVE-2015-3144](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3144), [CVE-2015-3145](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3145), [CVE-2015-3148](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3148).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library:


* [CVE-2015-3143](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3143)
NTLM-authenticated connections could be wrongly reused for requests
 without any credentials set, leading to HTTP requests being sent
 over the connection authenticated as a different user. This is
 similar to the issue fixed in DSA-2849-1.
* [CVE-2015-3144](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3144)
When parsing URLs with a zero-length hostname (such as "http://:80"),
 libcurl would try to read from an invalid memory address. This could
 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash). This
 issue only affects the upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid)
 distributions.
* [CVE-2015-3145](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3145)
When parsing HTTP cookies, if the parsed cookie's path element
 consists of a single double-quote, libcurl would try to write to an
 invalid heap memory address. This could allow remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (crash). This issue only affects the
 upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions.
* [CVE-2015-3148](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3148)
When doing HTTP requests using the Negotiate authentication method
 along with NTLM, the connection used would not be marked as
 authenticated, making it possible to reuse it and send requests for
 one user over the connection authenticated as a different user.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy13.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 7.38.0-4+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.42.0-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
