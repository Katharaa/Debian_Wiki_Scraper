------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[jasper](https://packages.debian.org/src:jasper)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 775970](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=775970).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-8157](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8157), [CVE-2014-8158](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8158).  

More information:

An off-by-one flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
([CVE-2014-8157](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8157)), and an unrestricted stack memory use flaw
([CVE-2014-8158](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8158)) were found in JasPer, a library for manipulating
JPEG-2000 files. A specially crafted file could cause an application
using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.900.1-13+deb7u3.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.
