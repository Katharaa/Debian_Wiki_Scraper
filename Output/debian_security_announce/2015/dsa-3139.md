========================


DSA-3139-1 squid -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
25 Jan 2015
Affected Packages:

[squid](https://packages.debian.org/src:squid)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 776194](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=776194).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3609](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3609).  

More information:

Matthew Daley discovered that squid, a web proxy cache, does not
properly perform input validation when parsing requests. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to mount a denial of service attack, by
sending specially crafted Range requests.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.STABLE9-4.1+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your squid packages.
