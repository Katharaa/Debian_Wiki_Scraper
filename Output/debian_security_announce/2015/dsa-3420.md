Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3420-1 bind9 -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
15 Dec 2015
Affected Packages:

[bind9](https://packages.debian.org/src:bind9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 808081](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=808081).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-8000](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8000).  

More information:

It was discovered that the BIND DNS server does not properly handle the
parsing of incoming responses, allowing some records with an incorrect
class to be accepted by BIND instead of being rejected as malformed.
This can trigger a REQUIRE assertion failure when those records are
subsequently cached. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service against servers performing recursive queries.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u8.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
