DSA-3191-1 gnutls26 -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
15 Mar 2015
Affected Packages:

[gnutls26](https://packages.debian.org/src:gnutls26)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-0282](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0282), [CVE-2015-0294](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0294).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GnuTLS, a library
implementing the TLS and SSL protocols. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2015-0282](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0282)
GnuTLS does not verify the RSA PKCS #1 signature algorithm to match
 the signature algorithm in the certificate, leading to a potential
 downgrade to a disallowed algorithm without detecting it.
* [CVE-2015-0294](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0294)
It was reported that GnuTLS does not check whether the two signature
 algorithms match on certificate import.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.12.20-8+deb7u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.
