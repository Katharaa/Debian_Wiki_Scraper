Jean-Max Reymond and Ucha Gobejishvili discovered a use-after-free
 vulnerability which occurs when resizing of a canvas element is
 triggered in concert with style changes. A web page containing
 malicious content can cause Iceweasel to crash, or potentially,
 execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
 Iceweasel.

Bas Venis reported a flaw in the handling of add-ons installation. A
 remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to bypass the add-on
 installation prompt and trick a user into installing an add-on from
 a malicious source.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 38.2.1esr-1~deb7u1.
