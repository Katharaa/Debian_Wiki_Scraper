More information:

It was discovered that FreeType did not properly handle some malformed
inputs. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) via crafted font files.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.4.9-1.1+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.2-3+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.6-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your freetype packages.
