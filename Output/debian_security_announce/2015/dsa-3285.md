Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 788460](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=788460).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3209](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3209), [CVE-2015-4037](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4037).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware.


* [CVE-2015-3209](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3209)
Matt Tait of Google's Project Zero security team discovered a flaw
 in the way QEMU's AMD PCnet Ethernet emulation handles multi-TMD
 packets with a length above 4096 bytes. A privileged guest user in a
 guest with an AMD PCNet ethernet card enabled can potentially use
 this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges
 of the hosting QEMU process.
* [CVE-2015-4037](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4037)
Kurt Seifried of Red Hat Product Security discovered that QEMU's
 user mode networking stack uses predictable temporary file names
 when the -smb option is used. An unprivileged user can use this flaw
 to cause a denial of service.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u8.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
