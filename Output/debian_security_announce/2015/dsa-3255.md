Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 784366](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=784366).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-9721](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9721).  

More information:

It was discovered that libzmq, a lightweight messaging kernel, is
susceptible to a protocol downgrade attack on sockets using the ZMTP v3
protocol. This could allow remote attackers to bypass ZMTP v3 security
mechanisms by sending ZMTP v2 or earlier headers.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.5+dfsg-2+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.5+dfsg-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.5+dfsg-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your zeromq3 packages.
