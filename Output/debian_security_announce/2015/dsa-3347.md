========================


DSA-3347-1 pdns -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
02 Sep 2015
Affected Packages:

[pdns](https://packages.debian.org/src:pdns)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-5230](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5230).  

More information:

Pyry Hakulinen and Ashish Shakla at Automattic discovered that pdns,
an authoritative DNS server, was incorrectly processing some DNS
packets; this would enable a remote attacker to trigger a DoS by
sending specially crafted packets causing the server to crash. 


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.1-4+deb8u3.


For the testing distribution (stretch) and unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 3.4.6-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.
