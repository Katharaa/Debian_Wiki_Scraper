Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3220-1 libtasn1-3 -- security update
----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
11 Apr 2015
Affected Packages:

[libtasn1-3](https://packages.debian.org/src:libtasn1-3)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-2806](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2806).  

More information:

Hanno Boeck discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the
asn1\_der\_decoding function in Libtasn1, a library to manage ASN.1
structures. A remote attacker could take advantage of this flaw to cause
an application using the Libtasn1 library to crash, or potentially to
execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.13-2+deb7u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-3 packages.
