Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-7446](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7446), [CVE-2015-7799](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7799), [CVE-2015-7833](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7833), [CVE-2015-8104](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8104), [CVE-2015-8374](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8374), [CVE-2015-8543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8543).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, information leak
or data loss.


* [CVE-2013-7446](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7446)
Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a particular sequence of valid
 operations on local (AF\_UNIX) sockets can result in a
 use-after-free. This may be used to cause a denial of service
 (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2015-7799](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7799)
It was discovered that a user granted access to /dev/ppp can cause a
 denial of service (crash) by passing invalid parameters to the
 PPPIOCSMAXCID ioctl. This also applies to ISDN PPP device nodes.
* [CVE-2015-7833](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7833)
Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke and Ralf Spenneberg discovered a
 flaw in the processing of certain USB device descriptors in the
 usbvision driver. An attacker with physical access to the system can
 use this flaw to crash the system. This was partly fixed by the
 changes listed in DSA 3396-1.
* [CVE-2015-8104](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8104)
Jan Beulich reported a guest to host denial-of-service flaw
 affecting the KVM hypervisor running on AMD processors. A malicious
 guest can trigger an infinite stream of debug (#DB) exceptions
 causing the processor microcode to enter an infinite loop where the
 core never receives another interrupt. This leads to a panic of the
 host kernel.
* [CVE-2015-8374](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8374)
It was discovered that Btrfs did not correctly implement truncation
 of compressed inline extents. This could lead to an information
 leak, if a file is truncated and later made readable by other users.
 Additionally, it could cause data loss. This has been fixed for the
 stable distribution (jessie) only.
* [CVE-2015-8543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8543)
It was discovered that a local user permitted to create raw sockets
 could cause a denial-of-service by specifying an invalid protocol
 number for the socket. The attacker must have the CAP\_NET\_RAW
 capability in their user namespace. This has been fixed for the
 stable distribution (jessie) only.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.73-2+deb7u1. In addition, this update contains several
changes originally targeted for the upcoming Wheezy point release.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u1. In addition, this update contains several
changes originally targeted for the upcoming Jessie point release.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
