Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3321-1 xmltooling -- security update
----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 Jul 2015
Affected Packages:

[xmltooling](https://packages.debian.org/src:xmltooling)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 793855](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=793855).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-0851](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0851).  

More information:

The InCommon Shibboleth Training team discovered that XMLTooling, a
C++ XML parsing library, did not properly handle an exception when
parsing well-formed but schema-invalid XML. This could allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted XML data.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.4.2-5+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.3-2+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed shortly.


We recommend that you upgrade your xmltooling packages.
