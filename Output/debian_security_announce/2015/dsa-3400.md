Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3400-1 lxc -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
19 Nov 2015
Affected Packages:

[lxc](https://packages.debian.org/src:lxc)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 800471](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=800471).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-1335](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1335).  

More information:

Roman Fiedler discovered a directory traversal flaw in LXC, the Linux
Containers userspace tools. A local attacker with access to a LXC
container could exploit this flaw to run programs inside the container
that are not confined by AppArmor or expose unintended files in the host
to the container.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.0.6-6+deb8u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your lxc packages.
