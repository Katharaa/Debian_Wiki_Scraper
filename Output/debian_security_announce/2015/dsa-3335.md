More information:

It was discovered that Request Tracker, an extensible trouble-ticket
tracking system is susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack via the
user and group rights management pages ([CVE-2015-5475](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5475)) and via the
cryptography interface, allowing an attacker with a carefully-crafted
key to inject JavaScript into RT's user interface. Installations which
use neither GnuPG nor S/MIME are unaffected by the second cross-site
scripting vulnerability.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.7-5+deb7u4. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is only
affected by [CVE-2015-5475](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5475).


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.8-3+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.11-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker4 packages.
