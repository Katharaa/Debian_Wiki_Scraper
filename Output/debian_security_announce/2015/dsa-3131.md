More information:

John Houwer discovered a way to cause xdg-open, a tool that automatically
opens URLs in a user's preferred application, to execute arbitrary
commands remotely.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.0~rc1+git20111210-6+deb7u2.


For the upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions,

We recommend that you upgrade your xdg-utils packages.
