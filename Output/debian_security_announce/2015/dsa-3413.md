-------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[openssl](https://packages.debian.org/src:openssl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3194](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3194), [CVE-2015-3195](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3195), [CVE-2015-3196](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3196).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure
Sockets Layer toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2015-3194](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3194)
Loic Jonas Etienne of Qnective AG discovered that the signature
 verification routines will crash with a NULL pointer dereference if
 presented with an ASN.1 signature using the RSA PSS algorithm and
 absent mask generation function parameter. A remote attacker can
 exploit this flaw to crash any certificate verification operation
 and mount a denial of service attack.
* [CVE-2015-3195](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3195)
Adam Langley of Google/BoringSSL discovered that OpenSSL will leak
 memory when presented with a malformed X509\_ATTRIBUTE structure.
* [CVE-2015-3196](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3196)
A race condition flaw in the handling of PSK identify hints was
 discovered, potentially leading to a double free of the identify
 hint data.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u18.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1k-3+deb8u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2e-1 or earlier.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
