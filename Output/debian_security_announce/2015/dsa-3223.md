Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3223-1 ntp -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
12 Apr 2015
Affected Packages:

[ntp](https://packages.debian.org/src:ntp)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 782095](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=782095).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-1798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1798), [CVE-2015-1799](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1799), [CVE-2015-3405](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3405).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in ntp, an implementation of the
Network Time Protocol:


* [CVE-2015-1798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1798)
When configured to use a symmetric key with an NTP peer, ntpd would
 accept packets without MAC as if they had a valid MAC. This could
 allow a remote attacker to bypass the packet authentication and send
 malicious packets without having to know the symmetric key.
* [CVE-2015-1799](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1799)
When peering with other NTP hosts using authenticated symmetric
 association, ntpd would update its internal state variables before
 the MAC of the NTP messages was validated. This could allow a remote
 attacker to cause a denial of service by impeding synchronization
 between NTP peers.


Additionally, it was discovered that generating MD5 keys using ntp-keygen
on big endian machines would either trigger an endless loop, or generate
non-random keys.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-2+deb7u4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-7.


We recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.
