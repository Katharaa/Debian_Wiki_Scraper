More information:

Fabian Yamaguchi discovered multiple vulnerabilities in VLC, a multimedia
player and streamer:


* [CVE-2014-9626](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9626)
The MP4 demuxer, when parsing string boxes, did not properly check
 the length of the box, leading to a possible integer underflow when
 using this length value in a call to memcpy(). This could allow
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or arbitrary
 code execution via crafted MP4 files.
* [CVE-2014-9627](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9627)
The MP4 demuxer, when parsing string boxes, did not properly check
 that the conversion of the box length from 64bit integer to 32bit
 integer on 32bit platforms did not cause a truncation, leading to
 a possible buffer overflow. This could allow remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (crash) or arbitrary code execution via
 crafted MP4 files.
* [CVE-2014-9628](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9628)
The MP4 demuxer, when parsing string boxes, did not properly check
 the length of the box, leading to a possible buffer overflow. This
 could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
 or arbitrary code execution via crafted MP4 files.
* [CVE-2014-9629](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9629)
The Dirac and Schroedinger encoders did not properly check for an
 integer overflow on 32bit platforms, leading to a possible buffer
 overflow. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (crash) or arbitrary code execution.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.3-5+deb7u2.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.2.0~rc2-2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.0~rc2-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.
