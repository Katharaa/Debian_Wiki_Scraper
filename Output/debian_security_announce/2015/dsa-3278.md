----------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
03 Jun 2015
Affected Packages:

[libapache-mod-jk](https://packages.debian.org/src:libapache-mod-jk)

Vulnerable:

Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 783233](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=783233).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-8111](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8111).  

More information:

An information disclosure flaw due to incorrect JkMount/JkUnmount
directives processing was found in the Apache 2 module mod\_jk to forward
requests from the Apache web server to Tomcat. A JkUnmount rule for a
subtree of a previous JkMount rule could be ignored. This could allow a
remote attacker to potentially access a private artifact in a tree that
would otherwise not be accessible to them.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:1.2.37-1+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.2.37-4+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:1.2.40+svn150520-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.2.40+svn150520-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-jk packages.
