DSA-3168-1 ruby-redcloth -- security update
-------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
22 Feb 2015
Affected Packages:

[ruby-redcloth](https://packages.debian.org/src:ruby-redcloth)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 774748](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=774748).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2012-6684](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6684).  

More information:

Kousuke Ebihara discovered that redcloth, a Ruby module used to
convert Textile markup to HTML, did not properly sanitize its
input. This allowed a remote attacker to perform a cross-site
scripting attack by injecting arbitrary JavaScript code into the
generated HTML.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.9-2+deb7u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.9-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-redcloth packages.
