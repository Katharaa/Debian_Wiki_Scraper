More information:

Adam discovered several problems in inspircd, an IRC daemon:


* An incomplete patch for [CVE-2012-1836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1836)
 failed to adequately resolve the problem where maliciously crafted DNS
 requests could lead to remote code execution through a heap-based buffer
 overflow.
* The incorrect processing of specific DNS packets could trigger an
 infinite loop, thus resulting in a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.5-1+deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.0.16-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your inspircd packages.
