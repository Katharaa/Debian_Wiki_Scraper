Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3137-1 websvn -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 Jan 2015
Affected Packages:

[websvn](https://packages.debian.org/src:websvn)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 775682](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=775682).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2013-6892](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6892).  

More information:

James Clawson discovered that websvn, a web viewer for Subversion
repositories, would follow symlinks in a repository when presenting a
file for download. An attacker with repository write access could
thereby access any file on disk readable by the user the webserver
runs as.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-1.1+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-1.2.


We recommend that you upgrade your websvn packages.
