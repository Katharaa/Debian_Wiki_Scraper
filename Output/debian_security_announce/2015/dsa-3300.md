More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
use-after-frees and other implementation errors may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code or denial of service. This update also
addresses a vulnerability in DHE key processing commonly known as
the LogJam vulnerability.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 31.8.0esr-1~deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 31.8.0esr-1~deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 38.1.0esr-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
