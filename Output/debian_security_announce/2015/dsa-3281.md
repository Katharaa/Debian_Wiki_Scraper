More information:

This is a notice that the Debian Security Team has changed its PGP/GPG
contact key because of a periodic regular key rollover.


The new key's fingerprint is:


`0D59 D2B1 5144 766A 14D2 41C6 6BAF 400B 05C3 E651`
The creation date is 2015-01-18 and it has been signed by the previous
Security Team contact key and several individual team members.


Please use the new key from now on for encrypted communication with the
Debian Security Team. You can obtain the new key from a keyserver, e.g.
[pgp.surfnet.nl](http://pgp.surfnet.nl/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651).


Our website has been updated to reflect this change.


Note that this concerns only the key used for communication with the
team. The keys used to sign the security.debian.org APT archive or
the keys used to sign the security advisories have not changed.
