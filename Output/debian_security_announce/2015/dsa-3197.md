More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure
Sockets Layer toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2015-0286](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0286)
Stephen Henson discovered that the ASN1\_TYPE\_cmp() function
 can be crashed, resulting in denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-0287](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0287)
Emilia Kaesper discovered a memory corruption in ASN.1 parsing.
* [CVE-2015-0289](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0289)
Michal Zalewski discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the
 PKCS#7 parsing code, resulting in denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-0292](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0292)
It was discovered that missing input sanitising in base64 decoding
 might result in memory corruption.
* [CVE-2015-0209](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0209)
It was discovered that a malformed EC private key might result in
 memory corruption.
* [CVE-2015-0288](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0288)
It was discovered that missing input sanitising in the
 X509\_to\_X509\_REQ() function might result in denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u15. In this update the export ciphers are removed
from the default cipher list.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
