Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3323-1 icu -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
01 Aug 2015
Affected Packages:

[icu](https://packages.debian.org/src:icu)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 778511](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=778511), [Bug 784773](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=784773).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-6585](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-6585), [CVE-2014-8146](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8146), [CVE-2014-8147](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8147), [CVE-2015-4760](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4760).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the International Components
for Unicode (ICU) library.


* [CVE-2014-8146](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8146)
The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation does not properly
 track directionally isolated pieces of text, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow)
 or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted text.
* [CVE-2014-8147](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8147)
The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation uses an integer
 data type that is inconsistent with a header file, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect malloc
 followed by invalid free) or possibly execute arbitrary code via
 crafted text.
* [CVE-2015-4760](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4760)
The Layout Engine was missing multiple boundary checks. These could
 lead to buffer overflows and memory corruption. A specially crafted
 file could cause an application using ICU to parse untrusted font
 files to crash and, possibly, execute arbitrary code.


Additionally, it was discovered that the patch applied to ICU in DSA-3187-1
for [CVE-2014-6585](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-6585) was incomplete, possibly leading to an invalid memory
access. This could allow remote attackers to disclose portion of private
memory via crafted font files.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.8.1.1-12+deb7u3.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.1-8+deb8u2.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 52.1-10.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.1-10.


We recommend that you upgrade your icu packages.
