More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor
emulator.


* [CVE-2015-3214](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3214)
Matt Tait of Google's Project Zero security team discovered a flaw
 in the QEMU i8254 PIT emulation. A privileged guest user in a guest
 with QEMU PIT emulation enabled could potentially use this flaw to
 execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the
 hosting QEMU process.
* [CVE-2015-5154](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5154)
Kevin Wolf of Red Hat discovered a heap buffer overflow flaw in the
 IDE subsystem in QEMU while processing certain ATAPI commands. A
 privileged guest user in a guest with the CDROM drive enabled could
 potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with
 the privileges of the hosting QEMU process.
* [CVE-2015-5165](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5165)
Donghai Zhu discovered that the QEMU model of the RTL8139 network
 card did not sufficiently validate inputs in the C+ mode offload
 emulation, allowing a malicious guest to read uninitialized memory
 from the QEMU process's heap.
* [CVE-2015-5225](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5225)
Mr Qinghao Tang from QIHU 360 Inc. and Mr Zuozhi from Alibaba Inc
 discovered a buffer overflow flaw in the VNC display driver leading
 to heap memory corruption. A privileged guest user could use this
 flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash), or
 potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the
 privileges of the hosting QEMU process.
* [CVE-2015-5745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5745)
A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the way QEMU
 handles the virtio-serial device. A malicious guest could use this
 flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u9. The oldstable distribution is only
affected by [CVE-2015-5165](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5165) and [CVE-2015-5745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5745).


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.4+dfsg-1a.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.
