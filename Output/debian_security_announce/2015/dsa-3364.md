Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 796036](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=796036).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-8215](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8215), [CVE-2015-2925](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2925), [CVE-2015-5156](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5156), [CVE-2015-6252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6252), [CVE-2015-6937](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6937), [CVE-2015-7312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7312).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.


* [CVE-2015-8215](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8215)
It was discovered that NetworkManager would set IPv6 MTUs based on
 the values received in IPv6 RAs (Router Advertisements), without
 sufficiently validating these values. A remote attacker could
 exploit this attack to disable IPv6 connectivity. This has been
 mitigated by adding validation in the kernel.
* [CVE-2015-2925](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2925)
Jann Horn discovered that when a subdirectory of a filesystem is
 bind-mounted into a container that has its own user and mount
 namespaces, a process with CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN capability in the user
 namespace can access files outside of the subdirectory. The
 default Debian configuration mitigated this as it does not allow
 unprivileged users to create new user namespaces.
* [CVE-2015-5156](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5156)
Jason Wang discovered that when a virtio\_net device is connected
 to a bridge in the same VM, a series of TCP packets forwarded
 through the bridge may cause a heap buffer overflow. A remote
 attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or
 possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2015-6252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6252)
Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat Engineering found that the vhost
 driver leaked file descriptors passed to it with the
 VHOST\_SET\_LOG\_FD ioctl command. A privileged local user with access
 to the /dev/vhost-net file, either directly or via libvirt, could
 use this to cause a denial of service (hang or crash).
* [CVE-2015-6937](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6937)
It was found that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol
 implementation did not verify that an underlying transport exists
 when creating a connection. Depending on how a local RDS
 application initialised its sockets, a remote attacker might be
 able to cause a denial of service (crash) by sending a crafted
 packet.
* [CVE-2015-7312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7312)
Xavier Chantry discovered that the patch provided by the aufs
 project to correct behaviour of memory-mapped files from an aufs
 mount introduced a race condition in the msync() system call.
 Ben Hutchings found that it also introduced a similar bug in the
 madvise\_remove() function. A local attacker could use this to
 cause a denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u4.
[CVE-2015-2925](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2925) and
[CVE-2015-7312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7312) do
not affect the wheezy distribution.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
