DSA-3319-1 bind9 -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
28 Jul 2015
Affected Packages:

[bind9](https://packages.debian.org/src:bind9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 793903](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=793903).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-5477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5477).  

More information:

Jonathan Foote discovered that the BIND DNS server does not properly
handle TKEY queries. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw
to mount a denial of service via a specially crafted query triggering an
assertion failure and causing BIND to exit.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u6.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
