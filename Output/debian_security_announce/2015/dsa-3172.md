More information:

Peter De Wachter discovered that CUPS, the Common UNIX Printing
System, did not correctly parse compressed raster files. By submitting
a specially crafted raster file, a remote attacker could use this
vulnerability to trigger a buffer overflow.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.3-5+deb7u5.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.7.5-11.


We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.
