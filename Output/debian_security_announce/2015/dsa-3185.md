-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
12 Mar 2015
Affected Packages:

[libgcrypt11](https://packages.debian.org/src:libgcrypt11)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3591](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3591), [CVE-2015-0837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0837).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libgcrypt:


* [CVE-2014-3591](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3591)
The Elgamal decryption routine was susceptible to a side-channel
 attack discovered by researchers of Tel Aviv University. Ciphertext
 blinding was enabled to counteract it. Note that this may have a
 quite noticeable impact on Elgamal decryption performance.
* [CVE-2015-0837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0837)
The modular exponentiation routine mpi\_powm() was susceptible to a
 side-channel attack caused by data-dependent timing variations when
 accessing its internal pre-computed table.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.0-5+deb7u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your libgcrypt11 packages.
