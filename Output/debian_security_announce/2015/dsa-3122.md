Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-8150](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8150).  

More information:

Andrey Labunets of Facebook discovered that cURL, an URL transfer
library, fails to properly handle URLs with embedded end-of-line
characters. An attacker able to make an application using libcurl to
access a specially crafted URL via an HTTP proxy could use this flaw to
do additional requests in a way that was not intended, or insert
additional request headers into the request.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy12.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be
fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.38.0-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
