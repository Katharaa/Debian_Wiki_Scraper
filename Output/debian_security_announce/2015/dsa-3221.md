Affected Packages:

[das-watchdog](https://packages.debian.org/src:das-watchdog)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 781806](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=781806).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-2831](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2831).  

More information:

Adam Sampson discovered a buffer overflow in the handling of the
XAUTHORITY environment variable in das-watchdog, a watchdog daemon to
ensure a realtime process won't hang the machine. A local user can
exploit this flaw to escalate his privileges and execute arbitrary
code as root.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.0-2+deb7u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.0-3.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your das-watchdog packages.
