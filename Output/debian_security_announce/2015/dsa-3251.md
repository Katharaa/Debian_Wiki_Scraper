Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3251-1 dnsmasq -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
05 May 2015
Affected Packages:

[dnsmasq](https://packages.debian.org/src:dnsmasq)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 783459](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=783459).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3294](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3294).  

More information:

Nick Sampanis discovered that dnsmasq, a small caching DNS proxy and
DHCP/TFTP server, did not properly check the return value of the
setup\_reply() function called during a TCP connection, which is used
then as a size argument in a function which writes data on the client's
connection. A remote attacker could exploit this issue via a specially
crafted DNS request to cause dnsmasq to crash, or potentially to obtain
sensitive information from process memory.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.62-3+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.72-3+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your dnsmasq packages.
