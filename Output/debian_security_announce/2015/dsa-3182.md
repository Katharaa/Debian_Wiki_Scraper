========================


DSA-3182-1 libssh2 -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
11 Mar 2015
Affected Packages:

[libssh2](https://packages.debian.org/src:libssh2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 780249](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=780249).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-1782](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1782).  

More information:

Mariusz Ziulek reported that libssh2, a SSH2 client-side library, was
reading and using the SSH\_MSG\_KEXINIT packet without doing sufficient
range checks when negotiating a new SSH session with a remote server. A
malicious attacker could man in the middle a real server and cause a
client using the libssh2 library to crash (denial of service) or
otherwise read and use unintended memory areas in this process.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.2-1.1+deb7u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libssh2 packages.
