More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Request Tracker, an
extensible trouble-ticket tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

Christian Loos discovered a remote denial of service vulnerability,
 exploitable via the email gateway and affecting any installation
 which accepts mail from untrusted sources. Depending on RT's

 reveal RSS feeds URLs, and thus ticket data.
* [CVE-2015-1464](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1464)
It was discovered that RSS feed URLs can be leveraged to perform
 session hijacking, allowing a user with the URL to log in as the
 user that created the feed.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.7-5+deb7u3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
