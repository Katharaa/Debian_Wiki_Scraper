Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3173-1 libgtk2-perl -- security update
------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
25 Feb 2015
Affected Packages:

[libgtk2-perl](https://packages.debian.org/src:libgtk2-perl)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
No other external database security references currently available.
More information:

It was discovered that libgtk2-perl, a Perl interface to the 2.x series
of the Gimp Toolkit library, incorrectly frees memory which GTK+ still
holds onto and might access later, leading to denial of service
(application crash) or, potentially, to arbitrary code execution.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.244-1+deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 2:1.2492-4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.2492-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your libgtk2-perl packages.
