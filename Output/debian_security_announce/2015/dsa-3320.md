More information:

It was discovered that OpenAFS, the implementation of the distributed
filesystem AFS, contained several flaws that could result in
information leak, denial-of-service or kernel panic.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.6.1-3+deb7u3.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.9-2+deb8u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.
