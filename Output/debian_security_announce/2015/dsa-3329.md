More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel
that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or
information leak.


* [CVE-2015-1333](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1333)
Colin Ian King discovered a flaw in the add\_key function of the
 Linux kernel's keyring subsystem. A local user can exploit this flaw
 to cause a denial of service due to memory exhaustion.
* [CVE-2015-3212](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3212)
Ji Jianwen of Red Hat Engineering discovered a flaw in the handling
 of the SCTPs automatic handling of dynamic multi-homed connections.
 A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a crash or potentially
 for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2015-4692](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4692)
A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the
 kvm\_apic\_has\_events function in the KVM subsystem. A unprivileged
 local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system kernel
 resulting in denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-4700](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4700)
Daniel Borkmann discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel implementation
 of the Berkeley Packet Filter which can be used by a local user to
 crash the system.
* [CVE-2015-5364](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5364)
It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
 invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to
 cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid
 checksums.
* [CVE-2015-5366](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5366)
It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
 invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of
 service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single
 packet with an invalid checksum.
* [CVE-2015-5697](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5697)
A flaw was discovered in the md driver in the Linux kernel leading
 to an information leak.
* [CVE-2015-5706](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5706)
An user triggerable use-after-free vulnerability in path lookup in
 the Linux kernel could potentially lead to privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2015-5707](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5707)
An integer overflow in the SCSI generic driver in the Linux kernel
 was discovered. A local user with write permission on a SCSI generic
 device could potentially exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u3. [CVE-2015-1333](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1333), [CVE-2015-4692](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4692) and
[CVE-2015-5706](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5706) do not affect the wheezy distribution.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u3, except [CVE-2015-5364](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5364) and [CVE-2015-5366](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5366)
which were fixed already in DSA-3313-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.3-1 or earlier versions.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
