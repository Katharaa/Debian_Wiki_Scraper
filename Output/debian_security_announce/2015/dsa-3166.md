More information:

Jose Duart of the Google Security Team discovered a buffer overflow
in e2fsprogs, a set of utilities for the ext2, ext3, and ext4 file
systems. This issue can possibly lead to arbitrary code execution if
a malicious device is plugged in, the system is configured to
automatically mount it, and the mounting process chooses to run fsck
on the device's malicious filesystem.


* [CVE-2015-0247](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0247)
Buffer overflow in the ext2/ext3/ext4 file system open/close
 routines.
* [CVE-2015-1572](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1572)
Incomplete fix for
 [CVE-2015-0247](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0247).


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.42.5-1.1+deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions,
these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your e2fsprogs packages.
