Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 797976](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=797976).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3247](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3247).  

More information:

Frediano Ziglio of Red Hat discovered a race condition flaw in spice's
worker\_update\_monitors\_config() function, leading to a heap-based memory
corruption. A malicious user in a guest can take advantage of this flaw
to cause a denial of service (QEMU process crash) or, potentially
execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the hosting
QEMU process.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5-1+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5-1.2.


We recommend that you upgrade your spice packages.
