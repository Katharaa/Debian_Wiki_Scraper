Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-8176](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8176), [CVE-2015-1788](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1788), [CVE-2015-1789](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1789), [CVE-2015-1790](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1790), [CVE-2015-1791](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1791), [CVE-2015-1792](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1792), [CVE-2015-4000](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4000).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Sockets
Layer toolkit.


* [CVE-2014-8176](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8176)
Praveen Kariyanahalli, Ivan Fratric and Felix Groebert discovered
 that an invalid memory free could be triggered when buffering DTLS
 data. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code. This issue only
 affected the oldstable distribution (wheezy).
* [CVE-2015-1788](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1788)
Joseph Barr-Pixton discovered that an infinite loop could be triggered
 due to incorrect handling of malformed ECParameters structures. This
 could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-1789](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1789)
Robert Swiecki and Hanno BÃ¶ck discovered that the X509\_cmp\_time
 function could read a few bytes out of bounds. This could allow remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted
 certificates and CRLs.
* [CVE-2015-1790](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1790)
Michal Zalewski discovered that the PKCS#7 parsing code did not
 properly handle missing content which could lead to a NULL pointer
 dereference. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (crash) via crafted ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs.
* [CVE-2015-1791](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1791)
Emilia KÃ¤sper discovered that a race condition could occur due to
 incorrect handling of NewSessionTicket in a multi-threaded client,
 leading to a double free. This could allow remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (crash).
* [CVE-2015-1792](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1792)
Johannes Bauer discovered that the CMS code could enter an infinite
 loop when verifying a signedData message, if presented with an
 unknown hash function OID. This could allow remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service.


Additionally OpenSSL will now reject handshakes using DH parameters
 shorter than 768 bits as a countermeasure against the Logjam attack
 ([CVE-2015-4000](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4000)).


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u17.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1k-3+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0.2b-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2b-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
