--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
01 Dec 2015
Affected Packages:

[gnutls26](https://packages.debian.org/src:gnutls26)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-8313](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8313).  

More information:

It was discovered that GnuTLS, a library implementing the TLS and SSL
protocols, incorrectly validates the first byte of padding in CBC modes.
A remote attacker can possibly take advantage of this flaw to perform a
padding oracle attack.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.12.20-8+deb7u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.
