Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-3569](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3569), [CVE-2014-3570](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3570), [CVE-2014-3571](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3571), [CVE-2014-3572](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3572), [CVE-2014-8275](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8275), [CVE-2015-0204](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0204), [CVE-2015-0205](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0205), [CVE-2015-0206](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0206).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure
Sockets Layer toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:


* [CVE-2014-3569](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3569)
Frank Schmirler reported that the ssl23\_get\_client\_hello function in
 OpenSSL does not properly handle attempts to use unsupported
 protocols. When OpenSSL is built with the no-ssl3 option and a SSL
 v3 ClientHello is received, the ssl method would be set to NULL which
 could later result in a NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash.
* [CVE-2014-3570](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3570)
Pieter Wuille of Blockstream reported that the bignum squaring
 (BN\_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some platforms, which
 might make it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic
 protection mechanisms.
* [CVE-2014-3571](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3571)
Markus Stenberg of Cisco Systems, Inc. reported that a carefully
 crafted DTLS message can cause a segmentation fault in OpenSSL due
 to a NULL pointer dereference. A remote attacker could use this flaw
 to mount a denial of service attack.
* [CVE-2014-3572](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3572)
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that an
 OpenSSL client would accept a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH
 ciphersuite if the server key exchange message is omitted. This
 allows remote SSL servers to conduct ECDHE-to-ECDH downgrade attacks
 and trigger a loss of forward secrecy.
* [CVE-2014-8275](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8275)
Antti Karjalainen and Tuomo Untinen of the Codenomicon CROSS project
 and Konrad Kraszewski of Google reported various certificate
 fingerprint issues, which allow remote attackers to defeat a
 fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist protection mechanism.
* [CVE-2015-0204](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0204)
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that
 an OpenSSL client will accept the use of an ephemeral RSA key in a
 non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite, violating the TLS
 standard. This allows remote SSL servers to downgrade the security
 of the session.
* [CVE-2015-0205](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0205)
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that an
 OpenSSL server will accept a DH certificate for client
 authentication without the certificate verify message. This flaw
 effectively allows a client to authenticate without the use of a
 private key via crafted TLS handshake protocol traffic to a server
 that recognizes a certification authority with DH support.
* [CVE-2015-0206](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0206)
Chris Mueller discovered a memory leak in the dtls1\_buffer\_record
 function. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to mount a
 denial of service through memory exhaustion by repeatedly sending
 specially crafted DTLS records.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u14.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be
fixed soon.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1k-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
