-------------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[python-django](https://packages.debian.org/src:python-django)

Vulnerable:

Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-5143](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5143), [CVE-2015-5144](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5144).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python
web development framework:


* [CVE-2015-5143](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5143)
Eric Peterson and Lin Hua Cheng discovered that a new empty record
 used to be created in the session storage every time a session was
 accessed and an unknown session key was provided in the request
 cookie. This could allow remote attackers to saturate the session
 store or cause other users' session records to be evicted.
* [CVE-2015-5144](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5144)
Sjoerd Job Postmus discovered that some built-in validators did not
 properly reject newlines in input values. This could allow remote
 attackers to inject headers in emails and HTTP responses.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.5-1+deb7u12.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.7-1+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
