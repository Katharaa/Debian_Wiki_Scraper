More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in the Xen virtualisation
solution:


* [CVE-2015-3209](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3209)
Matt Tait discovered a flaw in the way QEMU's AMD PCnet Ethernet
 emulation handles multi-TMD packets with a length above 4096 bytes.
 A privileged guest user in a guest with an AMD PCNet ethernet card
 enabled can potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on
 the host with the privileges of the hosting QEMU process.
* [CVE-2015-4103](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4103)
Jan Beulich discovered that the QEMU Xen code does not properly
 restrict write access to the host MSI message data field, allowing
 a malicious guest to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-4104](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4104)
Jan Beulich discovered that the QEMU Xen code does not properly
 restrict access to PCI MSI mask bits, allowing a malicious guest to
 cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-4105](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4105)
Jan Beulich reported that the QEMU Xen code enables logging for PCI
 MSI-X pass-through error messages, allowing a malicious guest to
 cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-4106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4106)
Jan Beulich discovered that the QEMU Xen code does not properly restrict
 write access to the PCI config space for certain PCI pass-through devices,
 allowing a malicious guest to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive
 information or potentially execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2015-4163](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4163)
Jan Beulich discovered that a missing version check in the
 GNTTABOP\_swap\_grant\_ref hypercall handler may result in denial of service.
 This only applies to Debian stable/jessie.
* [CVE-2015-4164](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4164)
Andrew Cooper discovered a vulnerability in the iret hypercall handler,
 which may result in denial of service.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.1.4-3+deb7u8. 


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.1-9+deb8u1. [CVE-2015-3209](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3209), [CVE-2015-4103](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4103), [CVE-2015-4104](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4104),
[CVE-2015-4105](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4105) and [CVE-2015-4106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4106) don't affect the Xen package in stable
jessie, it uses the standard qemu package and has already been fixed in
DSA-3284-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.
