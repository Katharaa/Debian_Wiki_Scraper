In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3290](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3290), [CVE-2015-3291](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3291), [CVE-2015-4167](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4167), [CVE-2015-5157](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5157), [CVE-2015-5364](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5364), [CVE-2015-5366](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5366).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.


* [CVE-2015-3290](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3290)
Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly
 handle nested NMIs. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw
 for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2015-3291](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3291)
Andy Lutomirski discovered that under certain conditions a malicious
 userspace program can cause the kernel to skip NMIs leading to a
 denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-4167](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4167)
Carl Henrik Lunde discovered that the UDF implementation is missing
 a necessary length check. A local user that can mount devices could
 use this flaw to crash the system.
* [CVE-2015-5157](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5157)
Petr Matousek and Andy Lutomirski discovered that an NMI that
 interrupts userspace and encounters an IRET fault is incorrectly
 handled. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw for denial
 of service or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2015-5364](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5364)
It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
 invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to
 cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid
 checksums.
* [CVE-2015-5366](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5366)
It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
 invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of
 service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single
 packet with an invalid checksum.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.8-2 or earlier versions.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
