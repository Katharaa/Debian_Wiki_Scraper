Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 793298](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=793298).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-1331](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1331), [CVE-2015-1334](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1334).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in LXC, the Linux
Containers userspace tools. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2015-1331](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1331)
Roman Fiedler discovered a directory traversal flaw in LXC when
 creating lock files. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to
 create an arbitrary file as the root user.
* [CVE-2015-1334](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1334)
Roman Fiedler discovered that LXC incorrectly trusted the
 container's proc filesystem to set up AppArmor profile changes and
 SELinux domain transitions. A malicious container could create a
 fake proc filesystem and use this flaw to run programs inside the
 container that are not confined by AppArmor or SELinux.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.0.6-6+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:1.0.7-4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.0.7-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your lxc packages.
