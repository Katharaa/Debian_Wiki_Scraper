========================


DSA-3205-1 batik -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
27 Mar 2015
Affected Packages:

[batik](https://packages.debian.org/src:batik)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 780897](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=780897).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-0250](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0250).  

More information:

Nicolas Gregoire and Kevin Schaller discovered that Batik, a toolkit
for processing SVG images, would load XML external entities by
default. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a
specially crafted SVG file, an attacker could possibly obtain access
to arbitrary files or cause resource consumption.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7+dfsg-3+deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.7+dfsg-5.


We recommend that you upgrade your batik packages.
