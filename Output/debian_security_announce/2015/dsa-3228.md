========================


DSA-3228-1 ppp -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
16 Apr 2015
Affected Packages:

[ppp](https://packages.debian.org/src:ppp)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 782450](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=782450).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3310](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3310).  

More information:

Emanuele Rocca discovered that ppp, a daemon implementing the
Point-to-Point Protocol, was subject to a buffer overflow when
communicating with a RADIUS server. This would allow unauthenticated
users to cause a denial-of-service by crashing the daemon.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.5-5.1+deb7u2.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.4.6-3.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ppp packages.
