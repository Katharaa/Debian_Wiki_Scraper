Security database references:

In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3026](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3026).  

More information:

Juliane Holzt discovered that Icecast2, a streaming media server, could
dereference a NULL pointer when URL authentication is configured and the
stream\_auth URL is trigged by a client without setting any credentials.
This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash).


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.0-1.1+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem will be fixed in
version 2.4.2-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your icecast2 packages.
