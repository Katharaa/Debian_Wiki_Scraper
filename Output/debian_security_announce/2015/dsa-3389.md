Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3389-1 elasticsearch -- end-of-life
---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
01 Nov 2015
Affected Packages:

[elasticsearch](https://packages.debian.org/src:elasticsearch)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
No other external database security references currently available.
More information:

Security support for elasticsearch in jessie is hereby discontinued. The
project no longer releases information on fixed security issues which
allow backporting them to released versions of Debian and actively
discourages from doing so.


elasticsearch will also be removed from Debian stretch (the next stable
Debian release), but will continue to remain in unstable.
