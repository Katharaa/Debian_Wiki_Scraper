Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3342-1 vlc -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
20 Aug 2015
Affected Packages:

[vlc](https://packages.debian.org/src:vlc)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-5949](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5949).  

More information:

Loren Maggiore of Trail of Bits discovered that the 3GP parser of VLC, a
multimedia player and streamer, could dereference an arbitrary pointer
due to insufficient restrictions on a writable buffer. This could allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted 3GP files.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.0~rc2-2+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed shortly.


We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.
