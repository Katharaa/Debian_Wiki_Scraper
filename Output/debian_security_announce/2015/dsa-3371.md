More information:

Frediano Ziglio of Red Hat discovered several vulnerabilities in spice,
a SPICE protocol client and server library. A malicious guest can
exploit these flaws to cause a denial of service (QEMU process crash),
execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the hosting
QEMU process or read and write arbitrary memory locations on the host.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.11.0-1+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.5-1+deb8u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.5-1.3.


We recommend that you upgrade your spice packages.
