========================


DSA-3405-1 smokeping -- security update
---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
25 Nov 2015
Affected Packages:

[smokeping](https://packages.debian.org/src:smokeping)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-0859](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0859).  

More information:

Tero Marttila discovered that the Debian packaging for smokeping
installed it in such a way that the CGI implementation of Apache httpd
(mod\_cgi) passed additional arguments to the smokeping\_cgi program,
potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in response to crafted
HTTP requests.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.6.8-2+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.9-1+deb8u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your smokeping packages.
