More information:

Jakub Wilk discovered that in requests, an HTTP library for the Python
language, authentication information was improperly handled when a
redirect occured. This would allow remote servers to obtain two
different types of sensitive information: proxy passwords from the
Proxy-Authorization header
([CVE-2014-1830](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1830)), or netrc passwords from the Authorization header
([CVE-2014-1829](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1829)).


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.1-1+deb7u1.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.3.0-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your requests packages.
