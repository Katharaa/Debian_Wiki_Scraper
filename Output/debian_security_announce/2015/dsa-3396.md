-----------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[linux](https://packages.debian.org/src:linux)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-5307](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5307), [CVE-2015-7833](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7833), [CVE-2015-7872](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7872), [CVE-2015-7990](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7990).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service.


* [CVE-2015-5307](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5307)
Ben Serebrin from Google discovered a guest to host denial of
 service flaw affecting the KVM hypervisor. A malicious guest can
 trigger an infinite stream of alignment check (#AC) exceptions
 causing the processor microcode to enter an infinite loop where the
 core never receives another interrupt. This leads to a panic of the
 host kernel.
* [CVE-2015-7833](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7833)
Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke and Ralf Spenneberg discovered a
 flaw in the processing of certain USB device descriptors in the
 usbvision driver. An attacker with physical access to the system can
 use this flaw to crash the system.
* [CVE-2015-7872](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7872)
Dmitry Vyukov discovered a vulnerability in the keyrings garbage
 collector allowing a local user to trigger a kernel panic.
* [CVE-2015-7990](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7990)
It was discovered that the fix for [CVE-2015-6937](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6937) was incomplete. A
 race condition when sending a message on unbound socket can still
 cause a NULL pointer dereference. A remote attacker might be able to
 cause a denial of service (crash) by sending a crafted packet.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u6.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u6.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
