More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware.


* [CVE-2015-5278](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5278)
Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered an infinite loop issue in
 the NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this
 flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).
* [CVE-2015-5279](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5279)
Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a heap buffer overflow flaw
 in the NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this
 flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash), or
 potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the
 privileges of the hosting QEMU process.
* [CVE-2015-6815](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6815)
Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered an infinite loop issue in
 the e1000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this flaw
 to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).
* [CVE-2015-6855](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6855)
Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a flaw in the IDE
 subsystem in QEMU occurring while executing IDE's
 WIN\_READ\_NATIVE\_MAX command to determine the maximum size of a
 drive. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to mount a
 denial of service (QEMU process crash).


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u11.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
