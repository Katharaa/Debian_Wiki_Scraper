DSA-3327-1 squid3 -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
03 Aug 2015
Affected Packages:

[squid3](https://packages.debian.org/src:squid3)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 793128](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=793128).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-5400](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5400).  

More information:

Alex Rousskov of The Measurement Factory discovered that Squid3, a fully
featured web proxy cache, does not correctly handle CONNECT method peer
responses when configured with cache\_peer and operating on explicit
proxy traffic. This could allow remote clients to gain unrestricted
access through a gateway proxy to its backend proxy.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.1.20-2.2+deb7u3.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.8-6+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.6-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.
