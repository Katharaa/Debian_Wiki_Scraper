More information:

A vulnerability was discovered in PolarSSL, a lightweight crypto and
SSL/TLS library. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw using
specially crafted certificates to mount a denial of service against an
application linked against the library (application crash), or
potentially, to execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.9-1~deb7u5.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.
