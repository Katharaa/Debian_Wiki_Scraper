More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client: multiple memory safety errors,
use-after-frees and other implementation errors may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code or denial of service. This update also
addresses a vulnerability in DHE key processing commonly known as
the LogJam vulnerability.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 31.8.0-1~deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.8.0-1~deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed
shortly.


We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
