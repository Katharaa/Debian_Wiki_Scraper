allowing local attackers to gain additional privileges.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.4.1-7+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8-3+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libvdpau packages.
