DSA-3165-1 xdg-utils -- security update
---------------------------------------



Date Reported:
21 Feb 2015
Affected Packages:

[xdg-utils](https://packages.debian.org/src:xdg-utils)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 777722](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=777722).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-1877](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1877).  

More information:

Jiri Horner discovered a way to cause xdg-open, a tool that automatically
opens URLs in a user's preferred application, to execute arbitrary
commands remotely.


This problem only affects /bin/sh implementations that don't sanitize
local variables. Dash, which is the default /bin/sh in Debian is
affected. Bash as /bin/sh is known to be unaffected.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.0~rc1+git20111210-6+deb7u3.


For the upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions,
this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your xdg-utils packages.
