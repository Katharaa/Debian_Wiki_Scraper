Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 780958](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=780958), [Bug 780989](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=780989).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-9706](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9706), [CVE-2015-0838](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0838).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Dulwich, a Python
implementation of the file formats and protocols used by the Git version
control system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2014-9706](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9706)
It was discovered that Dulwich allows writing to files under .git/
 when checking out working trees. This could lead to the execution of
 arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running an
 application based on Dulwich.
* [CVE-2015-0838](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0838)
Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team has found a buffer
 overflow in the C implementation of the apply\_delta() function,
 used when accessing Git objects in pack files. An attacker could
 take advantage of this flaw to cause the execution of arbitrary
 code with the privileges of the user running a Git server or client
 based on Dulwich.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.5-2+deb7u2.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 0.9.7-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.10.1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your dulwich packages.
