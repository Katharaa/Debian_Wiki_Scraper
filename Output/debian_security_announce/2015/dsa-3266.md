DSA-3266-1 fuse -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
21 May 2015
Affected Packages:

[fuse](https://packages.debian.org/src:fuse)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 786439](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=786439).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3202](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3202).  

More information:

Tavis Ormandy discovered that FUSE, a Filesystem in USErspace, does not
scrub the environment before executing mount or umount with elevated
privileges. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to overwrite
arbitrary files and gain elevated privileges by accessing debugging
features via the environment that would not normally be safe for
unprivileged users.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.9.0-2+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.3-15+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your fuse packages.
