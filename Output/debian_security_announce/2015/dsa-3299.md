DSA-3299-1 stunnel4 -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
02 Jul 2015
Affected Packages:

[stunnel4](https://packages.debian.org/src:stunnel4)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 785352](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=785352).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3644](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3644).  

More information:

Johan Olofsson discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in
Stunnel, a program designed to work as an universal SSL tunnel for
network daemons. When Stunnel in server mode is used with the redirect
option and certificate-based authentication is enabled with verify = 2
or higher, then only the initial connection is redirected to the hosts
specified with redirect. This allows a remote attacker to bypass
authentication.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3:5.06-2+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 3:5.18-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3:5.18-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your stunnel4 packages.
