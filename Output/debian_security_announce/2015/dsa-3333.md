More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
integer overflows, buffer overflows, use-after-frees and other
implementation errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code,
bypass of the same-origin policy or denial of service.


Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 31.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 38.x releases.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 38.2.0esr-1~deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 38.2.0esr-1~deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 38.2.0esr-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
