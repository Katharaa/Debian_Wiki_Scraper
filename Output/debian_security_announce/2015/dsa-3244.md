--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
02 May 2015
Affected Packages:

[owncloud](https://packages.debian.org/src:owncloud)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-3011](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3011), [CVE-2015-3012](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3012), [CVE-2015-3013](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3013).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in ownCloud, a cloud storage
web service for files, music, contacts, calendars and many more.


* [CVE-2015-3011](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3011)
Hugh Davenport discovered that the contacts application shipped
 with ownCloud is vulnerable to multiple stored cross-site
 scripting attacks. This vulnerability is effectively exploitable
 in any browser.
* [CVE-2015-3012](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3012)
Roy Jansen discovered that the documents application shipped with
 ownCloud is vulnerable to multiple stored cross-site scripting
 attacks. This vulnerability is not exploitable in browsers that
 support the current CSP standard.
* [CVE-2015-3013](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3013)
Lukas Reschke discovered a blacklist bypass vulnerability, allowing
 authenticated remote attackers to bypass the file blacklist and
 upload files such as the .htaccess files. An attacker could leverage
 this bypass by uploading a .htaccess and execute arbitrary PHP code
 if the /data/ directory is stored inside the web root and a web
 server that interprets .htaccess files is used. On default Debian
 installations the data directory is outside of the web root and thus
 this vulnerability is not exploitable by default.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.4+dfsg-4~deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.0.4+dfsg-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.4+dfsg-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your owncloud packages.
