More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2014-8159](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8159)
It was found that the Linux kernel's InfiniBand/RDMA subsystem did
 not properly sanitize input parameters while registering memory
 regions from user space via the (u)verbs API. A local user with
 access to a /dev/infiniband/uverbsX device could use this flaw to
 crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the
 system.
* [CVE-2014-9715](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9715)
It was found that the netfilter connection tracking subsystem used
 too small a type as an offset within each connection's data
 structure, following a bug fix in Linux 3.2.33 and 3.6. In some
 configurations, this would lead to memory corruption and crashes
 (even without malicious traffic). This could potentially also
 result in violation of the netfilter policy or remote code
 execution.


This can be mitigated by disabling connection tracking accounting:  

`sysctl net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct=0`
* [CVE-2015-2041](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2041)
Sasha Levin discovered that the LLC subsystem exposed some variables
 as sysctls with the wrong type. On a 64-bit kernel, this possibly
 allows privilege escalation from a process with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN
 capability; it also results in a trivial information leak.
* [CVE-2015-2042](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2042)
Sasha Levin discovered that the RDS subsystem exposed some variables
 as sysctls with the wrong type. On a 64-bit kernel, this results in
 a trivial information leak.
* [CVE-2015-2150](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2150)
Jan Beulich discovered that Xen guests are currently permitted to
 modify all of the (writable) bits in the PCI command register of
 devices passed through to them. This in particular allows them to
 disable memory and I/O decoding on the device unless the device is
 an SR-IOV virtual function, which can result in denial of service
 to the host.
* [CVE-2015-2830](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2830)
Andrew Lutomirski discovered that when a 64-bit task on an amd64
 kernel makes a fork(2) or clone(2) system call using int $0x80, the
 32-bit compatibility flag is set (correctly) but is not cleared on
 return. As a result, both seccomp and audit will misinterpret the
 following system call by the task(s), possibly leading to a
 violation of security policy.
* [CVE-2015-2922](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2922)
Modio AB discovered that the IPv6 subsystem would process a router
 advertisement that specifies no route but only a hop limit, which
 would then be applied to the interface that received it. This can
 result in loss of IPv6 connectivity beyond the local network.


This may be mitigated by disabling processing of IPv6 router
 advertisements if they are not needed:  

`sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra=0`  

`sysctl net.ipv6.conf.<interface>.accept_ra=0`
* [CVE-2015-3331](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3331)
Stephan Mueller discovered that the optimised implementation of
 RFC4106 GCM for x86 processors that support AESNI miscalculated
 buffer addresses in some cases. If an IPsec tunnel is configured to
 use this mode (also known as AES-GCM-ESP) this can lead to memory
 corruption and crashes (even without malicious traffic). This could
 potentially also result in remote code execution.
* [CVE-2015-3332](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3332)
Ben Hutchings discovered that the TCP Fast Open feature regressed
 in Linux 3.16.7-ckt9, resulting in a kernel BUG when it is used.
 This can be used as a local denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-3339](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3339)
It was found that the execve(2) system call can race with inode
 attribute changes made by chown(2). Although chown(2) clears the
 setuid/setgid bits of a file if it changes the respective owner ID,
 this race condition could result in execve(2) setting effective
 uid/gid to the new owner ID, a privilege escalation.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u1. The linux package in wheezy is not affected
by [CVE-2015-3332](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3332).


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt9-3~deb8u1 or earlier versions. Additionally, this
version fixes a regression in the xen-netfront driver ([#782698](https://bugs.debian.org/782698)).


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt9-3 or earlier versions. Additionally, this version
fixes a regression in the xen-netfront driver ([#782698](https://bugs.debian.org/782698)).


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
