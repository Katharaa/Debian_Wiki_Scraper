More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in krb5, the MIT implementation
of Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:


* [CVE-2015-2695](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2695)
It was discovered that applications which call gss\_inquire\_context()
 on a partially-established SPNEGO context can cause the GSS-API
 library to read from a pointer using the wrong type, leading to a
 process crash.
* [CVE-2015-2696](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2696)
It was discovered that applications which call gss\_inquire\_context()
 on a partially-established IAKERB context can cause the GSS-API
 library to read from a pointer using the wrong type, leading to a
 process crash.
* [CVE-2015-2697](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2697)
It was discovered that the build\_principal\_va() function incorrectly
 handles input strings. An authenticated attacker can take advantage
 of this flaw to cause a KDC to crash using a TGS request with a
 large realm field beginning with a null byte.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u4.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.1+dfsg-19+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.13.2+dfsg-3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.13.2+dfsg-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.
