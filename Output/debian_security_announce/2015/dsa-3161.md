Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3161-1 dbus -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
11 Feb 2015
Affected Packages:

[dbus](https://packages.debian.org/src:dbus)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 777545](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=777545).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-0245](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0245).  

More information:

Simon McVittie discovered a local denial of service flaw in dbus, an
asynchronous inter-process communication system. On systems with
systemd-style service activation, dbus-daemon does not prevent forged
ActivationFailure messages from non-root processes. A malicious local
user could use this flaw to trick dbus-daemon into thinking that systemd
failed to activate a system service, resulting in an error reply back to
the requester.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u6.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.16-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.
