In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-7984](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7984).  

More information:

It was discovered that the web-based administration interface in the
Horde Application Framework did not guard against Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) attacks. As a result, other, malicious web pages could
cause Horde applications to perform actions as the Horde user.


The oldstable distribution (wheezy) did not contain php-horde
packages.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.1+debian0-2+deb8u2.


For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 5.2.8+debian0-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php-horde packages.
