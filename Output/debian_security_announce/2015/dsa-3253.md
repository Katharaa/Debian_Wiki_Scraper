More information:

Pound, a HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer, had several issues
related to vulnerabilities in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.


For Debian 7 (wheezy) this update adds a missing part to make it actually
possible to disable client-initiated renegotiation and disables it by default
([CVE-2009-3555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555)).
TLS compression is disabled ([CVE-2012-4929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4929)),
although this is normally already disabled by the OpenSSL system library.
Finally it adds the ability to disable the SSLv3 protocol ([CVE-2014-3566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3566))
entirely via the new DisableSSLv3 configuration directive, although it
will not disabled by default in this update. Additionally a non-security
sensitive issue in redirect encoding is
addressed.


For Debian 8 (jessie) these issues have been fixed prior to the release,
with the exception of client-initiated renegotiation ([CVE-2009-3555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555)).
This update addresses that issue for jessie.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.6-2+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-6+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-6.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your pound packages.
