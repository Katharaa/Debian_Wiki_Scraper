More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in LibreOffice, a
full-featured office productivity:


* [CVE-2015-4551](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4551)
Federico Scrinzi discovered an information leak in the handling of
 ODF documents. Quoting from
 <https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/cve-2015-4551/>:
 The LinkUpdateMode feature controls whether documents inserted into
 Writer or Calc via links will either not get updated, or prompt to
 update, or automatically update, when the parent document is loaded.
 The configuration of this option was stored in the document. That
 flawed approach enabled documents to be crafted with links to
 plausible targets on the victims host computer. The contents of
 those automatically inserted after load links can be concealed in
 hidden sections and retrieved by the attacker if the document is
 saved and returned to sender, or via http requests if the user has
 selected lower security settings for that document.
* [CVE-2015-5212](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5212)
A buffer overflow in parsing the printer setup information in ODF
 documents may result in the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2015-5213](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5213) /
 [CVE-2015-5214](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5214)
A buffer overflow and an integer overflow in parsing
 Microsoft Word documents may result in the execution of arbitrary code.
