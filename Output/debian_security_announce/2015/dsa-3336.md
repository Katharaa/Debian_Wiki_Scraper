More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in nss, the Mozilla Network
Security Service library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:


* [CVE-2015-2721](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2721)
Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that NSS incorrectly handles state
 transitions for the TLS state machine. A man-in-the-middle attacker
 could exploit this flaw to skip the ServerKeyExchange message and
 remove the forward-secrecy property.
* [CVE-2015-2730](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2730)
Watson Ladd discovered that NSS does not properly perform Elliptical
 Curve Cryptography (ECC) multiplication, allowing a remote attacker
 to potentially spoof ECDSA signatures.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:3.14.5-1+deb7u5.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.17.2-1.1+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:3.19.1-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.19.1-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.
