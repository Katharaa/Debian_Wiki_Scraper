Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3279-1 redis -- security update
-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
06 Jun 2015
Affected Packages:

[redis](https://packages.debian.org/src:redis)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-4335](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4335).  

More information:

It was discovered that redis, a persistent key-value database, could
execute insecure Lua bytecode by way of the EVAL command. This could
allow remote attackers to break out of the Lua sandbox and execute
arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:2.8.17-1+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem will be fixed
in version 2:3.0.2-1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.0.2-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your redis packages.
