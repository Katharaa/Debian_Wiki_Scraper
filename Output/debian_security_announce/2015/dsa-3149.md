========================


DSA-3149-1 condor -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
02 Feb 2015
Affected Packages:

[condor](https://packages.debian.org/src:condor)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 775276](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=775276).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2014-8126](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8126).  

More information:

Florian Weimer, of Red Hat Product Security, discovered an issue in
condor, a distributed workload management system. Upon job completion,
it can optionally notify a user by sending an email; the mailx
invocation used in that process allowed for any authenticated user
able to submit jobs, to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the condor user.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.8.2~dfsg.1-1+deb7u3.


For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
8.2.3~dfsg.1-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your condor packages.
