In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-5165](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5165), [CVE-2015-5745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5745).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware.


* [CVE-2015-5165](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5165)
Donghai Zhu discovered that the QEMU model of the RTL8139 network
 card did not sufficiently validate inputs in the C+ mode offload
 emulation, allowing a malicious guest to read uninitialized memory
 from the QEMU process's heap.
* [CVE-2015-5745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5745)
A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the way QEMU
 handles the virtio-serial device. A malicious guest could use this
 flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u9.


We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
