Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3338-1 python-django -- security update
-------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Aug 2015
Affected Packages:

[python-django](https://packages.debian.org/src:python-django)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-5963](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5963), [CVE-2015-5964](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5964).  

More information:

Lin Hua Cheng discovered that a session could be created when anonymously
accessing the django.contrib.auth.views.logout view. This could allow
remote attackers to saturate the session store or cause other users'
session records to be evicted.


Additionally the contrib.sessions.backends.base.SessionBase.flush() and
cache\_db.SessionStore.flush() methods have been modified to avoid
creating a new empty session as well.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.5-1+deb7u13.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.7-1+deb8u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed
shortly.


We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
