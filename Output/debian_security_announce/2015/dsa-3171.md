-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
23 Feb 2015
Affected Packages:

[samba](https://packages.debian.org/src:samba)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-0240](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0240).  

More information:

Richard van Eeden of Microsoft Vulnerability Research discovered that
Samba, a SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server for Unix, contains a
flaw in the netlogon server code which allows remote code execution with
root privileges from an unauthenticated connection.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u5.


We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
