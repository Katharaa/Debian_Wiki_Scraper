More information:

It was discovered that the fix for
[CVE-2013-4422](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4422) in quassel, a
distributed IRC client, was incomplete. This could allow remote
attackers to inject SQL queries after a database reconnection (e.g.
when the backend PostgreSQL server is restarted).


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.10.0-2.3+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.10.0-2.4.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.10.0-2.4.


We recommend that you upgrade your quassel packages.
