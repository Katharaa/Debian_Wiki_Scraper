It was discovered that vzctl, a set of control tools for the OpenVZ

containers based on the presence of an XML file inside the container.
An attacker with local root privileges in a simfs-based container
could gain control over ploop-based containers. Further information on
the prerequisites of such an attack can be found at
[src.openvz.org](https://src.openvz.org/projects/OVZL/repos/vzctl/commits/9e98ea630ac0e88b44e3e23c878a5166aeb74e1c).
