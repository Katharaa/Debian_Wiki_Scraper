More information:

Tilmann Haak from xing.com discovered that XML::LibXML, a Perl interface
to the libxml2 library, did not respect the expand\_entities parameter to
disable processing of external entities in some circumstances. This may
allow attackers to gain read access to otherwise protected resources,
depending on how the library is used.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0001+dfsg-1+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0116+dfsg-1+deb8u1.
