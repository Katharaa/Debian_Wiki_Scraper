Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-3275-1 fusionforge -- security update
-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
30 May 2015
Affected Packages:

[fusionforge](https://packages.debian.org/src:fusionforge)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-0850](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0850).  

More information:

Ansgar Burchardt discovered that the Git plugin for FusionForge, a
web-based project-management and collaboration software, does not
sufficiently validate user provided input as parameter to the method to
create secondary Git repositories. A remote attacker can use this flaw
to execute arbitrary code as root via a specially crafted URL.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.2+20141104-3+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your fusionforge packages.
