--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
03 May 2015
Affected Packages:

[jqueryui](https://packages.debian.org/src:jqueryui)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2010-5312](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-5312).  

More information:

Shadowman131 discovered that jqueryui, a JavaScript UI library for
dynamic web applications, failed to properly sanitize its title
option. This would allow a remote attacker to inject arbitrary code
through cross-site scripting.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.8.ooops.21+dfsg-2+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), testing distribution (stretch)
and unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.1+dfsg-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your jqueryui packages.
