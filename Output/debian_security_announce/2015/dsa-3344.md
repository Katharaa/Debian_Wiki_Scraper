More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the PHP language:


* [CVE-2015-4598](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4598)
thoger at redhat dot com discovered that paths containing a NUL
 character were improperly handled, thus allowing an attacker to
 manipulate unexpected files on the server.
* [CVE-2015-4643](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4643)
Max Spelsberg discovered an integer overflow flaw leading to a
 heap-based buffer overflow in PHP's FTP extension, when parsing

 execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2015-4644](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4644)
A denial of service through a crash could be caused by a segfault
 in the php\_pgsql\_meta\_data function.

sean dot heelan at gmail dot com discovered a problem in the
 unserialization of some items, that could lead to arbitrary code
 execution.


stewie at mail dot ru discovered that the phar extension improperly
 handled zip archives with relative paths, which would allow an
 attacker to overwrite files outside of the destination directory.


taoguangchen at icloud dot com discovered several use-after-free
 vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.4.44-0+deb7u1.
