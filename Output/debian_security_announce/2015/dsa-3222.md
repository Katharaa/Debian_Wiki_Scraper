------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 782160](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=782160).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-1821](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1821), [CVE-2015-1822](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1822), [CVE-2015-1853](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1853).  

More information:

Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat discovered multiple vulnerabilities in chrony,
an alternative NTP client and server:


* [CVE-2015-1821](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1821)
Using particular address/subnet pairs when configuring access control
 would cause an invalid memory write. This could allow attackers to
 cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2015-1822](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1822)
When allocating memory to save unacknowledged replies to authenticated
 command requests, a pointer would be left uninitialized, which could
 trigger an invalid memory write. This could allow attackers to cause a
 denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2015-1853](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1853)
When peering with other NTP hosts using authenticated symmetric
 association, the internal state variables would be updated before the
 MAC of the NTP messages was validated. This could allow a remote
 attacker to cause a denial of service by impeding synchronization
 between NTP peers.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.24-3.1+deb7u3.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.30-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your chrony packages.
