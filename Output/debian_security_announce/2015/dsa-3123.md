More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in binutils, a toolbox for
binary file manipulation. These vulnerabilities include multiple memory
safety errors, buffer overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation
errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security
restrictions, path traversal attack or denial of service.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.22-8+deb7u2.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.25-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your binutils packages.
