-----------------------------------



Date Reported:
15 Jun 2015
Affected Packages:

[p7zip](https://packages.debian.org/src:p7zip)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 774660](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=774660).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-1038](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1038).  

More information:

Alexander Cherepanov discovered that p7zip is susceptible to a
directory traversal vulnerability. While extracting an archive, it
will extract symlinks and then follow them if they are referenced in
further entries. This can be exploited by a rogue archive to write
files outside the current directory.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 9.20.1~dfsg.1-4+deb7u1.


For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.20.1~dfsg.1-4.1+deb8u1.


For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.20.1~dfsg.1-4.2.


We recommend that you upgrade your p7zip packages.
