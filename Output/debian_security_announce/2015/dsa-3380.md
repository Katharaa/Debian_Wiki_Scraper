DSA-3380-1 php5 -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
27 Oct 2015
Affected Packages:

[php5](https://packages.debian.org/src:php5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2015-7803](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7803), [CVE-2015-7804](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7804).  

More information:

Two vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language commonly used for web application development.


* [CVE-2015-7803](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7803)
The phar extension could crash with a NULL pointer dereference
 when processing tar archives containing links referring to
 non-existing files. This could lead to a denial of service.
* [CVE-2015-7804](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7804)
The phar extension does not correctly process directory entries
 found in archive files with the name "/", leading to a denial of
 service and, potentially, information disclosure.


The update for Debian stable (jessie) contains additional bug fixes
from PHP upstream version 5.6.14, as described in the upstream
changelog:


* <https://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.6.14>


Note to users of the oldstable distribution (wheezy): PHP 5.4 has
reached end-of-life on September 14th, 2015. As a result, there will
be no more new upstream releases. The security support of PHP 5.4 in
Debian oldstable (wheezy) will be best effort only, and you are
strongly advised to upgrade to latest Debian stable release (jessie),
which includes PHP 5.6.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.4.45-0+deb7u2.


For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.6.14+dfsg-0+deb8u1.


For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 5.6.14+dfsg-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
