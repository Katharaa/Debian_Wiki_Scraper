More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2021-4037](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4037)
Christian Brauner reported that the inode\_init\_owner function for
 the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel allows local users to create
 files with an unintended group ownership allowing attackers to
 escalate privileges by making a plain file executable and SGID.
* [CVE-2022-0171](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0171)
Mingwei Zhang reported that a cache incoherence issue in the SEV API
 in the KVM subsystem may result in denial of service.
* [CVE-2022-1184](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1184)
A flaw was discovered in the ext4 filesystem driver which can lead
 to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to mount arbitrary
 filesystems could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash
 or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-2602](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2602)
A race between handling an io\_uring request and the Unix socket
 garbage collector was discovered. An attacker can take advantage of
 this flaw for local privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-2663](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2663)
David Leadbeater reported flaws in the nf\_conntrack\_irc
 connection-tracking protocol module. When this module is enabled
 on a firewall, an external user on the same IRC network as an
 internal user could exploit its lax parsing to open arbitrary TCP
 ports in the firewall, to reveal their public IP address, or to
 block their IRC connection at the firewall.
* [CVE-2022-3061](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3061)
A flaw was discovered in the i740 driver which may result in denial
 of service.


This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
 configurations.
* [CVE-2022-3176](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3176)
A use-after-free flaw was discovered in the io\_uring subsystem which
 may result in local privilege escalation to root.
* [CVE-2022-3303](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3303)
A race condition in the snd\_pcm\_oss\_sync function in the sound
 subsystem in the Linux kernel due to improper locking may result in
 denial of service.
* [CVE-2022-20421](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-20421)
A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the
 binder\_inc\_ref\_for\_node function in the Android binder driver. On
 systems where the binder driver is loaded, a local user could
 exploit this for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-39188](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39188)
Jann Horn reported a race condition in the kernel's handling of
 unmapping of certain memory ranges. When a driver created a
 memory mapping with the VM\_PFNMAP flag, which many GPU drivers do,
 the memory mapping could be removed and freed before it was
 flushed from the CPU TLBs. This could result in a page use-after-free.
 A local user with access to such a device could exploit
 this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
 possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-39842](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39842)
An integer overflow was discovered in the pxa3xx-gcu video driver
 which could lead to a heap out-of-bounds write.


This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
 configurations.
* [CVE-2022-40307](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-40307)
A race condition was discovered in the EFI capsule-loader driver,
 which could lead to use-after-free. A local user permitted to
 access this device (/dev/efi\_capsule\_loader) could exploit this to
 cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
 for privilege escalation. However, this device is normally only
 accessible by the root user.
* [CVE-2022-41674](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-41674),
 [CVE-2022-42719](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42719),
 [CVE-2022-42720](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42720),
 [CVE-2022-42721](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42721),
 [CVE-2022-42722](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42722)
Soenke Huster discovered several vulnerabilities in the mac80211
 subsystem triggered by WLAN frames which may result in denial of
 service or the execution or arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.149-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
