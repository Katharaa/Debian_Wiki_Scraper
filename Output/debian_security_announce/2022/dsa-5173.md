 service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2022-1516](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1516)
A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25
 set of standardized network protocols, which can result in denial
 of service.


This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
 configurations.
* [CVE-2022-1652](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1652)
Minh Yuan discovered a race condition in the floppy driver that
 can lead to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
 floppy drive device can exploit this to cause a denial of service
 (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-1729](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1729)
Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the perf subsystem
 which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The

 permissive settings have been applied in the
 kernel.perf\_event\_paranoid sysctl.
* [CVE-2022-1734](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1734)
Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver
 that could lead to a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer
 dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
 denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
 privilege escalation.


This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
 configurations.
* [CVE-2022-1974](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1974),
 [CVE-2022-1975](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1975)

 suspectible to denial of service.
* [CVE-2022-2153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2153)
kangel reported a flaw in the KVM implementation for x86
 processors which could lead to a null pointer dereference. A local
 user permitted to access /dev/kvm could exploit this to cause a
 denial of service (crash).
* [CVE-2022-21123](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-21123),
 [CVE-2022-21125](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-21125),
 [CVE-2022-21166](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-21166)
Various researchers discovered flaws in Intel x86 processors,
 collectively referred to as MMIO Stale Data vulnerabilities.
 These are similar to the previously published Microarchitectural
 Data Sampling (MDS) issues and could be exploited by local users
 to leak sensitive information.


For some CPUs, the mitigations for these issues require updated
 microcode. An updated intel-microcode package may be provided at
 a later date. The updated CPU microcode may also be available as
 part of a system firmware ("BIOS") update.


Further information on the mitigation can be found at
 <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/processor_mmio_stale_data.html>
 or in the linux-doc-4.19 package.
* [CVE-2022-23960](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23960)
Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
 Arm processors can be exploited to create information side
 channels with speculative execution. This issue is similar to
 Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
 processors.


This was previously mitigated for 32-bit Arm (armel and armhf)
 architectures and is now also mitigated for 64-bit Arm (arm64).


This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
 different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
 or from a KVM guest to the kernel.
* [CVE-2022-26490](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-26490)
Buffer overflows in the STMicroelectronics ST21NFCA core driver
 can result in denial of service or privilege escalation.


This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
 configurations.
* [CVE-2022-27666](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-27666)
valis reported a possible buffer overflow in the IPsec ESP
 transformation code. A local user can take advantage of this flaw
 to cause a denial of service or for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-28356](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28356)
Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did
 not properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A
 local attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial
 of service.
* [CVE-2022-28388](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28388)
A double free vulnerability was discovered in the 8 devices
 USB2CAN interface driver.
* [CVE-2022-28389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28389)
A double free vulnerability was discovered in the Microchip CAN
 BUS Analyzer interface driver.
* [CVE-2022-28390](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28390)
A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-USB/ARM7
 CAN/USB interface driver.
* [CVE-2022-29581](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-29581)
Kyle Zeng discovered a reference-counting bug in the cls\_u32
 network classifier which can lead to a use-after-free. A local
 user can exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
 memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-30594](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-30594)
Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between ptrace and
 seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still
 permitted to use ptrace() could exploit this to remove the seccomp
 restrictions.
* [CVE-2022-32250](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32250)
Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter which may
 result in local privilege escalation to root.
* [CVE-2022-33981](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-33981)
Yuan Ming from Tsinghua University reported a race condition in
 the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl, which could
 lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy
 drive device could exploit this to cause a denial of service
 (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.
 This ioctl is now disabled by default.


For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.19.249-2.


Due to an issue in the signing service (Cf. Debian bug #1012741), the
vport-vxlan module cannot be loaded for the signed kernel for amd64 in
this update.


This update also corrects a regression in the network scheduler
subsystem (bug #1013299).


For the 32-bit Arm (armel and armhf) architectures, this update
enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
algorithms. For at least AES, this should remove a timing sidechannel
that could lead to a leak of sensitive information.


This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates
4.19.236-4.19.249 inclusive, including for bug #1006346. The random
driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous
performance and correctness issues. Some changes will be visible:


* The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096. You may need
 to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space
 entropy gathering services to allow for this.
* On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel may log more uses of
 /dev/urandom before it is fully initialised. These uses were
 previously under-counted and this is not a regression.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
