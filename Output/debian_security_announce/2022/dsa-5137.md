DSA-5137-1 needrestart -- security update
-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
17 May 2022
Affected Packages:

[needrestart](https://packages.debian.org/src:needrestart)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-30688](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-30688).  

More information:

Jakub Wilk discovered a local privilege escalation in needrestart, a
utility to check which daemons need to be restarted after library
upgrades. Regular expressions to detect the Perl, Python, and Ruby
interpreters are not anchored, allowing a local user to escalate
privileges when needrestart tries to detect if interpreters are using
old source files.


For the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.4-5+deb10u1.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5-4+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your needrestart packages.
