DSA-5307-1 libcommons-net-java -- security update
-------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
29 Dec 2022
Affected Packages:

[libcommons-net-java](https://packages.debian.org/src:libcommons-net-java)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1025910](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1025910).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-37533](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-37533).  

More information:

ZeddYu Lu discovered that the FTP client of Apache Commons Net, a Java
client API for basic Internet protocols, trusts the host from PASV response
by default. A malicious server can redirect the Commons Net code to use a
different host, but the user has to connect to the malicious server in the
first place. This may lead to leakage of information about services running
on the private network of the client.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6-1+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libcommons-net-java packages.
