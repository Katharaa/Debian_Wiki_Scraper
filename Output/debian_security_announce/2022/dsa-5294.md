More information:

Jhead, a tool for manipulating EXIF data embedded in JPEG images, allowed
attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands by placing them in a JPEG filename
and then using the regeneration -rgt50, -autorot or -ce option. In addition a
buffer overflow error in exif.c has been addressed which could lead to a denial
of service (application crash).


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:3.04-6+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your jhead packages.
