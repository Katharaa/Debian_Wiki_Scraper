Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1007109](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1007109).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-36518](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-36518), [CVE-2022-42003](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42003), [CVE-2022-42004](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42004).  

More information:

Several flaws were discovered in jackson-databind, a fast and powerful JSON
library for Java.


* [CVE-2020-36518](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-36518)
Java StackOverflow exception and denial of service via a large depth of
 nested objects.
* [CVE-2022-42003](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42003)
In FasterXML jackson-databind resource exhaustion can occur because of a
 lack of a check in primitive value deserializers to avoid deep wrapper
 array nesting, when the UNWRAP\_SINGLE\_VALUE\_ARRAYS feature is enabled.
* [CVE-2022-42004](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42004)
In FasterXML jackson-databind resource exhaustion can occur because of a
 lack of a check in BeanDeserializerBase.deserializeFromArray to prevent use
 of deeply nested arrays. An application is vulnerable only with certain
 customized choices for deserialization.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.12.1-1+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your jackson-databind packages.
