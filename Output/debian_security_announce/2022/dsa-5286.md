========================


DSA-5286-1 krb5 -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
19 Nov 2022
Affected Packages:

[krb5](https://packages.debian.org/src:krb5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1024267](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1024267).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-42898](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42898).  

More information:

Greg Hudson discovered integer overflow flaws in the PAC parsing in
krb5, the MIT implementation of Kerberos, which may result in remote
code execution (in a KDC, kadmin, or GSS or Kerberos application server
process), information exposure (to a cross-realm KDC acting
maliciously), or denial of service (KDC or kadmind process crash).


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.18.3-6+deb11u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.
