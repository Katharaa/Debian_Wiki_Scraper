More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Heimdal, an implementation of
Kerberos 5 that aims to be compatible with MIT Kerberos.


* [CVE-2021-3671](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3671)
Joseph Sutton discovered that the Heimdal KDC does not validate that
 the server name in the TGS-REQ is present before dereferencing,
 which may result in denial of service.
* [CVE-2021-44758](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-44758)
It was discovered that Heimdal is prone to a NULL dereference in
 acceptors where an initial SPNEGO token that has no acceptable
 mechanisms, which may result in denial of service for a server
 application that uses SPNEGO.
* [CVE-2022-3437](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3437)
Several buffer overflow flaws and non-constant time leaks were
 discovered when using 1DES, 3DES or RC4 (arcfour).
* [CVE-2022-41916](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-41916)
An out-of-bounds memory access was discovered when Heimdal
 normalizes Unicode, which may result in denial of service.
* [CVE-2022-42898](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42898)
It was discovered that integer overflows in PAC parsing may result
 in denial of service for Heimdal KDCs or possibly Heimdal servers.
* [CVE-2022-44640](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-44640)
It was discovered that the Heimdal's ASN.1 compiler generates code
 that allows specially crafted DER encodings to invoke an invalid
 free on the decoded structure upon decode error, which may result in
 remote code execution in the Heimdal KDC.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.7.0+dfsg-2+deb11u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages.
