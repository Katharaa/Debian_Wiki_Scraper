More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2022-0494](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0494)
The scsi\_ioctl() was susceptible to an information leak only
 exploitable by users with CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN or CAP\_SYS\_RAWIO
 capabilities.
* [CVE-2022-0854](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0854)
Ali Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA
 subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature is needed, this
 might allow a local user to read sensitive information.
* [CVE-2022-1012](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1012)
The randomisation when calculating port offsets in the IP
 implementation was enhanced.
* [CVE-2022-1729](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1729)
Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the perf subsystem
 which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The
 default settings in Debian prevent exploitation unless more
 permissive settings have been applied in the
 kernel.perf\_event\_paranoid sysctl.
* [CVE-2022-1786](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1786)
Kyle Zeng discovered a use-after-free in the io\_uring subsystem
 which way result in local privilege escalation to root.
* [CVE-2022-1789](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1789) /
 [CVE-2022-1852](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1852)
Yongkang Jia, Gaoning Pan and Qiuhao Li discovered two NULL pointer
 dereferences in KVM's CPU instruction handling, resulting in denial
 of service.
* [CVE-2022-32250](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32250)
Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter which may
 result in local privilege escalation to root.
* [CVE-2022-1974](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1974) /
 [CVE-2022-1975](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1975)
Duoming Zhou discovered that the NFC netlink interface was
 suspectible to denial of service.
* [CVE-2022-2078](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2078)
Ziming Zhang discovered an out-of-bound write in Netfilter which may
 result in local privilege escalation to root.
* [CVE-2022-21499](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-21499)
It was discovered that the kernel debugger could be used to bypass
 UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.
* [CVE-2022-28893](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28893)
Felix Fu discovered a use-after-free in the implementation of the
 Remote Procedure Call (SunRPC) protocol, which could result in denial of
 service or an information leak.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.120-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
