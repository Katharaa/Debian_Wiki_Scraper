DSA-5216-1 libxslt -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 Aug 2022
Affected Packages:

[libxslt](https://packages.debian.org/src:libxslt)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-30560](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-30560).  

More information:

Nick Wellnhofer discovered that the xsltApplyTemplates function in
libxslt, an XSLT processing runtime library, is prone to a
use-after-free flaw, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially
the execution of arbitrary code if a specially crafted file is
processed.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.34-4+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libxslt packages.
