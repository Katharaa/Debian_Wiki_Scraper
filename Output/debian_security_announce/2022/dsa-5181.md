* [CVE-2022-25802](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-25802)
It was discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to a cross-site
 scripting (XSS) attack when displaying attachment content with
 fraudulent content types.


Additionally it was discovered that Request Tracker did not perform full
rights checks on accesses to file or image type custom fields, possibly
allowing access to these custom fields by users without rights to access
to the associated objects, resulting in information disclosure.
