DSA-5213-1 schroot -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Aug 2022
Affected Packages:

[schroot](https://packages.debian.org/src:schroot)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-2787](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2787).  

More information:

Julian Gilbey discovered that schroot, a tool allowing users to execute
commands in a chroot environment, had too permissive rules on chroot or
session names, allowing a denial of service on the schroot service for
all users that may start a schroot session.


Note that existing chroots and sessions are checked during upgrade, and
an upgrade is aborted if any future invalid name is detected.


Problematic session and chroots can be checked before upgrading with the
following command:


`schroot --list --all | LC_ALL=C grep -vE '^[a-z]+:[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*$'`
See
<https://codeberg.org/shelter/reschroot/src/tag/release/reschroot-1.6.13/NEWS#L10-L41>
for instructions on how to resolve such a situation.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.10-12+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your schroot packages.
