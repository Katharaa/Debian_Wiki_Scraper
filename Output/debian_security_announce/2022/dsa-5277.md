More information:

Multiple security issues were discovered in PHP, a widely-used open
source general purpose scripting language which could result in denial
of service, information disclosure, insecure cookies handling or
potentially the execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.4.33-1+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php7.4 packages.
