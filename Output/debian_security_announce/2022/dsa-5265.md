More information:

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine.


* [CVE-2021-43980](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43980)
The simplified implementation of blocking reads and writes introduced in
 Tomcat 10 and back-ported to Tomcat 9.0.47 onwards exposed a long standing
 (but extremely hard to trigger) concurrency bug that could cause client
 connections to share an Http11Processor instance resulting in responses, or
 part responses, to be received by the wrong client.
* [CVE-2022-23181](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23181)
The fix for bug [CVE-2020-9484](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-9484) introduced a time of check, time of use
 vulnerability into Apache Tomcat that allowed a local attacker to perform
 actions with the privileges of the user that the Tomcat process is using.
 This issue is only exploitable when Tomcat is configured to persist
 sessions using the FileStore.
* [CVE-2022-29885](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-29885)
The documentation of Apache Tomcat for the EncryptInterceptor incorrectly
 stated it enabled Tomcat clustering to run over an untrusted network. This
 was not correct. While the EncryptInterceptor does provide confidentiality
 and integrity protection, it does not protect against all risks associated
 with running over any untrusted network, particularly DoS risks.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.0.43-2~deb11u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat9 packages.
