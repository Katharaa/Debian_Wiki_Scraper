DSA-5248-1 php-twig -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
04 Oct 2022
Affected Packages:

[php-twig](https://packages.debian.org/src:php-twig)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1020991](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1020991).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-39261](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39261).  

More information:

Marlon Starkloff discovered that twig, a template engine for PHP, did
not correctly enforce sandboxing. This would allow a malicious user to
execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.14.3-1+deb11u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your php-twig packages.
