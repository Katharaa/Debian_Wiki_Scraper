DSA-5296-1 xfce4-settings -- security update
--------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
06 Dec 2022
Affected Packages:

[xfce4-settings](https://packages.debian.org/src:xfce4-settings)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1023732](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1023732).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-45062](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-45062).  

More information:

Robin Peraglie and Johannes Moritz discovered an argument injection bug in the
xfce4-mime-helper component of xfce4-settings, which can be exploited using the
xdg-open common tool. Since xdg-open is used by multiple standard applications
for opening links, this bug could be exploited by an attacker to run arbitrary
code on an user machine by providing a malicious PDF file with specifically
crafted links.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.16.0-1+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your xfce4-settings packages.
