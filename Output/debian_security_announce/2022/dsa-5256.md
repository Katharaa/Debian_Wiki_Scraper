Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-5256-1 bcel -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Oct 2022
Affected Packages:

[bcel](https://packages.debian.org/src:bcel)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1015860](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1015860).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-34169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-34169).  

More information:

The Apache Xalan Java XSLT library is vulnerable to an integer truncation
issue when processing malicious XSLT stylesheets. This can be used to corrupt
Java class files generated by the internal XSLTC compiler and execute arbitrary
Java bytecode. In Debian the vulnerable code is in the bcel source package.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.5.0-1+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your bcel packages.
