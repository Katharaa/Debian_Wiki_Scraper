More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2021-4197](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4197)
Eric Biederman reported that incorrect permission checks in the
 cgroup process migration implementation can allow a local attacker
 to escalate privileges.
* [CVE-2022-0168](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0168)
A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the CIFS client
 implementation which can allow a local attacker with CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN
 privileges to crash the system. The security impact is negligible as
 CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN inherently gives the ability to deny service.
* [CVE-2022-1016](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1016)
David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
 nft\_do\_chain function did not initialize register data that
 nf\_tables expressions can read from and write to. A local attacker
 can take advantage of this to read sensitive information.
* [CVE-2022-1048](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1048)
Hu Jiahui discovered a race condition in the sound subsystem that
 can result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
 PCM sound device can take advantage of this flaw to crash the
 system or potentially for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-1158](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1158)
Qiuhao Li, Gaoning Pan, and Yongkang Jia discovered a bug in the
 KVM implementation for x86 processors. A local user with access to
 /dev/kvm could cause the MMU emulator to update page table entry
 flags at the wrong address. They could exploit this to cause a
 denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
 privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-1195](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1195)
Lin Ma discovered race conditions in the 6pack and mkiss hamradio
 drivers, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could
 exploit these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
 crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-1198](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1198)
Duoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio
 driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could
 exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
 crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-1199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1199),
 [CVE-2022-1204](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1204),
 [CVE-2022-1205](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1205)
Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 hamradio
 protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer
 dereference. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of
 service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2022-1353](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1353)
The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF\_KEY
 subsystem. A local user can receive a netlink message when an
 IPsec daemon registers with the kernel, and this could include
 sensitive information.
* [CVE-2022-1516](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1516)
A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25
 set of standardized network protocols, which can result in denial
 of service.


This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
 configurations.
* [CVE-2022-26490](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-26490)
Buffer overflows in the STMicroelectronics ST21NFCA core driver can
 result in denial of service or privilege escalation.


This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
 configurations.
* [CVE-2022-27666](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-27666)
valis reported a possible buffer overflow in the IPsec ESP
 transformation code. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to
 cause a denial of service or for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-28356](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28356)
Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did
 not properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A
 local attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial
 of service.
* [CVE-2022-28388](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28388)
A double free vulnerability was discovered in the 8 devices USB2CAN
 interface driver.
* [CVE-2022-28389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28389)
A double free vulnerability was discovered in the Microchip CAN BUS
 Analyzer interface driver.
* [CVE-2022-28390](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-28390)
A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-USB/ARM7
 CAN/USB interface driver.
* [CVE-2022-29582](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-29582)
Jayden Rivers and David Bouman discovered a user-after-free
 vulnerability in the io\_uring subystem due to a race condition in
 io\_uring timeouts. A local unprivileged user can take advantage of
 this flaw for privilege escalation.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.113-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
