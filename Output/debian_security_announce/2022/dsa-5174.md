More information:

Demi Marie Obenour discovered a flaw in GnuPG, allowing for signature
spoofing via arbitrary injection into the status line. An attacker who
controls the secret part of any signing-capable key or subkey in the
victim's keyring, can take advantage of this flaw to provide a
correctly-formed signature that some software, including gpgme, will
accept to have validity and signer fingerprint chosen from the attacker.


For the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.2.12-1+deb10u2.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.27-2+deb11u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg2 packages.
