More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser, which could potentially result in the execution of arbitrary
code, CSP bypass or session fixation.


Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 91.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 102.x releases.


Between 91.x and 102.x, Firefox has seen a number of feature updates.
For more information please refer to
<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/102.0esr/releasenotes/>


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 102.3.0esr-1~deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.
