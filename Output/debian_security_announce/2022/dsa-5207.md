More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2022-2585](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2585)
A use-after-free flaw in the implementation of POSIX CPU timers may
 result in denial of service or in local privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-2586](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2586)
A use-after-free in the Netfilter subsystem may result in local
 privilege escalation for a user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability in
 any user or network namespace.
* [CVE-2022-2588](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2588)
Zhenpeng Lin discovered a use-after-free flaw in the cls\_route
 filter implementation which may result in local privilege escalation
 for a user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability in any user or network
 namespace.
* [CVE-2022-26373](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-26373)
It was discovered that on certain processors with Intel's Enhanced
 Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) capabilities there
 are exceptions to the documented properties in some situations,
 which may result in information disclosure.


Intel's explanation of the issue can be found at
 <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/post-barrier-return-stack-buffer-predictions.html>
* [CVE-2022-29900](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-29900)
Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi reported that for AMD/Hygon
 processors, mis-trained branch predictions for return instructions
 may allow arbitrary speculative code execution under certain
 microarchitecture-dependent conditions.

 <https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-1037>
* [CVE-2022-29901](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-29901)
Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi reported that for Intel processors
 (Intel Core generation 6, 7 and 8), protections against speculative
 branch target injection attacks were insufficient in some
 circumstances, which may allow arbitrary speculative code execution
 under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.


More information can be found at
 <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/return-stack-buffer-underflow.html>
* [CVE-2022-36879](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-36879)
A flaw was discovered in xfrm\_expand\_policies in the xfrm subsystem
 which can cause a reference count to be dropped twice.
* [CVE-2022-36946](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-36946)
Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera reported a memory
 corruption flaw in the Netfilter subsystem which may result in
 denial of service.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.136-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
