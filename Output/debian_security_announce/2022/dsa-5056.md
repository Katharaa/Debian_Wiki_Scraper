Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-45079](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45079).  

More information:

Zhuowei Zhang discovered a bug in the EAP authentication client code of
strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec suite, that may allow to bypass the client and in some
scenarios even the server authentication, or could lead to a denial-of-service
attack.


When using EAP authentication (RFC 3748), the successful completion of the
authentication is indicated by an EAP-Success message sent by the server to the
client. strongSwan's EAP client code handled early EAP-Success messages
incorrectly, either crashing the IKE daemon or concluding the EAP method
prematurely.


End result depend on the used configuration, more details can be found in
