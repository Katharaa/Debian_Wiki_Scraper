Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-5078-1 zsh -- security update
---------------------------------



Date Reported:
16 Feb 2022
Affected Packages:

[zsh](https://packages.debian.org/src:zsh)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-45444](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45444).  

More information:

It was discovered that zsh, a powerful shell and scripting language,
did not prevent recursive prompt expansion. This would allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary commands into a user's shell, for
instance by tricking a vcs\_info user into checking out a git branch
with a specially crafted name.


For the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.7.1-1+deb10u1.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.8-6+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your zsh packages.
