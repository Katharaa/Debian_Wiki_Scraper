More information:

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in smarty3, the compiling
PHP template engine. Template authors are able to run restricted static php
methods or even arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string or by
choosing an invalid {block} or {include} file name. If a math string was passed
through as user provided data to the math function, remote users were able to
run arbitrary PHP code as well.


For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.1.33+20180830.1.3a78a21f+selfpack1-1+deb10u1.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.39-2+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your smarty3 packages.
