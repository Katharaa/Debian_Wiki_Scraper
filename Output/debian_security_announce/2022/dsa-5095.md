Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 990279](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=990279).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-36310](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-36310), [CVE-2022-0001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0001), [CVE-2022-0002](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0002), [CVE-2022-0487](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0487), [CVE-2022-0492](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0492), [CVE-2022-0617](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0617), [CVE-2022-25636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-25636).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2020-36310](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-36310)
A flaw was discovered in the KVM implementation for AMD processors,
 which could lead to an infinite loop. A malicious VM guest could
 exploit this to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2022-0001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0001) (INTEL-SA-00598)
 Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
 Intel processors can be exploited to create information side channels with speculative execution. This issue is similar to
 Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
 processors.


This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
 different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
 or from a KVM guest to the kernel.
* [CVE-2022-0002](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0002) (INTEL-SA-00598)
 This is a similar issue to [CVE-2022-0001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0001), but covers exploitation
 within a security context, such as from JIT-compiled code in a
 sandbox to hosting code in the same process.


This is partly mitigated by disabling eBPF for unprivileged users
 with the sysctl: kernel.unprivileged\_bpf\_disabled=2. This is
 already the default in Debian 11 bullseye.
* [CVE-2022-0487](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0487)
A use-after-free was discovered in the MOXART SD/MMC Host Controller
 support driver. This flaw does not impact the Debian binary packages
 as CONFIG\_MMC\_MOXART is not set.
* [CVE-2022-0492](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0492)
Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang reported that the cgroup-v1 subsystem does
 not properly restrict access to the release-agent feature. A local
 user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation and
 bypass of namespace isolation.
* [CVE-2022-0617](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0617)
butt3rflyh4ck discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the UDF
 filesystem. A local user that can mount a specially crafted UDF
 image can use this flaw to crash the system.
* [CVE-2022-25636](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-25636)
Nick Gregory reported a heap out-of-bounds write flaw in the
 netfilter subsystem. A user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could
 use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.10.103-1. This update additionally includes many more
bug fixes from stable updates 5.10.93-5.10.103 inclusive.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
