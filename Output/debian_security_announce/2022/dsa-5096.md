More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2020-29374](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-29374)
Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
 management. A parent and child process initially share all their
 memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
 duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write). However, in case an
 operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
 additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
 during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
 process's memory. For some programs, this could lead to an
 information leak or data corruption.


This issue was already fixed for most architectures, but not on
 MIPS and System z. This update corrects that.
* [CVE-2020-36322](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-36322),
 [CVE-2021-28950](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28950)
The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
 implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
 invalid attributes for a file. A local user permitted to run a
 FUSE server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).


The original fix for this introduced a different potential denial
 of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has also been
 fixed.
* [CVE-2021-3640](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3640)
Lin Ma discovered a race condiiton in the Bluetooth protocol
 implementation that can lead to a use-after-free. A local
 user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
 corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2021-3744](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3744),
 [CVE-2021-3764](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3764)
minihanshen reported bugs in the ccp driver for AMD
 Cryptographic Coprocessors that could lead to a resource leak.
 On systems using this driver, a local user could exploit this to
 cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2021-3752](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3752)
Likang Luo of NSFOCUS Security Team discovered a flaw in the
 Bluetooth L2CAP implementation that can lead to a user-after-free.
 A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
 (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2021-3760](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3760),
 [CVE-2021-4202](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4202)
Lin Ma discovered race conditions in the NCI (NFC Controller
 Interface) driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local
 user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
 corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.


This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
 configurations.
* [CVE-2021-3772](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3772)
A flaw was found in the SCTP protocol implementation, which would
 allow a networked attacker to break an SCTP association. The
 attacker would only need to know or guess the IP addresses and
 ports for the association.
* [CVE-2021-4002](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4002)
It was discovered that hugetlbfs, the virtual filesystem used by
 applications to allocate huge pages in RAM, did not flush the
 CPU's TLB in one case where it was necessary. In some
 circumstances a local user would be able to read and write huge
 pages after they are freed and reallocated to a different process.
 This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or
 information leaks.
* [CVE-2021-4083](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4083)
Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
 garbage collector, that can lead to use-after-free. A local user
 could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
 or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2021-4135](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4135)
A flaw was found in the netdevsim driver which would lead to an
 information leak.


This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
 configurations.
* [CVE-2021-4155](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4155)
Kirill Tkhai discovered a data leak in the way the XFS\_IOC\_ALLOCSP
 IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for a size increase of files
 with unaligned size. A local attacker can take advantage of this
 flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem.
* [CVE-2021-4203](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4203)
Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
 implementation that can lead to a use-after-free. A local user
 could exploit this to leak sensitive information from the kernel.
* [CVE-2021-20317](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20317)
It was discovered that the timer queue structure could become
 corrupt, leading to waiting tasks never being woken up. A local
 user with certain privileges could exploit this to cause a denial
 of service (system hang).
* [CVE-2021-20321](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20321)
A race condition was discovered in the overlayfs filesystem
 driver. A local user with access to an overlayfs mount and to its
 underlying upper directory could exploit this for privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2021-20322](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20322)
An information leak was discovered in the IPv4 implementation. A
 remote attacker could exploit this to quickly discover which UDP
 ports a system is using, making it easier for them to carry out a
 DNS poisoning attack against that system.
* [CVE-2021-22600](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22600)
The syzbot tool found a flaw in the packet socket (AF\_PACKET)
 implementation which could lead to incorrectly freeing memory. A
 local user with CAP\_NET\_RAW capability (in any user namespace)
 could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
 crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2021-28711](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28711),
 [CVE-2021-28712](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28712),
 [CVE-2021-28713](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28713) (XSA-391)
 Juergen Gross reported that malicious PV backends can cause a denial
 of service to guests being serviced by those backends via high
 frequency events, even if those backends are running in a less
 privileged environment.
* [CVE-2021-28714](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28714),
 [CVE-2021-28715](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28715) (XSA-392)
 Juergen Gross discovered that Xen guests can force the Linux
 netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory, resulting in
 denial of service.
* [CVE-2021-38300](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38300)
Piotr Krysiuk discovered a flaw in the classic BPF (cBPF) JIT
 compiler for MIPS architectures. A local user could exploit
 this to excute arbitrary code in the kernel.


This issue is mitigated by setting sysctl
 net.core.bpf\_jit\_enable=0, which is the default. It is \*not\*
 mitigated by disabling unprivileged use of eBPF.
* [CVE-2021-39685](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-39685)
Szymon Heidrich discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
 USB gadget subsystem, resulting in information disclosure, denial of
 service or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2021-39686](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-39686)
A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, that
 could lead to incorrect security checks. On systems where the
 binder driver is loaded, a local user could exploit this for
 privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2021-39698](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-39698)
Linus Torvalds reported a flaw in the file polling implementation,
 which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit
 this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
 possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2021-39713](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-39713)
The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling
 subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user
 could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
 crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2021-41864](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-41864)
An integer overflow was discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF)
 subsystem. A local user could exploit this for denial of service
 (memory corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege
 escalation.


This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
 kernel.unprivileged\_bpf\_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
 unprivileged users.
* [CVE-2021-42739](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-42739)
A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the firedtv driver for
 FireWire-connected DVB receivers. A local user with access to a
 firedtv device could exploit this for denial of service (memory
 corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2021-43389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43389)
The Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a flaw in the CMTP
 subsystem as used by Bluetooth, which could lead to an
 out-of-bounds read and object type confusion. A local user with
 CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability in the initial user namespace could
 exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash),
 or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2021-43975](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43975)
Brendan Dolan-Gavitt reported a flaw in the
 hw\_atl\_utils\_fw\_rpc\_wait() function in the aQuantia AQtion ethernet
 device driver which can result in denial of service or the execution
 of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2021-43976](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43976)
Zekun Shen and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered a flaw in the
 mwifiex\_usb\_recv() function of the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB Driver. An
 attacker able to connect a crafted USB device can take advantage of
 this flaw to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2021-44733](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-44733)
A race condition was discovered in the Trusted Execution
 Environment (TEE) subsystem for Arm processors, which could lead
 to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a TEE
 device could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
 or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2021-45095](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45095)
It was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) driver
 has a reference count leak in the pep\_sock\_accept() function.
* [CVE-2021-45469](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45469)
Wenqing Liu reported an out-of-bounds memory access in the f2fs
 implementation if an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. An
 attacker able to mount a specially crafted image can take advantage
 of this flaw for denial of service.
* [CVE-2021-45480](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45480)
A memory leak flaw was discovered in the \_\_rds\_conn\_create()
 function in the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol subsystem.
* [CVE-2022-0001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0001) (INTEL-SA-00598)
 Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
 Intel processors can be exploited to create information side
 channels with speculative execution. This issue is similar to
 Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
 processors.


This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
 different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
 or from a KVM guest to the kernel.
* [CVE-2022-0002](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0002) (INTEL-SA-00598)
 This is a similar issue to
 [CVE-2022-0001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0001), but covers exploitation
 within a security context, such as from JIT-compiled code in a
 sandbox to hosting code in the same process.


This can be partly mitigated by disabling eBPF for unprivileged
 users with the sysctl: kernel.unprivileged\_bpf\_disabled=2. This
 update does that by default.
* [CVE-2022-0322](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0322)
Eiichi Tsukata discovered a flaw in the sctp\_make\_strreset\_req()
 function in the SCTP network protocol implementation which can
 result in denial of service.

Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered a missing GPU TLB flush in the
 i915 driver, resulting in denial of service or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-0435](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0435)
Samuel Page and Eric Dumazet reported a stack overflow in the
 networking module for the Transparent Inter-Process Communication
 (TIPC) protocol, resulting in denial of service or potentially the
 execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2022-0487](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0487)
A use-after-free was discovered in the MOXART SD/MMC Host Controller
 support driver. This flaw does not impact the Debian binary packages
 as CONFIG\_MMC\_MOXART is not set.
* [CVE-2022-0492](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0492)
Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang reported that the cgroup-v1 subsystem does
 not properly restrict access to the release-agent feature. A local
 user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation and
 bypass of namespace isolation.
* [CVE-2022-0617](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0617)
butt3rflyh4ck discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the UDF
 filesystem. A local user that can mount a specially crafted UDF
 image can use this flaw to crash the system.
* [CVE-2022-22942](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-22942)
It was discovered that wrong file file descriptor handling in the
 VMware Virtual GPU driver (vmwgfx) could result in information leak
 or privilege escalation.
