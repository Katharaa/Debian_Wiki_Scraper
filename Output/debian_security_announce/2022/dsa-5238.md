More information:

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird, which could
result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:102.3.0-1~deb11u1. Debian follows the Thunderbird upstream
releases. Support for the 91.x series has ended, so starting with this
update we're now following the 102.x series.


We recommend that you upgrade your thunderbird packages.
