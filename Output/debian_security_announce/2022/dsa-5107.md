DSA-5107-1 php-twig -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 Mar 2022
Affected Packages:

[php-twig](https://packages.debian.org/src:php-twig)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-23614](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23614).  

More information:

Marlon Starkloff discovered that twig, a template engine for PHP, did
not correctly enforce sandboxing. This would allow a malicious user to
execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.14.3-1+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php-twig packages.
