More information:

Peter Agten discovered that several modules for TCP syslog reception in
rsyslog, a system and kernel logging daemon, have buffer overflow flaws
when octet-counted framing is used, which could result in denial of
service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 8.1901.0-1+deb10u2.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.2102.0-2+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your rsyslog packages.
