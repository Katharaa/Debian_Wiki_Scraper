More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ISC DHCP client,
relay and server.


* [CVE-2022-2928](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2928)
It was discovered that the DHCP server does not correctly perform
 option reference counting when configured with "allow leasequery;".
 A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial
 of service (daemon crash).
* [CVE-2022-2929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2929)
It was discovered that the DHCP server is prone to a memory leak
 flaw when handling contents of option 81 (fqdn) data received in
 a DHCP packet. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw
 to cause DHCP servers to consume resources, resulting in denial
 of service.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.1-2.3+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.
