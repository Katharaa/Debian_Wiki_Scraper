More information:

Several security vulnerabilities have been found in libpgjava, the official
PostgreSQL JDBC Driver.


* [CVE-2020-13692](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13692)
An XML External Entity (XXE) weakness was found in PostgreSQL JDBC.
* [CVE-2022-21724](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-21724)
The JDBC driver did not verify if certain classes implemented the expected
 interface before instantiating the class. This can lead to code execution
 loaded via arbitrary classes.
* [CVE-2022-26520](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-26520)
An attacker (who controls the jdbc URL or properties) can call
 java.util.logging.FileHandler to write to arbitrary files through the
 loggerFile and loggerLevel connection properties.


For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 42.2.5-2+deb10u1.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 42.2.15-1+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libpgjava packages.
