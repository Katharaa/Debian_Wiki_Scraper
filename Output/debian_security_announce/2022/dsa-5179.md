More information:

Charles Fol discovered two security issues in PHP, a widely-used open
source general purpose scripting language which could result an denial of
service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code:


* [CVE-2022-31625](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-31625)
Incorrect memory handling in the pg\_query\_params() function.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
