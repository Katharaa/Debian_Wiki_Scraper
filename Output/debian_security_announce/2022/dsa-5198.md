More information:

Two security vulnerabilities were discovered in Jetty, a Java servlet engine
and webserver.


* [CVE-2022-2047](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2047)
In Eclipse Jetty the parsing of the authority segment of an http scheme
 URI, the Jetty HttpURI class improperly detects an invalid input as a
 hostname. This can lead to failures in a Proxy scenario.
* [CVE-2022-2048](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2048)
In Eclipse Jetty HTTP/2 server implementation, when encountering an invalid
 HTTP/2 request, the error handling has a bug that can wind up not properly
 cleaning up the active connections and associated resources. This can lead
 to a Denial of Service scenario where there are no enough resources left to
 process good requests.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.4.39-3+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your jetty9 packages.
