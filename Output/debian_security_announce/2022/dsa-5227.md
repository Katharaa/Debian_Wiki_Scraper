DSA-5227-1 libgoogle-gson-java -- security update
-------------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Sep 2022
Affected Packages:

[libgoogle-gson-java](https://packages.debian.org/src:libgoogle-gson-java)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1010670](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1010670).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-25647](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-25647).  

More information:

It was discovered that Gson, a Java library that can be used to convert Java
Objects into their JSON representations and vice versa, was vulnerable to a deserialization flaw. An application would de-serialize untrusted data without
sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the
attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution. This can lead to a
denial of service or even the execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.6-1+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libgoogle-gson-java packages.
