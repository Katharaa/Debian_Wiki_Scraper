-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
20 Jan 2022
Affected Packages:

[flatpak](https://packages.debian.org/src:flatpak)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-43860](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43860), [CVE-2022-21682](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-21682).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Flatpak, an application
deployment framework for desktop apps.


* [CVE-2021-43860](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43860)
Ryan Gonzalez discovered that Flatpak didn't properly validate
 that the permissions displayed to the user for an app at install
 time match the actual permissions granted to the app at
 runtime. Malicious apps could therefore grant themselves
 permissions without the consent of the user.
* [CVE-2022-21682](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-21682)
Flatpak didn't always prevent a malicious flatpak-builder user
 from writing to the local filesystem.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.10.7-0+deb11u1.


Please note that flatpak-builder also needed an update for
compatibility, and is now at version 1.0.12-1+deb11u1 in bullseye.


We recommend that you upgrade your flatpak and flatpak-builder
packages.
