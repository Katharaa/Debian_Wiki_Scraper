More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They allowed remote attackers to perform SQL injection, create
open redirects, bypass authorization access, or perform Cross-Site
Request Forgery (CSRF) or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.7.8+dfsg1-0+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.
