More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server
implementation.


* [CVE-2022-2795](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2795)
Yehuda Afek, Anat Bremler-Barr and Shani Stajnrod discovered that a
 flaw in the resolver code can cause named to spend excessive amounts
 of time on processing large delegations, significantly degrade
 resolver performance and result in denial of service.
* [CVE-2022-3080](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3080)
Maksym Odinintsev discovered that the resolver can crash when stale
 cache and stale answers are enabled with a zero
 stale-answer-timeout. A remote attacker can take advantage of this
 flaw to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via specially
 crafted queries to the resolver.
* [CVE-2022-38177](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-38177)
It was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the ECDSA
 algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker
 can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources,
 resulting in a denial of service.
* [CVE-2022-38178](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-38178)
It was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the EdDSA
 algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker
 can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources,
 resulting in a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.16.33-1~deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
