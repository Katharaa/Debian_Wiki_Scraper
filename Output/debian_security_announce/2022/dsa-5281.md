Affected Packages:

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-41741](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-41741), [CVE-2022-41742](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-41742).  

More information:

It was discovered that parsing errors in the mp4 module of Nginx, a
high-performance web and reverse proxy server, could result in denial
of service, memory disclosure or potentially the execution of arbitrary
code when processing a malformed mp4 file.


This module is only enabled in the nginx-extras binary package.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.18.0-6.1+deb11u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.
