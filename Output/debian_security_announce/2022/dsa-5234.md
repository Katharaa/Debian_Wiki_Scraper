Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-20001](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-20001).  

More information:

An arbitrary code execution vulnerability was disovered in fish, a
command line shell. When using the default configuraton of fish,
changing to a directory automatically ran `git` commands in order to
display information about the current repository in the prompt. Such
repositories can contain per-repository configuration that change the
behavior of git, including running arbitrary commands.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.2-3+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your fish packages.
