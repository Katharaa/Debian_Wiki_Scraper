----------------------------------------



Date Reported:

More information:

The Qualys Research Labs discovered two vulnerabilities in util-linux's
libmount. These flaws allow an unprivileged user to unmount other users'
filesystems that are either world-writable themselves or mounted in a
world-writable directory
([CVE-2021-3996](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3996)), or to unmount FUSE filesystems that belong to certain other
users
([CVE-2021-3995](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3995)).


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.36.1-8+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your util-linux packages.
