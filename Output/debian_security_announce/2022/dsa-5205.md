More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix.


* [CVE-2022-2031](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2031)
Luke Howard reported that Samba AD users can bypass certain
 restrictions associated with changing passwords. A user who has been
 requested to change their password can exploit this to obtain and
 use tickets to other services.
* [CVE-2022-32742](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32742)
Luca Moro reported that a SMB1 client with write access to a share
 can cause server memory content to be leaked.
* [CVE-2022-32744](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32744)
Joseph Sutton reported that Samba AD users can forge password change
 requests for any user, resulting in privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-32745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32745)
Joseph Sutton reported that Samba AD users can crash the server
 process with a specially crafted LDAP add or modify request.
* [CVE-2022-32746](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32746)
Joseph Sutton and Andrew Bartlett reported that Samba AD users can
 cause a use-after-free in the server process with a specially
 crafted LDAP add or modify request.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.13.13+dfsg-1~deb11u5. The fix for
[CVE-2022-32745](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32745)
required an update to ldb 2:2.2.3-2~deb11u2 to correct the defect.


We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
