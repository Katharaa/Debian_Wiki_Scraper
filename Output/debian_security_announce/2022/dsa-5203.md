--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
08 Aug 2022
Affected Packages:

[gnutls28](https://packages.debian.org/src:gnutls28)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-2509](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2509).  

More information:

Jaak Ristioja discovered a double-free vulnerability in GnuTLS, a
library implementing the TLS and SSL protocols, during verification of
pkcs7 signatures. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
cause an application using the GnuTLS library to crash (denial of
service), or potentially, to execute arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.1-5+deb11u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages.
