More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2021-43976](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-43976)
Zekun Shen and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered a flaw in the
 mwifiex\_usb\_recv() function of the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB Driver. An
 attacker able to connect a crafted USB device can take advantage of
 this flaw to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2022-0330](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0330)
Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered a missing GPU TLB flush in the
 i915 driver, resulting in denial of service or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-0435](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0435)
Samuel Page and Eric Dumazet reported a stack overflow in the
 networking module for the Transparent Inter-Process Communication
 (TIPC) protocol, resulting in denial of service or potentially the
 execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2022-0516](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0516)
It was discovered that an insufficient check in the KVM subsystem
 for s390x could allow unauthorized memory read or write access.
* [CVE-2022-0847](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0847)
Max Kellermann discovered a flaw in the handling of pipe buffer
 flags. An attacker can take advantage of this flaw for local
 privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-22942](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-22942)
It was discovered that wrong file descriptor handling in the
 VMware Virtual GPU driver (vmwgfx) could result in information leak
 or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2022-24448](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24448)
Lyu Tao reported a flaw in the NFS implementation in the Linux
 kernel when handling requests to open a directory on a regular file,
 which could result in a information leak.
* [CVE-2022-24959](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24959)
A memory leak was discovered in the yam\_siocdevprivate() function of
 the YAM driver for AX.25, which could result in denial of service.
* [CVE-2022-25258](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-25258)
Szymon Heidrich reported the USB Gadget subsystem lacks certain
 validation of interface OS descriptor requests, resulting in memory
 corruption.
* [CVE-2022-25375](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-25375)
Szymon Heidrich reported that the RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation
 of the size of the RNDIS\_MSG\_SET command, resulting in information
 leak from kernel memory.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.92-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
