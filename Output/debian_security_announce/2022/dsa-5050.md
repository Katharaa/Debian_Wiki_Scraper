More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2021-4155](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4155)
Kirill Tkhai discovered a data leak in the way the XFS\_IOC\_ALLOCSP
 IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for a size increase of files
 with unaligned size. A local attacker can take advantage of this
 flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem.
* [CVE-2021-28711](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28711), [CVE-2021-28712](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28712), [CVE-2021-28713](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28713) (XSA-391)
 Juergen Gross reported that malicious PV backends can cause a denial
 of service to guests being serviced by those backends via high
 frequency events, even if those backends are running in a less
 privileged environment.
* [CVE-2021-28714](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28714), [CVE-2021-28715](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28715) (XSA-392)
 Juergen Gross discovered that Xen guests can force the Linux
 netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory, resulting in
 denial of service.
* [CVE-2021-39685](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-39685)
Szymon Heidrich discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
 USB gadget subsystem, resulting in information disclosure, denial of
 service or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2021-45095](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45095)
It was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) driver
 has a reference count leak in the pep\_sock\_accept() function.
* [CVE-2021-45469](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45469)
Wenqing Liu reported an out-of-bounds memory access in the f2fs
 implementation if an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. An
 attacker able to mount a specially crafted image can take advantage
 of this flaw for denial of service.
* [CVE-2021-45480](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45480)
A memory leak flaw was discovered in the \_\_rds\_conn\_create()
 function in the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol subsystem.
* [CVE-2022-0185](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0185)
William Liu, Jamie Hill-Daniel, Isaac Badipe, Alec Petridis, Hrvoje
 Misetic and Philip Papurt discovered a heap-based buffer overflow
 flaw in the legacy\_parse\_param function in the Filesystem Context
 functionality, allowing an local user (with CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN capability
 in the current namespace) to escalate privileges.
* [CVE-2022-23222](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23222)
tr3e discovered that the BPF verifier does not properly restrict
 several \*\_OR\_NULL pointer types allowing these types to do pointer
 arithmetic. A local user with the ability to call bpf(), can take
 advantage of this flaw to excalate privileges. Unprivileged calls to
 bpf() are disabled by default in Debian, mitigating this flaw.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.92-1. This version includes changes which were aimed to
land in the next Debian bullseye point release.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
