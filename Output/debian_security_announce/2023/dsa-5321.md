Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-5321-1 sudo -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Jan 2023
Affected Packages:

[sudo](https://packages.debian.org/src:sudo)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-22809](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-22809).  

More information:

Matthieu Barjole and Victor Cutillas discovered that sudoedit in sudo, a
program designed to provide limited super user privileges to specific
users, does not properly handle '--' to separate the editor and
arguments from files to edit. A local user permitted to edit certain
files can take advantage of this flaw to edit a file not permitted by
the security policy, resulting in privilege escalation.


Details can be found in the upstream advisory at
<https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/sudoedit_any/> .


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.5p2-3+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.
