More information:

Multiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in snort, a flexible Network
Intrusion Detection System, which could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or bypass filtering
technology on an affected device and ex-filtrate data from a compromised host.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.20-0+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your snort packages.
