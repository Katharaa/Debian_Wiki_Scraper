Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1034720](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1034720).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-0464](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0464), [CVE-2023-0465](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0465), [CVE-2023-0466](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0466), [CVE-2023-2650](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2650).  

More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure
Sockets Layer toolkit.


* [CVE-2023-0464](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0464)
David Benjamin reported a flaw related to the verification of X.509
 certificate chains that include policy constraints, which may result
 in denial of service.
* [CVE-2023-0465](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0465)
David Benjamin reported that invalid certificate policies in leaf
 certificates are silently ignored. A malicious CA could take
 advantage of this flaw to deliberately assert invalid certificate
 policies in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate
 altogether.
* [CVE-2023-0466](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0466)
David Benjamin discovered that the implementation of the
 X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy() function does not enable the check
 which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass
 the certificate verification (contrary to its documentation).
* [CVE-2023-2650](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2650)
It was discovered that processing malformed ASN.1 object identifiers
 or data may result in denial of service.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.1n-0+deb11u5.


We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
