More information:

Multiple issues were found in Git, a distributed revision control system.
An attacker may trigger remote code execution, cause local users into
executing arbitrary commands, leak information from the local filesystem,
and bypass restricted shell.


This update includes two changes of behavior that may affect certain setup:
 - It stops when directory traversal changes ownership from the current
 user while looking for a top-level git directory, a user could make an
 exception by using the new safe.directory configuration.
 - The default of protocol.file.allow has been changed from "always" to
 "user".


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.30.2-1+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.
