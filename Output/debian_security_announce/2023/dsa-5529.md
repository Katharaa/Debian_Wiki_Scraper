Francois Diakhate discovered that several race conditions in file
processing of the Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM),
a cluster resource management and job scheduling system, could result
in denial of service by overwriting arbitrary files.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in
version 22.05.8-4+deb12u1. In addition slurm-wlm-contrib also needed to
be patched in version 22.05.8-4+deb12u1.
