--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
05 Apr 2023
Affected Packages:

[cairosvg](https://packages.debian.org/src:cairosvg)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1033295](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1033295).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-27586](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-27586).  

More information:

It was reported that cairosvg, a SVG converter based on Cairo, can send
requests to external hosts when processing specially crafted SVG files
with external file resource loading. An attacker can take advantage of
this flaw to perform a server-side request forgery or denial of service.
Fetching of external files is disabled by default with this update.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.0-1.1+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your cairosvg packages.
