-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
05 Apr 2023
Affected Packages:

[ghostscript](https://packages.debian.org/src:ghostscript)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1033757](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1033757).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-28879](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-28879).  

More information:

It was discovered that Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF interpreter,
is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability in the (T)BCP encoding
filters, which could result in the execution of arbitrary code if
malformed document files are processed (despite the -dSAFER sandbox
being enabled).


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.53.3~dfsg-7+deb11u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.
