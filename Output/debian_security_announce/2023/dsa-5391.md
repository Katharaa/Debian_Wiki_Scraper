Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libxml2, a library providing
support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files.


* [CVE-2023-28484](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-28484)
A NULL pointer dereference flaw when parsing invalid XML schemas may
 result in denial of service.
* [CVE-2023-29469](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-29469)
It was reported that when hashing empty strings which aren't
 null-terminated, xmlDictComputeFastKey could produce inconsistent
 results, which may lead to various logic or memory errors.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.
