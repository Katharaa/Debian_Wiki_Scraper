More information:

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine.


* [CVE-2022-42252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42252)
Apache Tomcat was configured to ignore invalid HTTP headers via setting
 rejectIllegalHeader to false. Tomcat did not reject a request containing an
 invalid Content-Length header making a request smuggling attack possible if
 Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that also failed to reject the
 request with the invalid header.
* [CVE-2022-45143](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-45143)
The JsonErrorReportValve in Apache Tomcat did not escape the type, message
 or description values. In some circumstances these are constructed from
 user provided data and it was therefore possible for users to supply values
 that invalidated or manipulated the JSON output.
* [CVE-2023-28708](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-28708)
When using the RemoteIpFilter with requests received from a reverse proxy
 via HTTP that include the X-Forwarded-Proto header set to https, session
 cookies created by Apache Tomcat did not include the secure attribute. This
 could result in the user agent transmitting the session cookie over an
 insecure channel.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.0.43-2~deb11u6.


We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat9 packages.
