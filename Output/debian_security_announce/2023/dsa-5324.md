More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2022-2873](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2873)
Zheyu Ma discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in the
 Intel iSMT SMBus 2.0 host controller driver may result in denial of
 service (system crash).
* [CVE-2022-3545](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3545)
It was discovered that the Netronome Flow Processor (NFP) driver
 contained a use-after-free flaw in area\_cache\_get(), which may
 result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2022-3623](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3623)
A race condition when looking up a CONT-PTE/PMD size hugetlb page
 may result in denial of service or an information leak.
* [CVE-2022-4696](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-4696)
A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the io\_uring
 subsystem.
* [CVE-2022-36280](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-36280)
An out-of-bounds memory write vulnerability was discovered in the
 vmwgfx driver, which may allow a local unprivileged user to cause a
 denial of service (system crash).
* [CVE-2022-41218](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-41218)
Hyunwoo Kim reported a use-after-free flaw in the Media DVB core
 subsystem caused by refcount races, which may allow a local user to
 cause a denial of service or escalate privileges.
* [CVE-2022-45934](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-45934)
An integer overflow in l2cap\_config\_req() in the Bluetooth subsystem
 was discovered, which may allow a physically proximate attacker to
 cause a denial of service (system crash).
* [CVE-2022-47929](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-47929)
Frederick Lawler reported a NULL pointer dereference in the traffic
 control subsystem allowing an unprivileged user to cause a denial of
 service by setting up a specially crafted traffic control
 configuration.
* [CVE-2023-0179](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0179)
Davide Ornaghi discovered incorrect arithmetics when fetching VLAN
 header bits in the netfilter subsystem, allowing a local user to
 leak stack and heap addresses or potentially local privilege
 escalation to root.
* [CVE-2023-0266](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0266)
A use-after-free flaw in the sound subsystem due to missing locking
 may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2023-0394](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0394)
Kyle Zeng discovered a NULL pointer dereference flaw in
 rawv6\_push\_pending\_frames() in the network subsystem allowing a
 local user to cause a denial of service (system crash).
* [CVE-2023-23454](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-23454)
Kyle Zeng reported that the Class Based Queueing (CBQ) network
 scheduler was prone to denial of service due to interpreting
 classification results before checking the classification
 return code.
* [CVE-2023-23455](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-23455)
Kyle Zeng reported that the ATM Virtual Circuits (ATM) network
 scheduler was prone to a denial of service due to interpreting
 classification results before checking the classification
 return code.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.162-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
