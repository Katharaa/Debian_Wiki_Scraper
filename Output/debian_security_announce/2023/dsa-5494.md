More information:

Several NULL pointer dereference flaws were discovered in Mutt, a

result in denial of service (application crash) when viewing a specially
crafted email or when composing from a specially crafted draft message.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.0.5-4.1+deb11u3.
