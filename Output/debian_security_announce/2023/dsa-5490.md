More information:

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in aom, the AV1 Video
Codec Library. Buffer overflows, use-after-free and NULL pointer dereferences
may cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact if a malformed
multimedia file is processed.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0.0.errata1-3+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your aom packages.
