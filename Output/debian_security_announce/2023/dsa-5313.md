DSA-5313-1 hsqldb -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
11 Jan 2023
Affected Packages:

[hsqldb](https://packages.debian.org/src:hsqldb)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1023573](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1023573).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-41853](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-41853).  

More information:

It was found that those using java.sql.Statement or java.sql.PreparedStatement
in hsqldb, a Java SQL database, to process untrusted input may be vulnerable to
a remote code execution attack. By default it is allowed to call any static
method of any Java class in the classpath resulting in code execution. The
issue can be prevented by updating to 2.5.1-1+deb11u1 or by setting the system
property hsqldb.method\_class\_names to classes which are allowed to be called.
For example, System.setProperty("hsqldb.method\_class\_names","abc") or Java
argument -Dhsqldb.method\_class\_names="abc" can be used. From version
2.5.1-1+deb11u1 all classes by default are not accessible except those in
java.lang.Math and need to be manually enabled.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.1-1+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your hsqldb packages.
