More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2023-1206](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-1206)
It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
 force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which may
 result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost of
 lookups, increased CPU utilization).
* [CVE-2023-1989](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-1989)
Zheng Wang reported a race condition in the btsdio Bluetooth adapter
 driver that can lead to a use-after-free. An attacker able to insert
 and remove SDIO devices can use this to cause a denial of service
 (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary code in
 the kernel.
* [CVE-2023-2430](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2430)
Xingyuan Mo discovered that the io\_uring subsystem did not properly
 handle locking when the target ring is configured with IOPOLL, which
 may result in denial of service.
* [CVE-2023-2898](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2898)
It was discovered that missing sanitising in the f2fs file
 system may result in denial of service if a malformed file
 system is accessed.

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write in the traffic control
 subsystem for the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler (QFQ) may result in
 denial of service or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2023-3772](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3772)

 [CVE-2023-4207](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4207),
 [CVE-2023-4208](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4208)
It was discovered that a use-after-free in the cls\_fw, cls\_u32 and
 cls\_route network classifiers may result in denial of service or
 potential local privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2023-3777](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3777)
Kevin Rich discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter when flushing
 table rules, which may result in local privilege escalation for a
 user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability in any user or network
 namespace.
* [CVE-2023-3863](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3863)
It was discovered that a use-after-free in the NFC implementation
 may result in denial of service, an information leak or potential
 local privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2023-4004](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4004)
It was discovered that a use-after-free in Netfilter's
 implementation of PIPAPO (PIle PAcket POlicies) may result in denial
 of service or potential local privilege escalation for a user with
 the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace.
* [CVE-2023-4015](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4015)
Kevin Rich discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter when handling
 bound chain deactivation in certain circumstances, may result in
 denial of service or potential local privilege escalation for a user
 with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace.
* [CVE-2023-4132](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4132)
A use-after-free in the driver for Siano SMS1xxx based MDTV
 receivers may result in local denial of service.
* [CVE-2023-4147](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4147)
Kevin Rich discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter when adding a
 rule with NFTA\_RULE\_CHAIN\_ID, which may result in local privilege
 escalation for a user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability in any user
 or network namespace.
* [CVE-2023-4155](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4155)
Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the KVM subsystem allowing a KVM
 guest using EV-ES or SEV-SNP to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2023-4194](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4194)
A type confusion in the implementation of TUN/TAP network devices
 may allow a local user to bypass network filters.
* [CVE-2023-4273](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4273)
Maxim Suhanov discovered a stack overflow in the exFAT driver, which
 may result in local denial of service via a malformed file system.
* [CVE-2023-4569](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4569)
lonial con discovered flaw in the Netfilter subsystem, which may
 allow a local attacker to cause a double-deactivations of catchall
 elements, which results in a memory leak.
* [CVE-2023-4622](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4622)

Jana Hofmann, Emanuele Vannacci, Cedric Fournet, Boris Koepf and
 Oleksii Oleksenko discovered that on some AMD CPUs with the Zen1
 micro architecture an integer division by zero may leave stale
 quotient data from a previous division, resulting in a potential
 leak of sensitive data.
* [CVE-2023-34319](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-34319)
Ross Lagerwall discovered a buffer overrun in Xen's netback driver
 which may allow a Xen guest to cause denial of service to the
 virtualisation host my sending malformed packets.
* [CVE-2023-40283](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-40283)
A use-after-free was discovered in Bluetooth L2CAP socket handling.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.1.52-1. This update is released without armel builds. Changes
in the new stable series import cause a substantial increase of the
compressed image for marvell flavour. This issue will be addressed in a
future linux update.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
