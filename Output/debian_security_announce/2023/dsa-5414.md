DSA-5414-1 docker-registry -- security update
---------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
27 May 2023
Affected Packages:

[docker-registry](https://packages.debian.org/src:docker-registry)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1035956](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1035956).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-2253](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2253).  

More information:

Jose Gomez discovered that the Catalog API endpoint in the Docker
registry implementation did not sufficiently enforce limits, which
could result in denial of service.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.1+ds2-7+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your docker-registry packages.
