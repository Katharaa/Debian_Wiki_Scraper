It was discovered that Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF interpreter,
does not properly handle permission validation for pipe devices, which
could result in the execution of arbitrary commands if malformed
document files are processed.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed
in version 9.53.3~dfsg-7+deb11u5.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.
