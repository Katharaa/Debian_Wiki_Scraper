DSA-5424-1 php7.4 -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
13 Jun 2023
Affected Packages:

[php7.4](https://packages.debian.org/src:php7.4)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
No other external database security references currently available.
More information:

It was discovered that PHP's implementation of SOAP HTTP Digest
authentication performed insufficient error validation, which may result
in a stack information leak or use of weak randomness.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed
in version 7.4.33-1+deb11u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your php7.4 packages.


For the detailed security status of php7.4 please refer to
