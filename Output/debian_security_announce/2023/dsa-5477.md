Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1041043](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1041043).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-2127](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2127), [CVE-2023-3347](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3347), [CVE-2023-34966](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-34966), [CVE-2023-34967](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-34967), [CVE-2023-34968](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-34968).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, which could result
in information disclosure, denial of service or insufficient enforcement
of security-relevant config directives.


The version of Samba in the oldstable distribution (bullseye) cannot be
fully supported further: If you are using Samba as a domain controller
you should either upgrade to the stable distribution or if that's not
an immediate option consider to migrate to Samba from bullseye-backports
(which will be kept updated to the version in stable). Operating Samba
as a file/print server will continue to be supported, a separate DSA
will provide an update along with documentation about the scope of continued
support.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.17.10+dfsg-0+deb12u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
