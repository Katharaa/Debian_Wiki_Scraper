More information:

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in mosquitto, a MQTT
compatible message broker, which may be abused for a denial of service attack.


* [CVE-2021-34434](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-34434)
In Eclipse Mosquitto when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability
 for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable
 client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not
 revoked.
* [CVE-2023-0809](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0809)
Fix excessive memory being allocated based on malicious initial packets
 that are not CONNECT packets.
* [CVE-2023-3592](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3592)
Fix memory leak when clients send v5 CONNECT packets with a will message
 that contains invalid property types.
* [CVE-2023-28366](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-28366)
The broker in Eclipse Mosquitto has a memory leak that can be abused
 remotely when a client sends many QoS 2 messages with duplicate message
 IDs, and fails to respond to PUBREC commands. This occurs because of
 mishandling of EAGAIN from the libc send function.
Additionally [CVE-2021-41039](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-41039) has been fixed for Debian 11 Bullseye.

* [CVE-2021-41039](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-41039)
An MQTT v5 client connecting with a large number of user-property
 properties could cause excessive CPU usage, leading to a loss of
 performance and possible denial of service.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.0.11-1+deb11u1.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.11-1.2+deb12u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your mosquitto packages.
