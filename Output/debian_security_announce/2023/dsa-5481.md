More information:

Multipe security issues were discovered in Fast DDS, a C++ implementation
of the DDS (Data Distribution Service), which might result in denial of
service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code when processing
malformed RTPS packets.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.1.0+ds-9+deb11u1.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.1+ds-1+deb12u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your fastdds packages.
