More information:

Multiple security issues were discovered in Netatalk, an implementation
of the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) for offering file service (mainly) to
macOS clients, which may result in the execution of arbitrary code or
information disclosure.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.1.12~ds-8+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your netatalk packages.
