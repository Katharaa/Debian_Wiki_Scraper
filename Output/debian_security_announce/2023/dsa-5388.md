Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-0836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0836).  

More information:

It was reported that HAProxy, a fast and reliable load balancing reverse
proxy, does not properly initialize connection buffers when encoding the
FCGI\_BEGIN\_REQUEST record. A remote attacker can take advantage of this
flaw to cause an information leak.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.9-2+deb11u5.


We recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.
