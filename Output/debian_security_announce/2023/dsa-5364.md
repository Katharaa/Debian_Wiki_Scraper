In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-25147](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-25147).  

More information:

Ronald Crane discovered that missing input sanitizing in the apr\_base64
functions of apr-util, the Apache Portable Runtime utility library, may
result in denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary
