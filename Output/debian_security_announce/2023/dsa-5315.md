DSA-5315-1 libxstream-java -- security update
---------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
11 Jan 2023
Affected Packages:

[libxstream-java](https://packages.debian.org/src:libxstream-java)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1027754](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1027754).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-41966](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-41966).  

More information:

XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to
1.4.15-3+deb11u2 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with
a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation
of the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for
collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack
overflow. This update handles the stack overflow and raises an
InputManipulationException instead.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.15-3+deb11u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your libxstream-java packages.
