DSA-5438-1 asterisk -- security update
--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
22 Jun 2023
Affected Packages:

[asterisk](https://packages.debian.org/src:asterisk)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1036697](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1036697).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-27585](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-27585).  

More information:

A flaw was found in Asterisk, an Open Source Private Branch Exchange. A
buffer overflow vulnerability affects users that use PJSIP DNS resolver.
This vulnerability is related to
[CVE-2022-24793](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24793).
The difference is that this issue is in parsing the query record
`parse\_query()`, while the issue in
[CVE-2022-24793](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24793)
is in `parse\_rr()`. A workaround is to disable DNS resolution in PJSIP config
(by setting `nameserver\_count` to zero) or use an external resolver
implementation instead.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.
