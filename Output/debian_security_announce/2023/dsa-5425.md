DSA-5425-1 php8.2 -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
13 Jun 2023
Affected Packages:

[php8.2](https://packages.debian.org/src:php8.2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
No other external database security references currently available.
More information:

It was discovered that PHP's implementation of SOAP HTTP Digest
authentication performed insufficient error validation, which may result
in a stack information leak or use of weak randomness.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.2.7-1~deb12u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your php8.2 packages.
