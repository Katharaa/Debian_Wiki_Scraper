Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird, which could

Debian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the
102.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 115.x series.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:115.3.1-1~deb11u1.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:115.3.1-1~deb12u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your thunderbird packages.
