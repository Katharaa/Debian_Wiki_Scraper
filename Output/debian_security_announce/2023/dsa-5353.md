Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-0767](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0767).  

More information:

Christian Holler discovered that incorrect handling of PKCS 12 Safe Bag
attributes in nss, the Mozilla Network Security Service library, may
result in execution of arbitrary code if a specially crafted PKCS 12
certificate bundle is processed.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.61-1+deb11u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.
