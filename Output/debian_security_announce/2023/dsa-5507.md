More information:

Multiple security vulnerabilities were found in Jetty, a Java based web server
and servlet engine.


The org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI class has been deprecated. It is potentially
unsafe to use it. The upstream developers of Jetty recommend to use Fast CGI
instead. See also [CVE-2023-36479](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-36479).


* [CVE-2023-26048](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-26048)
In affected versions servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with
 `@MultipartConfig`) that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or
 `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the
 client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no
 filename and very large content. This happens even with the default
 settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part
 content to disk.
* [CVE-2023-26049](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-26049)
Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle
 cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by
 tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism.
* [CVE-2023-40167](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-40167)
Prior to this version Jetty accepted the `+` character proceeding the
 content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field. This is more permissive than
 allowed by the RFC and other servers routinely reject such requests with
 400 responses. There is no known exploit scenario, but it is conceivable
 that request smuggling could result if jetty is used in combination with a
 server that does not close the connection after sending such a 400
 response.
* [CVE-2023-36479](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-36479)
Users of the CgiServlet with a very specific command structure may have the
 wrong command executed. If a user sends a request to a
 org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI Servlet for a binary with a space in its
 name, the servlet will escape the command by wrapping it in quotation
 marks. This wrapped command, plus an optional command prefix, will then be
 executed through a call to Runtime.exec. If the original binary name
 provided by the user contains a quotation mark followed by a space, the
 resulting command line will contain multiple tokens instead of one.
* [CVE-2023-41900](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-41900)
Jetty is vulnerable to weak authentication. If a Jetty
 `OpenIdAuthenticator` uses the optional nested `LoginService`, and that
 `LoginService` decides to revoke an already authenticated user, then the
 current request will still treat the user as authenticated. The
 authentication is then cleared from the session and subsequent requests
 will not be treated as authenticated. So a request on a previously
 authenticated session could be allowed to bypass authentication after it
 had been rejected by the `LoginService`. This impacts usages of the
 jetty-openid which have configured a nested `LoginService` and where that
 `LoginService` is capable of rejecting previously authenticated users.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 9.4.39-3+deb11u2.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.4.50-4+deb12u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your jetty9 packages.
