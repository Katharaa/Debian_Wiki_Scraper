Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-43441](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-43441).  

More information:

Dave McDaniel discovered that the SQLite3 bindings for Node.js were
susceptible to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code if a binding
parameter is a crafted object.

version 5.0.0+ds1-1+deb11u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your node-sqlite3 packages.
