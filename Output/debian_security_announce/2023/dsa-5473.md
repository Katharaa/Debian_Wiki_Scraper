-------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1040597](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1040597).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-33466](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-33466).  

More information:

It was discovered that authenticated API users of Orthanc, a DICOM server
for medical imaging, could overwrite arbitrary files and in some setups
execute arbitrary code.


This update backports the option RestApiWriteToFileSystemEnabled,
setting it to true in /etc/orthanc/orthanc.json restores the previous
behaviour.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.9.2+really1.9.1+dfsg-1+deb11u1.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.1+dfsg-2+deb12u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your orthanc packages.
