In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-25076](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-25076).  

More information:

An issue has been found in sniproxy, a transparent TLS and HTTP layer 4
proxy with SNI support. Due to bad handling of wildcard backend hosts,
a crafted HTTP or TLS packet might lead to remote arbitrary code
execution.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.0-2+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your sniproxy packages.
