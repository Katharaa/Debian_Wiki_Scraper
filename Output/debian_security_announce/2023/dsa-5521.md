Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-28709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-28709), [CVE-2023-41080](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-41080), [CVE-2023-42795](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-42795), [CVE-2023-44487](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-44487), [CVE-2023-45648](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-45648).  

More information:

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine.


* [CVE-2023-28709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-28709)
Denial of Service. If non-default HTTP connector settings were used such
 that the maxParameterCount could be reached using query string parameters
 and a request was submitted that supplied exactly maxParameterCount
 parameters in the query string, the limit for uploaded request parts could
 be bypassed with the potential for a denial of service to occur.
* [CVE-2023-41080](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-41080)
Open redirect. If the ROOT (default) web application is configured to use
 FORM authentication then it is possible that a specially crafted URL could
 be used to trigger a redirect to an URL of the attackers choice.
* [CVE-2023-42795](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-42795)
Information Disclosure. When recycling various internal objects, including
 the request and the response, prior to re-use by the next request/response,
 an error could cause Tomcat to skip some parts of the recycling process
 leading to information leaking from the current request/response to the
 next.
* [CVE-2023-44487](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-44487)
DoS caused by HTTP/2 frame overhead (Rapid Reset Attack)
* [CVE-2023-45648](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-45648)
Request smuggling. Tomcat did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A
 specially crafted, invalid trailer header could cause Tomcat to treat a
 single request as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request
 smuggling when behind a reverse proxy.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.1.6-1+deb12u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat10 packages.
