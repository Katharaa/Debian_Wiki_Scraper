More information:

Several flaws were found in tiffcrop, a program distributed by tiff, the Tag
Image File Format (TIFF) library and tools. A specially crafted tiff file
can lead to an out-of-bounds write or read resulting in a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.0-1+deb11u4.


We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.
