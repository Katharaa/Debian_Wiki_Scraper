DSA-5419-1 c-ares -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
07 Jun 2023
Affected Packages:

[c-ares](https://packages.debian.org/src:c-ares)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-31130](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31130), [CVE-2023-32067](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-32067).  

More information:

Two vunerabilities were discovered in c-ares, an asynchronous name
resolver library:


* [CVE-2023-31130](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31130)
ares\_inet\_net\_pton() is found to be vulnerable to a buffer underflow
 for certain ipv6 addresses, in particular "0::00:00:00/2" was found
 to cause an issue. c-ares only uses this function internally for
 configuration purposes, however external usage for other purposes may
 cause more severe issues.
* [CVE-2023-32067](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-32067)
Target resolver may erroneously interprets a malformed UDP packet
 with a lenght of 0 as a graceful shutdown of the connection, which
 could cause a denial of service.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.1-1+deb11u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your c-ares packages.
