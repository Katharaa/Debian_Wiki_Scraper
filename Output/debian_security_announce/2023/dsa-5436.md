-----------------------------------------

21 Jun 2023
Affected Packages:

[hsqldb1.8.0](https://packages.debian.org/src:hsqldb1.8.0)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-1183](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-1183).  

More information:

Gregor Kopf of Secfault Security GmbH discovered that HSQLDB, a Java SQL
database engine, allowed the execution of spurious scripting commands in
.script and .log files. Hsqldb supports a SCRIPT keyword which is normally
used to record the commands input by the database admin to output such a
script. In combination with LibreOffice, an attacker could craft an odb
containing a "database/script" file which itself contained a SCRIPT command
where the contents of the file could be written to a new file whose location
was determined by the attacker.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.8.0.10+dfsg-10+deb11u1.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.0.10+dfsg-11+deb12u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your hsqldb1.8.0 packages.
