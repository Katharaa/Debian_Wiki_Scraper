More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2022-4269](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-4269)
William Zhao discovered that a flaw in the Traffic Control (TC)
 subsystem when using a specific networking configuration
 (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action mirred),
 may allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service
 (triggering a CPU soft lockup).
* [CVE-2022-39189](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39189)
Jann Horn discovered that TLB flush operations are mishandled in the
 KVM subsystem in certain KVM\_VCPU\_PREEMPTED situations, which may
 allow an unprivileged guest user to compromise the guest kernel.
* [CVE-2023-1206](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-1206)
It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
 force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which may
 result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost of
 lookups, increased CPU utilization).
* [CVE-2023-1380](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-1380)
Jisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac Wi-Fi
 driver. On systems using this driver, a local user could exploit
 this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2023-2002](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2002)
Ruiahn Li reported an incorrect permissions check in the Bluetooth
 subsystem. A local user could exploit this to reconfigure local
 Bluetooth interfaces, resulting in information leaks, spoofing, or
 denial of service (loss of connection).
* [CVE-2023-2007](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2007)
Lucas Leong and Reno Robert discovered a time-of-check-to-time-of-use
 flaw in the dpt\_i2o SCSI controller driver. A local user with
 access to a SCSI device using this driver could exploit this for
 privilege escalation.


This flaw has been mitigated by removing support for the I2OUSRCMD
 operation.
* [CVE-2023-2124](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2124)
Kyle Zeng, Akshay Ajayan and Fish Wang discovered that missing
 metadata validation may result in denial of service or potential
 privilege escalation if a corrupted XFS disk image is mounted.
* [CVE-2023-2269](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2269)
Zheng Zhang reported that improper handling of locking in the device
 mapper implementation may result in denial of service.
* [CVE-2023-2898](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2898)
It was discovered that missing sanitising in the f2fs file
 system may result in denial of service if a malformed file
 system is accessed.
* [CVE-2023-3090](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3090)
It was discovered that missing initialization in ipvlan networking
 may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, resulting in
 denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2023-3111](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3111)
The TOTE Robot tool found a flaw in the Btrfs filesystem driver that
 can lead to a use-after-free. It's unclear whether an unprivileged
 user can exploit this.
* [CVE-2023-3212](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3212)
Yang Lan discovered that missing validation in the GFS2 filesystem
 could result in denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference when
 mounting a malformed GFS2 filesystem.
* [CVE-2023-3268](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3268)
It was discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access in relayfs
 could result in denial of service or an information leak.
* [CVE-2023-3338](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3338)
Davide Ornaghi discovered a flaw in the DECnet protocol implementation
 which could lead to a null pointer dereference or use-after-free. A
 local user can exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
 memory corruption) and probably for privilege escalation.


This flaw has been mitigated by removing the DECnet protocol
 implementation.
* [CVE-2023-3389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3389)
Querijn Voet discovered a use-after-free in the io\_uring subsystem,
 which may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2023-3611](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3611)
It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write in the traffic control
 subsystem for the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler (QFQ) may result in
 denial of service or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2023-3609](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3609),
 [CVE-2023-3776](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3776),
 [CVE-2023-4128](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4128)
It was discovered that a use-after-free in the cls\_fw, cls\_u32,
 cls\_route and network classifiers may result in denial of service or
 potential local privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2023-3863](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3863)
It was discovered that a use-after-free in the NFC implementation
 may result in denial of service, an information leak or potential
 local privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2023-4004](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4004)
It was discovered that a use-after-free in Netfilter's
 implementation of PIPAPO (PIle PAcket POlicies) may result in denial
 of service or potential local privilege escalation for a user with
 the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace.
* [CVE-2023-4132](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4132)
A use-after-free in the driver for Siano SMS1xxx based MDTV
 receivers may result in local denial of service.
* [CVE-2023-4147](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4147)
Kevin Rich discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter when adding a
 rule with NFTA\_RULE\_CHAIN\_ID, which may result in local privilege
 escalation for a user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability in any user
 or network namespace.
* [CVE-2023-4194](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4194)
A type confusion in the implementation of TUN/TAP network devices
 may allow a local user to bypass network filters.
* [CVE-2023-4273](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4273)
Maxim Suhanov discovered a stack overflow in the exFAT driver, which
 may result in local denial of service via a malformed file system.
* [CVE-2023-20588](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-20588)
Jana Hofmann, Emanuele Vannacci, Cedric Fournet, Boris Koepf and
 Oleksii Oleksenko discovered that on some AMD CPUs with the Zen1
 micro architecture an integer division by zero may leave stale
 quotient data from a previous division, resulting in a potential
 leak of sensitive data.
* [CVE-2023-21255](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-21255)
A use-after-free was discovered in the Android binder driver, which
 may result in local privilege escalation on systems where the binder
 driver is loaded.
* [CVE-2023-21400](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-21400)
Ye Zhang and Nicolas Wu discovered a double-free in the io\_uring
 subsystem, which may result in denial of service or privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2023-31084](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31084)
It was discovered that the DVB Core driver does not properly handle
 locking of certain events, allowing a local user to cause a denial
 of service.
* [CVE-2023-34319](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-34319)

 which may allow a Xen guest to cause denial of service to the
 virtualisation host by sending malformed packets.
* [CVE-2023-35788](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-35788)
Hangyu Hua discovered that an off-by-one in the Flower traffic
 classifier may result in local denial of service or the execution of
 privilege escalation.

A use-after-free was discovered in Bluetooth L2CAP socket handling.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.10.191-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
