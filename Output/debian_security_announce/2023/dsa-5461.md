In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-3390](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3390), [CVE-2023-3610](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3610), [CVE-2023-20593](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-20593).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2023-3390](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3390)
A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by incorrect
 error path handling may result in denial of service or privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2023-3610](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3610)
A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by incorrect
 refcount handling on the table and chain destroy path may result in
 denial of service or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2023-20593](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-20593)
Tavis Ormandy discovered that under specific microarchitectural
 circumstances, a vector register in AMD Zen 2 CPUs may not be
 written to 0 correctly. This flaw allows an attacker to leak
 sensitive information across concurrent processes, hyper threads
 and virtualized guests.

This issue can also be mitigated by a microcode update through the
 amd64-microcode package or a system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update.
 However, the initial microcode release by AMD only provides
 updates for second generation EPYC CPUs. Various Ryzen CPUs are
 also affected, but no updates are available yet.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.10.179-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
