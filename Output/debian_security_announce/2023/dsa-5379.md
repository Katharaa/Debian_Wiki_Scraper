DSA-5379-1 dino-im -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
27 Mar 2023
Affected Packages:

[dino-im](https://packages.debian.org/src:dino-im)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1033370](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1033370).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2023-28686](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-28686).  

More information:

Kim Alvefur discovered that insufficient message sender validation in
dino-im, a modern XMPP/Jabber client, may result in manipulation of
entries in the personal bookmark store without user interaction via a
specially crafted message. Additionally an attacker can take advantage
of this flaw to change how group chats are displayed or force a user to
join or leave an attacker-selected groupchat.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.0-3+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your dino-im packages.
