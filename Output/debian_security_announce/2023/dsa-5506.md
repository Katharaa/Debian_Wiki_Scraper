More information:

Multiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser, which could potentially result in the execution of arbitrary
code.


Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 102.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 115.x releases.


Between 102.x and 115.x, Firefox has seen a number of feature updates.
For more information please refer to
<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/115.0esr/releasenotes/>


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 115.3.0esr-1~deb11u1.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 115.3.0esr-1~deb12u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.
