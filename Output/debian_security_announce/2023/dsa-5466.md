More information:

It was discovered that ntpd in ntpsec, a secure, hardened, and improved
implementation derived from the original NTP project, could crash if NTS
is disabled and an NTS-enabled client request (mode 3) is received.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2+dfsg1-1+deb12u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ntpsec packages.
