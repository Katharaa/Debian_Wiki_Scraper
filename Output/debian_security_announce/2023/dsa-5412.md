More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libraw, a library for reading
RAW files obtained from digital photo cameras, which may result in
denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if specially
crafted files are processed.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.20.2-1+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libraw packages.
