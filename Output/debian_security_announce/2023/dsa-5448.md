More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2023-2124](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2124)
Kyle Zeng, Akshay Ajayan and Fish Wang discovered that missing
 metadata validation may result in denial of service or potential
 privilege escalation if a corrupted XFS disk image is mounted.
* [CVE-2023-2156](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2156)
It was discovered that the IPv6 RPL protocol implementation in the
 Linux kernel did not properly handled user-supplied data, resulting
 in a triggerable assertion. An unauthenticated remote attacker can
 take advantage of this flaw for denial of service.
* [CVE-2023-2269](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2269)
Zheng Zhang reported that improper handling of locking in the device
 mapper implementation may result in denial of service.
* [CVE-2023-3090](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3090)
It was discovered that missing initialization in ipvlan networking
 may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, resulting in
 denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2023-3212](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3212)
Yang Lan that missing validation in the GFS2 filesystem could result
 in denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference when mounting a
 malformed GFS2 filesystem.
* [CVE-2023-3268](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3268)
It was discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access in relayfs
 could result in denial of service or an information leak.
* [CVE-2023-3269](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3269)
Ruihan Li discovered that incorrect lock handling for accessing and
 updating virtual memory areas (VMAs) may result in privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2023-3390](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-3390)
A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by incorrect
 error path handling may result in denial of service or privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2023-31084](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31084)
It was discovered that the DVB Core driver does not properly handle
 locking of certain events, allowing a local user to cause a denial
 of service.
* [CVE-2023-32250](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-32250)
/ [CVE-2023-32254](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-32254)


Quentin Minster discovered two race conditions in KSMBD, a kernel
 server which implements the SMB3 protocol, which could result in
 denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2023-35788](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-35788)
Hangyu Hua discovered an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the
 Flower classifier which may result in denial of service or the
 execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.1.37-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
