More information:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in rails, the Ruby based server-side
MVC web application framework, which could lead to XSS and DOM based
cross-site scripting (CRS).


This update also fixes a regression introduced in previous update that
may block certain access for applications using development environment.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:6.0.3.7+dfsg-2+deb11u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.
