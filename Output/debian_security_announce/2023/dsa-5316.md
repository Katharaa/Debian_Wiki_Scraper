More information:

Several out-of-memory, stack overflow or HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities
have been discovered in Netty, a Java NIO client/server socket framework, which
may allow attackers to cause a denial of service or bypass restrictions when
used as a proxy.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.1.48-4+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your netty packages.
