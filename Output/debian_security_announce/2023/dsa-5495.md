Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in frr, the FRRouting suite of
internet protocols, while processing malformed requests and packets the BGP
daemon may have reachable assertions, NULL pointer dereference, out-of-bounds
memory access, which may lead to denial of service attack.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.5.1-1.1+deb11u2.
