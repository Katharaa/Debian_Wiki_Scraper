Affected Packages:

[linux](https://packages.debian.org/src:linux)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2022-40982](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-40982), [CVE-2023-20569](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-20569).  

More information:

* [CVE-2022-40982](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-40982)
Daniel Moghimi discovered Gather Data Sampling (GDS), a hardware
 vulnerability for Intel CPUs which allows unprivileged speculative
 access to data which was previously stored in vector registers.


This mitigation requires updated CPU microcode provided in the
 intel-microcode package.


For details please refer to
 <https://downfall.page/> and
 <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/gather-data-sampling.html>.
* [CVE-2023-20569](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-20569)
Daniel Trujillo, Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered
 INCEPTION, also known as Speculative Return Stack Overflow (SRSO),
 a transient execution attack that leaks arbitrary data on all AMD
 Zen CPUs. An attacker can mis-train the CPU BTB to predict non
 architectural CALL instructions in kernel space and use this to
 control the speculative target of a subsequent kernel RET,
 potentially leading to information disclosure via a speculative
 side-channel.


For details please refer to
 <https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/microarch/inception/> and
 <https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7005>.


For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.10.179-5.


For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.1.38-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
