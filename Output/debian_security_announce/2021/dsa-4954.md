------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Aug 2021
Affected Packages:

[c-ares](https://packages.debian.org/src:c-ares)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 992053](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=992053).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-3672](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3672).  

More information:

Philipp Jeitner and Haya Shulman discovered a flaw in c-ares, a library
that performs DNS requests and name resolution asynchronously. Missing
input validation of hostnames returned by DNS servers can lead to output
of wrong hostnames (leading to Domain Hijacking).


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.14.0-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your c-ares packages.
