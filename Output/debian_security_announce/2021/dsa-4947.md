More information:

Andrea Fioraldi discovered a buffer overflow in libsndfile, a library
for reading/writing audio files, which could result in denial of service
or potentially the execution of arbitrary code when processing a
malformed audio file.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.28-6+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libsndfile packages.
