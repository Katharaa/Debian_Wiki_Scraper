More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2020-36311](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-36311)
A flaw was discovered in the KVM subsystem for AMD CPUs, allowing an
 attacker to cause a denial of service by triggering destruction of a
 large SEV VM.
* [CVE-2021-3609](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3609)
Norbert Slusarek reported a race condition vulnerability in the CAN
 BCM networking protocol, allowing a local attacker to escalate
 privileges.
* [CVE-2021-33909](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33909)
The Qualys Research Labs discovered a size\_t-to-int conversion
 vulnerability in the Linux kernel's filesystem layer. An
 unprivileged local attacker able to create, mount, and then delete a
 deep directory structure whose total path length exceeds 1GB, can
 take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation.

* [CVE-2021-34693](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-34693)
Norbert Slusarek discovered an information leak in the CAN BCM
 networking protocol. A local attacker can take advantage of this
 flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.19.194-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
