More information:

This update ships updated CPU microcode for some types of Intel CPUs and
provides mitigations for security vulnerabilities which could result in
privilege escalation in combination with VT-d and various side channel
attacks.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.20210608.2~deb10u1.


Note that there are two reported regressions; for some CoffeeLake CPUs
this update may break iwlwifi
(https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files/issues/56)
and some for Skylake R0/D0 CPUs on systems using a very outdated firmware/BIOS,
the system may hang on boot:
(https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files/issues/31)


If you are affected by those issues, you can recover by disabling microcode
loading on boot (as documented in README.Debian, also available online at
[https://salsa.debian.org/hmh/intel-microcode/-/blob/master/debian/README.Debian)](https://salsa.debian.org/hmh/intel-microcode/-/blob/master/debian/README.Debian)


We recommend that you upgrade your intel-microcode packages.
