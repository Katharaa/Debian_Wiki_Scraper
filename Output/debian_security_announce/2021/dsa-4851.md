DSA-4851-1 subversion -- security update
----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
13 Feb 2021
Affected Packages:

[subversion](https://packages.debian.org/src:subversion)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 982464](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=982464).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-17525](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-17525).  

More information:

Thomas Akesson discovered a remotely triggerable vulnerability in the
mod\_authz\_svn module in Subversion, a version control system. When using
in-repository authz rules with the AuthzSVNReposRelativeAccessFile
option an unauthenticated remote client can take advantage of this flaw
to cause a denial of service by sending a request for a non-existing
repository URL.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.4-1+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.
