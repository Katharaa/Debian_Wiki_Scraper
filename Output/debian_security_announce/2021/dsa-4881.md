More information:

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library:


* [CVE-2020-8169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8169)
Marek Szlagor reported that libcurl could be tricked into prepending
 a part of the password to the host name before it resolves it,
 potentially leaking the partial password over the network and to the
 DNS server(s).
* [CVE-2020-8177](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8177)
sn reported that curl could be tricked by a malicious server into
 overwriting a local file when using the -J (--remote-header-name) and
 -i (--include) options in the same command line.
* [CVE-2020-8231](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8231)
Marc Aldorasi reported that libcurl might use the wrong connection
 when an application using libcurl's multi API sets the option
 CURLOPT\_CONNECT\_ONLY, which could lead to information leaks.
* [CVE-2020-8284](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8284)
Varnavas Papaioannou reported that a malicious server could use the
 PASV response to trick curl into connecting back to an arbitrary IP
 address and port, potentially making curl extract information about
 services that are otherwise private and not disclosed.
* [CVE-2020-8285](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8285)
xnynx reported that libcurl could run out of stack space when using
 the FTP wildcard matching functionality (CURLOPT\_CHUNK\_BGN\_FUNCTION).
* [CVE-2020-8286](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8286)
It was reported that libcurl didn't verify that an OCSP response
 actually matches the certificate it is intended to.
* [CVE-2021-22876](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22876)
Viktor Szakats reported that libcurl does not strip off user
 credentials from the URL when automatically populating the Referer
 HTTP request header field in outgoing HTTP requests.
* [CVE-2021-22890](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22890)
Mingtao Yang reported that, when using an HTTPS proxy and TLS 1.3,
 libcurl could confuse session tickets arriving from the HTTPS proxy
 as if they arrived from the remote server instead. This could allow
 an HTTPS proxy to trick libcurl into using the wrong session ticket
 for the host and thereby circumvent the server TLS certificate check.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.64.0-4+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
