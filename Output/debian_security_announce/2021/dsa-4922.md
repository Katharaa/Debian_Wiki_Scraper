DSA-4922-1 hyperkitty -- security update
----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
29 May 2021
Affected Packages:

[hyperkitty](https://packages.debian.org/src:hyperkitty)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-33038](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33038).  

More information:

Amir Sarabadani and Kunal Mehta discovered that the import functionality
of Hyperkitty, the web user interface to access Mailman 3 archives, did
not restrict the visibility of private archives during the import, i.e.
that during the import of a private Mailman 2 archive the archive was
publicly accessible until the import completed.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your hyperkitty packages.
