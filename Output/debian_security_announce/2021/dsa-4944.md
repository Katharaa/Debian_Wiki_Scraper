DSA-4944-1 krb5 -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
25 Jul 2021
Affected Packages:

[krb5](https://packages.debian.org/src:krb5)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 991365](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=991365).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-36222](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-36222).  

More information:

It was discovered that the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in krb5, the
MIT implementation of Kerberos, is prone to a NULL pointer dereference
flaw. An unauthenticated attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
cause a denial of service (KDC crash) by sending a request containing a
PA-ENCRYPTED-CHALLENGE padata element without using FAST.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.17-3+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.
