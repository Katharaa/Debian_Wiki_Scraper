More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel
that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or
information leaks.


* [CVE-2020-3702](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-3702)
A flaw was found in the driver for Atheros IEEE 802.11n family of
 chipsets (ath9k) allowing information disclosure.
* [CVE-2020-16119](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-16119)
Hadar Manor reported a use-after-free in the DCCP protocol
 implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker can take
 advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially
 to execute arbitrary code.
* [CVE-2021-3653](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3653)
Maxim Levitsky discovered a vulnerability in the KVM hypervisor
 implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel: Missing
 validation of the `int\_ctl` VMCB field could allow a malicious L1
 guest to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller)
 for the L2 guest. The L2 guest can take advantage of this flaw to
 write to a limited but still relatively large subset of the host
 physical memory.
* [CVE-2021-3656](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3656)
Maxim Levitsky and Paolo Bonzini discovered a flaw in the KVM
 hypervisor implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel.
 Missing validation of the `virt\_ext` VMCB field could allow a
 malicious L1 guest to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS
 (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. Under these circumstances,
 the L2 guest is able to run VMLOAD/VMSAVE unintercepted and thus
 read/write portions of the host's physical memory.
* [CVE-2021-3679](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3679)
A flaw in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality could allow
 a privileged local user (with CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN capability) to cause a
 denial of service (resource starvation).
* [CVE-2021-3732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3732)
Alois Wohlschlager reported a flaw in the implementation of the
 overlayfs subsystem, allowing a local attacker with privileges to
 mount a filesystem to reveal files hidden in the original mount.
* [CVE-2021-3739](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3739)
A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the btrfs filesystem,
 allowing a local attacker with CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN capabilities to cause a
 denial of service.
* [CVE-2021-3743](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3743)
An out-of-bounds memory read was discovered in the Qualcomm IPC
 router protocol implementation, allowing to cause a denial of
 service or information leak.
* [CVE-2021-3753](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3753)
Minh Yuan reported a race condition in the vt\_k\_ioctl in
 drivers/tty/vt/vt\_ioctl.c, which may cause an out of bounds
 read in vt.
* [CVE-2021-37576](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-37576)
Alexey Kardashevskiy reported a buffer overflow in the KVM subsystem
 on the powerpc platform, which allows KVM guest OS users to cause
 memory corruption on the host.
* [CVE-2021-38160](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38160)
A flaw in the virtio\_console was discovered allowing data corruption
 or data loss by an untrusted device.
* [CVE-2021-38166](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38166)
An integer overflow flaw in the BPF subsystem could allow a local
 attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially the execution
 of arbitrary code. This flaw is mitigated by default in Debian as
 unprivileged calls to bpf() are disabled.
* [CVE-2021-38199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38199)
Michael Wakabayashi reported a flaw in the NFSv4 client
 implementation, where incorrect connection setup ordering allows
 operations of a remote NFSv4 server to cause a denial of service.
* [CVE-2021-40490](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-40490)
A race condition was discovered in the ext4 subsystem when writing
 to an inline\_data file while its xattrs are changing. This could
 result in denial of service.
* [CVE-2021-41073](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-41073)
Valentina Palmiotti discovered a flaw in io\_uring allowing a local
 attacker to escalate privileges.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.46-5. This update includes fixes for #993948 and #993978.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
