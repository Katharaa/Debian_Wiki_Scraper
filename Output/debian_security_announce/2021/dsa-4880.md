DSA-4880-1 lxml -- security update
----------------------------------



Date Reported:
29 Mar 2021
Affected Packages:

[lxml](https://packages.debian.org/src:lxml)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 985643](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=985643).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-28957](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28957).  

More information:

Kevin Chung discovered that lxml, a Python binding for the libxml2 and
libxslt libraries, did not properly sanitize its input. This would
allow a malicious user to mount a cross-site scripting attack.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.3.2-1+deb10u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your lxml packages.
