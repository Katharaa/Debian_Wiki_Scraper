More information:

It was discovered that sandbox restrictions in Flatpak, an application
deployment framework for desktop apps, could be bypassed for a Flatpak
app with direct access to AF\_UNIX sockets, by manipulating the VFS using
mount-related syscalls that are not blocked by Flatpak's denylist
seccomp filter.
