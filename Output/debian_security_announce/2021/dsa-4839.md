More information:

The Qualys Research Labs discovered a heap-based buffer overflow
vulnerability in sudo, a program designed to provide limited super user
privileges to specific users. Any local user (sudoers and non-sudoers)
can exploit this flaw for root privilege escalation.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.27-1+deb10u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.
