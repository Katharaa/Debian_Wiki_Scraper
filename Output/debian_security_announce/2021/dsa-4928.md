More information:

A buffer overflow was discovered in HTMLDOC, a HTML processor that
generates indexed HTML, PS, and PDF, which could potentially result in
the execution of arbitrary code. In addition a number of crashes
were addressed.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.3-1+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your htmldoc packages.
