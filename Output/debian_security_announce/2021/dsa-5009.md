DSA-5009-1 tomcat9 -- security update
-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
12 Nov 2021
Affected Packages:

[tomcat9](https://packages.debian.org/src:tomcat9)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-42340](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-42340).  

More information:

Apache Tomcat, the servlet and JSP engine, did not properly release an HTTP
upgrade connection for WebSocket connections once the WebSocket connection was
closed. This created a memory leak that, over time, could lead to a denial of
service via an OutOfMemoryError.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.0.43-2~deb11u3.


We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat9 packages.
