It was discovered that modsecurity-apache, an Apache module to tighten
the Web application security, does not properly handles excessively
nested JSON objects, which could result in denial of service. The update
introduces a new SecRequestBodyJsonDepthLimit option to limit the
maximum request body JSON parsing depth which ModSecurity will accept
(defaults to 10000).


For the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.9.3-1+deb10u1.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
