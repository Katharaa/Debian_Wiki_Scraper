DSA-4829-1 coturn -- security update
------------------------------------



Date Reported:
11 Jan 2021
Affected Packages:

[coturn](https://packages.debian.org/src:coturn)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2020-26262](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-26262).  

More information:

A flaw was discovered in coturn, a TURN and STUN server for VoIP. By
default coturn does not allow peers on the loopback addresses
(127.x.x.x and ::1). A remote attacker can bypass the protection via a
specially crafted request using a peer address of 0.0.0.0 and trick
coturn in relaying to the loopback interface. If listening on IPv6 the
loopback interface can also be reached by using either [::1] or [::] as
the address.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.1.1-1.1+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your coturn packages.
