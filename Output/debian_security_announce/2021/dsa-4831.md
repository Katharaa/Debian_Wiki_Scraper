More information:

Johan Smits discovered that ruby-redcarpet, a markdown parser, did not
properly validate its input. This would allow an attacker to mount a
cross-site scripting attack.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.0-4+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-redcarpet packages.
