More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix.


* [CVE-2016-2124](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2124)
Stefan Metzmacher reported that SMB1 client connections can be
 downgraded to plaintext authentication.
* [CVE-2020-25717](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25717)
Andrew Bartlett reported that Samba may map domain users to local
 users in an undesired way, allowing for privilege escalation. The
 update introduces a new parameter min domain uid (default to 1000)
 to not accept a UNIX uid below this value.
* [CVE-2020-25718](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25718)
Andrew Bartlett reported that Samba as AD DC, when joined by an
 RODC, did not confirm if the RODC was allowed to print a ticket for
 that user, allowing an RODC to print administrator tickets.
* [CVE-2020-25719](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25719)
Andrew Bartlett reported that Samba as AD DC, did not always rely on
 the SID and PAC in Kerberos tickets and could be confused about the
 user a ticket represents. If a privileged account was attacked this
 could lead to total domain compromise.
* [CVE-2020-25721](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25721)
Andrew Bartlett reported that Samba as a AD DC did not provide a way
 for Linux applications to obtain a reliable SID (and samAccountName)
 in issued tickets.
* [CVE-2020-25722](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25722)
Andrew Bartlett reported that Samba as AD DC did not do sufficient
 access and conformance checking of data stored, potentially allowing
 total domain compromise.
* [CVE-2021-3738](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3738)
William Ross reported that the Samba AD DC RPC server can use memory
 that was free'd when a sub-connection is closed, resulting in denial
 of service, and potentially, escalation of privileges.
* [CVE-2021-23192](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-23192)
Stefan Metzmacher reported that if a client to a Samba server sent a
 very large DCE/RPC request, and chose to fragment it, an attacker
 could replace later fragments with their own data, bypassing the
 signature requirements.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.13.13+dfsg-1~deb11u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
