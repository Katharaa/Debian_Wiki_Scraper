In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-26937](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-26937).  

More information:

Felix Weinmann reported a flaw in the handling of combining characters
in screen, a terminal multiplexer with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation,
which can result in denial of service, or potentially the execution of
arbitrary code via a specially crafted UTF-8 character sequence.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.6.2-3+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your screen packages.
