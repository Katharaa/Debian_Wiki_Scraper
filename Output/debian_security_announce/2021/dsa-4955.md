-------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[libspf2](https://packages.debian.org/src:libspf2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-20314](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20314).  

More information:

Philipp Jeitner and Haya Shulman discovered a stack-based buffer
overflow in libspf2, a library for validating mail senders with SPF,
which could result in denial of service, or potentially execution of
arbitrary code when processing a specially crafted SPF record.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.10-7.1~deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libspf2 packages.
