Debian Security Advisory
========================


DSA-4972-1 ghostscript -- security update
-----------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Sep 2021
Affected Packages:

[ghostscript](https://packages.debian.org/src:ghostscript)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 994011](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=994011).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-3781](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3781).  

More information:

It was discovered that Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF interpreter,
does not properly validate access for the "%pipe%", "%handle%" and
"%printer%" io devices, which could result in the execution of arbitrary
code if a malformed Postscript file is processed (despite the -dSAFER
sandbox being enabled).


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.53.3~dfsg-7+deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.
