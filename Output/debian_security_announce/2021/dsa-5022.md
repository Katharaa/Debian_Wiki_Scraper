-------------------------------------------



Date Reported:

Affected Packages:

[apache-log4j2](https://packages.debian.org/src:apache-log4j2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1001729](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1001729).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-45046](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45046).  

More information:

It was found that the fix to address [CVE-2021-44228](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-44228) in Apache Log4j, a Logging Framework for Java, was
incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allow
attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when
the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with
either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread
Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data
using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of service (DOS)
attack.


For the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.16.0-1~deb10u1.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.16.0-1~deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your apache-log4j2 packages.
