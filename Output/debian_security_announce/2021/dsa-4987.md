More information:

Richard Weinberger reported that unsquashfs in squashfs-tools, the tools
to create and extract Squashfs filesystems, does not check for duplicate
filenames within a directory. An attacker can take advantage of this
flaw for writing to arbitrary files to the filesystem if a malformed
Squashfs image is processed.


For the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:4.3-12+deb10u2.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:4.4-2+deb11u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your squashfs-tools packages.
