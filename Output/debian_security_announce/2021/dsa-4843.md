More information:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.


* [CVE-2020-27815](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27815)
A flaw was reported in the JFS filesystem code allowing a local
 attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to cause a
 denial of service.
* [CVE-2020-27825](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27825)
Adam pi3 Zabrocki reported a use-after-free flaw in the ftrace
 ring buffer resizing logic due to a race condition, which could
 result in denial of service or information leak.
* [CVE-2020-27830](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27830)
Shisong Qin reported a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the Speakup
 screen reader core driver.
* [CVE-2020-28374](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-28374)
David Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation
 performed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. An
 attacker with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial Number
 assignments can take advantage of this flaw to read and write to any
 LIO backstore, regardless of the SCSI transport settings.
* [CVE-2020-29568 (XSA-349)](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-29568)
Michael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported that frontends can
 trigger OOM in backends by updating a watched path.
* [CVE-2020-29569 (XSA-350)](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-29569)
Olivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported a use-after-free
 flaw which can be triggered by a block frontend in Linux blkback. A
 misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously
 connecting / disconnecting a block frontend.
* [CVE-2020-29660](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-29660)
Jann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the tty
 subsystem which may allow a local attacker to mount a
 read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID.
* [CVE-2020-29661](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-29661)
Jann Horn reported a locking issue in the tty subsystem which can
 result in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage of
 this flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.
* [CVE-2020-36158](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-36158)
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driver
 which could result in denial of service or the execution of
 arbitrary code via a long SSID value.
* [CVE-2021-3347](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3347)
It was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free
 during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to
 crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege
 escalation.
* [CVE-2021-20177](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20177)
A flaw was discovered in the Linux implementation of string matching
 within a packet. A privileged user (with root or CAP\_NET\_ADMIN) can
 take advantage of this flaw to cause a kernel panic when inserting
 iptables rules.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.19.171-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
