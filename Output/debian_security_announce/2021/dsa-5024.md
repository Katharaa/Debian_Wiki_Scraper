DSA-5024-1 apache-log4j2 -- security update
-------------------------------------------



Date Reported:
18 Dec 2021
Affected Packages:

[apache-log4j2](https://packages.debian.org/src:apache-log4j2)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 1001891](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1001891).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-45105](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45105).  

More information:

It was found that Apache Log4j2, a Logging Framework for Java, did not protect
from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. When the logging
configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for
example, $${ctx:loginId}), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC)
input data can craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup,
resulting in a denial of service.


For the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.17.0-1~deb10u1.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.17.0-1~deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your apache-log4j2 packages.
