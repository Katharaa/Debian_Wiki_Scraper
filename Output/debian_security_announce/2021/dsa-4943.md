Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-35472](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-35472).  

More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in lemonldap-ng, a Web-SSO
system. The flaws could result in information disclosure, authentication
bypass, or could allow an attacker to increase its authentication level
or impersonate another user, especially when lemonldap-ng is configured
to increase authentication level for users authenticated via a second
factor.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.2+ds-7+deb10u6.


We recommend that you upgrade your lemonldap-ng packages.
