-------------------------------------



Date Reported:
10 Feb 2021
Affected Packages:

[libzstd](https://packages.debian.org/src:libzstd)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 981404](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=981404).  

More information:

It was discovered that zstd, a compression utility, temporarily
exposed a world-readable version of its input even if the original
file had restrictive permissions.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.8+dfsg-3+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your libzstd packages.
