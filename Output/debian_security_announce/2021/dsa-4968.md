Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-40346](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-40346).  

More information:

Ori Hollander reported that missing header name length checks in the
htx\_add\_header() and htx\_add\_trailer() functions in HAProxy, a fast and
reliable load balancing reverse proxy, could result in request smuggling
attacks or response splitting attacks.


Additionally this update addresses #993303 introduced in DSA 4960-1
causing HAProxy to fail serving URLs with HTTP/2 containing '//'.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.
