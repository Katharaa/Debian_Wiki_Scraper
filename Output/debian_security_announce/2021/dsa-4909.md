More information:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server
implementation.


* [CVE-2021-25214](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-25214)
Greg Kuechle discovered that a malformed incoming IXFR transfer
 could trigger an assertion failure in named, resulting in denial
 of service.
* [CVE-2021-25215](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-25215)
Siva Kakarla discovered that named could crash when a DNAME record
 placed in the ANSWER section during DNAME chasing turned out to be
 the final answer to a client query.
* [CVE-2021-25216](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-25216)
It was discovered that the SPNEGO implementation used by BIND is
 prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This update switches to
 use the SPNEGO implementation from the Kerberos libraries.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
