Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-28091](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28091).  

More information:

It was discovered that lasso, a library which implements SAML 2.0 and
Liberty Alliance standards, did not properly verify that all assertions
in a SAML response were properly signed, allowing an attacker to
impersonate users or bypass access control.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.0-2+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your lasso packages.
