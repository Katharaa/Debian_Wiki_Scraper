It was reported that python-bleach, a whitelist-based HTML-sanitizing
library, is prone to a mutation XSS vulnerability in bleach.clean when
svg or math are in the allowed tags, 'p' or br are in allowed
tags, style, title, noscript, script, textarea, noframes,
iframe, or xmp are in allowed tags and 'strip\_comments=False' is
