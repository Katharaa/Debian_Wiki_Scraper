--------------------------------------



Date Reported:
13 Jul 2021
Affected Packages:

[linuxptp](https://packages.debian.org/src:linuxptp)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 990748](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=990748).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-3570](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3570).  

More information:

Miroslav Lichvar reported that the ptp4l program in linuxptp, an
implementation of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), does not validate
the messageLength field of incoming messages, allowing a remote attacker
to cause a denial of service, information leak, or potentially remote
code execution.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.2-1+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your linuxptp packages.
