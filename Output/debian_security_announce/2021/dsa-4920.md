------------------------------------



Date Reported:
24 May 2021
Affected Packages:

[libx11](https://packages.debian.org/src:libx11)

Vulnerable:
Yes
Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 988737](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=988737).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-31535](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-31535).  

More information:

Roman Fiedler reported that missing length validation in various
functions provided by libx11, the X11 client-side library, allow
to inject X11 protocol commands on X clients, leading to
authentication bypass, denial of service or potentially the
execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.6.7-1+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your libx11 packages.
