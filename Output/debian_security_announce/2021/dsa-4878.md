More information:

Ben Caller discovered that Pygments, a syntax highlighting package
written in Python 3, used regular expressions which could result in
denial of service.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.1+dfsg-1+deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your pygments packages.
