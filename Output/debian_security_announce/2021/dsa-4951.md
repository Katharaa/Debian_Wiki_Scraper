Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Bluez, the Linux Bluetooth
protocol stack.


* [CVE-2020-26558](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-26558)
/ [CVE-2021-0129](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-0129)


It was discovered that Bluez does not properly check permissions
 during pairing operation, which could allow an attacker to
 impersonate the initiating device.
* [CVE-2020-27153](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27153)
Jay LV discovered a double free flaw in the disconnect\_cb() routine
 in the gattool. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw
 during service discovery for denial of service, or potentially,
 execution of arbitrary code.


For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.50-1.2~deb10u2.


We recommend that you upgrade your bluez packages.
