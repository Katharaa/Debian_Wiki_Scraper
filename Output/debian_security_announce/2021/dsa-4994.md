More information:

Kishore Kumar Kothapalli discovered that the lame server cache in BIND,
a DNS server implementation, can be abused by an attacker to
significantly degrade resolver performance, resulting in denial of
service (large delays for responses for client queries and DNS timeouts
on client hosts).


For the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u6.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.16.22-1~deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
