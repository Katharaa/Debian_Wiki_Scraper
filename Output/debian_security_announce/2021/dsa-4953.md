Security database references:
In the Debian bugtracking system: [Bug 991971](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=991971).  
In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2021-38165](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38165).  

More information:

Thorsten Glaser and Axel Beckert reported that lynx, a non-graphical
(text-mode) web browser, does not properly handle the userinfo
subcomponent of a URI, which can lead to leaking of credential in
cleartext in SNI data.


For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.9rel.1-3+deb10u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your lynx packages.
