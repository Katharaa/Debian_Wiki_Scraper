More information:

It was discovered that roundcube, a skinnable AJAX based webmail
solution for IMAP servers, did not properly sanitize requests and mail
messages. This would allow an attacker to perform Cross-Side Scripting
(XSS) or SQL injection attacks.


For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.3.17+dfsg.1-1~deb10u1.


For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.12+dfsg.1-1~deb11u1.


We recommend that you upgrade your roundcube packages.
