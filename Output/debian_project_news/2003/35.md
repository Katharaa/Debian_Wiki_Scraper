Debian Weekly News - September 2nd, 2003
========================================


Welcome to this year's 35th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. The discussion about legalizing [software patents](http://swpat.ffii.org/) in Europe was held so [controversial](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/foren/go.shtml?read=1&msg_id=4088125&forum_id=46660) that the vote was postponed, as Ciaran O'Riordan from the [FSF](http://www.fsf.org/) reported. At the 10th international
conference of [European Association for
Japanese Studies](http://www.eajs.org/) in Warsaw Janusz Bień gave a [talk](http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~jsbien/slajdy/JSB-EAJS03-s.pdf) on
Debian GNU/Linux as a Japanese language teaching platform.


**Opteron Support for Debian.** The Debian project has [received](https://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64-0308/msg00035.html)
full access to a Dual Opteron [machine](https://db.debian.org/machines.cgi?host=pergolesi) for [porting](https://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/) efforts. Mattias Wadenstein also
maintains a similar machine and hands out accounts to interested developers.
This port aims at supporting a mixed 32/64 bit userland, which requires
significant [changes](https://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64-0308/msg00046.html) in
the Debian infrastructure that will most probably not happen in time for the
release of sarge. The developer list has also been [renamed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64-0308/msg00104.html) to
[debian-amd64](https://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64/) to [reflect](https://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64-0308/msg00022.html) the
general architecture name.


**Per-User Init System.** Jerry Haltom [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03466.html)
what others thought about a per-user init system that would be able to start
user-based services upon system startup without handing out root access to the
users. However, Colin Watson [pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03476.html) out
that this can already be achieved with an `@reboot` line in the
normal crontab.


**Binary Packages from multiple Sources.** Glenn McGrath [investigated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03560.html)
lists of source and binary packages and discovered that, according to the
`.dsc` files, several binary packages were provided by more than
one source package. In his opinion a virtual package should be used when a
binary package is provided by multiple source packages.


**LWN Subscription for Debian Developers.** Bdale Garbee [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0308/msg00019.html) about HP sponsoring LWN subscription for Debian developers since
many people asked whether this offer still stands. If you are a Debian
developer and want full access to [lwn.net](http://lwn.net/), go to
their website, create an account for yourself, then send a mail to
lwn-subscription@debian.org containing your LWN account name and sign this
mail with your key on the Debian keyring. Eventually, Bdale will process the
request and send an acknowledgement.


**Debian Archive Growth.** Jason Andrade [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03887.html)
that the Debian archive is about to hit the 100 GB mark on his [mirror](http://ftp.au.debian.org/debian/) and wondered if there is
any way to reduce the size of the archive over the next weeks before he can
insert a new disk. Josip Rodin [answered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03914.html)
that about 7 GB will be freed when potato is moved to [archive.debian.org](http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/).
Marcelo Magallon [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03929.html) the
size of all binary packages belonging to the given architecture in the
specified suites.


**Survey about the Freeness of the FDL.** Branden Robinson
posted the [results](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0308/msg00017.html) of a [survey](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0308/msg01031.html) to
measure the level of consensus on whether the [GNU Free Documentation License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html)
(FDL) is considered a free license according to the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)
(DFSG) or not. The majority of Debian developers and also the majority of
non-developers don't regard the GNU FDL as a license that can easily satisfy
the DFSG.


**Installer Packages spread throughout "main" and "contrib".** Tore
Anderson [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03987.html) why installers of non-free software are located in supposedly
free sections. He [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03990.html)
that one would not expect non-free software to be installed on the system,
when using the contrib section. Mathieu Roy [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03991.html) that
software in contrib that has only the purpose of installing non-free software
in its postinst script is a good candidate for non-free itself.


**Interview with Morphix Founder.** Prakash Advani conducted
an [interview](http://www.newsforge.com/newsforge/03/08/19/1518217.shtml) with Alex de Landgraaf, the founder and the lead maintainer of
the [Morphix](http://morphix.sourceforge.net/) project. He
explained that Morphix, which is based on [Knoppix](http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/), has a modular design to
build a live CD, which would relieve all remasterers and let them work on the
actual task at hand.
