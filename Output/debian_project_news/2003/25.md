Debian Weekly News - June 24th, 2003
====================================


Welcome to this year's 25th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Debian 3.0 has been on the [cover](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://www.debianplanet.org/debianplanet/node.php?id=972) of
the Australian [Australian Personal
Computer](http://www.apcmag.com/) magazine for the first time ever. Rob Savoye [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-ia64-0305/msg00008.html) an
interesting experience of bringing up a rack of 20 dual processor Itanium II
machines (HP zx6000s), over a 48 hour period. All of them are now running
Debian.


**Security Update Procedure.** Matt Zimmerman [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0306/msg00010.html) that many package maintainers are not aware of the
recommended methods for handling security issues in their packages. Therefore
he urges anyone who participates in package maintenance to read the relevant
[section](https://www.debian.org/doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) in the [Developer's
Reference](https://www.debian.org/doc/developers-reference/) which documents the current recommended procedures. It has
recently been updated with additional details and clarifications.


**Freeze Date Estimate.** Drew Scott Daniels [talked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0306/msg00004.html)
about freeze date estimates which he believes are useful for developers to
help to prepare for a release. He expects the debian-installer to be finished
in two months which makes him expect a freeze this year. He also estimates
that the freeze cycle will last 6 months.


**Debian presence at LinuxTag.** The Debian project will be
exhibiting at [LinuxTag](http://www.linuxtag.org/) in Karlsruhe,
Germany from July 10th to 13th with a booth in the exhibition and a [day](http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2003/day.html) of
talks and workshops dedicated to developers and interested users on July 11
2003. Newsforge has a [story](http://www.newsforge.com/newsforge/03/06/14/130256.shtml?tid=23)
that details several of the non-profit [exhibitors](http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2003/projects.php3).


**Popularity Contest Revised.** Bill Allombert [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00770.html)
that he has written a replacement [page](https://people.debian.org/~ballombe/popcon) for Avery Pennarun's
now broken popularity contest web page. He's also made the page's
script [available](https://people.debian.org/~ballombe/popcon/popcon.pl). It sorts the results by number of installs, number of votes
and more.


**Knoppix and MAME.** [KnoppiXMAME 1.0](http://freshmeat.net/releases/126525/) was released,
as [announced](http://games.slashdot.org/games/03/06/19/1427228.shtml) on Slashdot. [KnoppiXMAME](http://freshmeat.net/projects/knoppixmame/) is a
bootable arcade machine emulator powered by Knoppix Debian GNU/Linux, [X-MAME](http://www.icewalkers.com/Linux/Software/54910/X-Mame.html)
0.69, and [gxmame](http://gxmame.sourceforge.net/) 0.33. The ISO
image is only 200 MB large. You can put the ROMs on the CD ISO without
remastering/recompressing [Knoppix.](http://www.knoppix.org/)


**80,000 GNU/Linux Computers in Schools.** According to [DesktopLinux.org](http://www.desktoplinux.org/news/NS5160643271.html)
a sweeping initiative in Extremadura, Spain has put 80,000 GNU/Linux computers in schools.
The systems feature a [customized](http://www.linex.org/linex2/linex/ingles/index_ing.html)
version of Debian, called [GNU/LinEx](http://www.linex.org), and
features the GNOME desktop and other Free Software productivity programs.


**Voting Method General Resolution Results.** Manoj Srivastava
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0306/msg00072.html)
the results of the condorcet/Clone proof SSD Voting Method General Resolution.
There were a total of 160 unique votes cast, with 144 votes in favour of the
resolution. Therefore, the resolution passed with a 9:1 super majority, which is
in excess of the required 3:1 majority.


**LaTeX Project Public License.** The LaTeX Project Public
License (LPPL) has previously been [considered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0202/msg00123.html)
non-free under the terms of the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) (DFSG). Jeff Licquia has now posted a new
[revision](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0306/msg00210.html) of the LPPL, which he believes satisfies the DFSG. There was [general](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0306/msg00219.html) [agreement](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0306/msg00221.html)
that the new license is DFSG-free and after a [year of
work](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0306/msg00229.html) and perhaps 1,500 emails in total, the issue should hopefully be
resolved.


**Hardware Donations.** Benjamin Mako Hill, the Debian
Hardware Donations Manager, announced the availability of various hardware
donations. Several [SGI Indys](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01311.html)
have been donated to Debian recently in California, USA and Germany, and an [Alphastation
200](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01310.html) may be available in Amsterdam. Mako also noted that there is no
developer accessible Hurd machine available, but would be happy to [coordinate](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01308.html) the donation of hardware for this if it is something that
developers feel would be useful.


 **Open Source and Mayor Election.** This Wired news [story](http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,58764,00.html) tells
us about a candidate for Mayor of [Zaragoza](http://www.ayto-zaragoza.es/), Spain, who is using the benefits of open source development as
his platform for the election. Handing out copies of [Augustux](http://www.zaralinux.org/proy/augustux/) a Debian based
distribution, and talking about free wireless Internet access for all, Belloch
can clearly explain how free and open technologies can be translated into
opportunities, political participation, economic growth and social welfare,
with hard numbers and real details.


**Software Patents in Europe.** Wookey [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0306/msg00259.html)
about the current status of Software Patents in Europe. Recently there has
been a vote by the JURI committee which essentially allows complete
patentability of software. There have been no significant provisions to help
Free Software or reduce the effect on small businesses. The issue is very
urgent! Wookey continues with a report about the conference about software
patents in Brussels from May 5th to 7th.


**Using apt-get with Rsync.** Dan Jacobson wanted to [know](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01091.html) if
using the [rsync method](http://home.tiscali.cz:8080/~cz210552/aptrsync.html) for `apt-get` only affects fetching of the
`Packages` files or if it will also fetch the packages via
`rsync`. Colin Watson [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01100.html) that
`gzip` already contains a patch to create rsync-friendly
archives.


**Missing Package Dates.** Dan Jacobson [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01120.html) that
the `Packages` files don't contain information about when a package
was uploaded. Hence, without downloading and looking at the
changelog file one can't say
whether it is a package that was updated recently or another which hasn't been
updated for a long time.


**Ceasing Support for Libc 5.** Francesco Lovergine [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01153.html)
to drop all i386-specific packages which are libc5 related. Some of these may
be required to run proprietary non-free software, though.


**Perl License Clarification.** Marc Haber [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01159.html)
that ftp people reject packages that are distributed "under the same terms as
Perl itself". However, Perl is dual-licensed, using the GNU [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) and the [Artistic](http://www.perl.com/pub/a/language/misc/Artistic.html)
license. Many people [acknowledged](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0302/msg00039.html) this as a possible problem and recommended that
upstream be made aware of the flexibility of interpretation of the Perl style
copyright and licensing.


**Annoying teTeX Upgrade Questions.** Bernd Eckenfels [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01178.html)
that upgrading teTeX packages results in updating configuration files. This
won't be a problem at all, but upon upgrade the user is asked for many files
whether it should be updated since allegedly local changes were made. Matt
Zimmerman [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01232.html) that this happens when a configuration file moves from one
package to another, is renamed, or when a configuration file switches to being
a configuration file when it was previously not.


**Improper Package Description.** Javier FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino
PeÃ±a [complained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01273.html) about wrongly used package descriptions. The description
should be written so that it gives the system administrator enough information
to decide whether to install the package. Several packages fail to meet this
requirement, hence, Javier is going to open bug reports accordingly.


**Read-only Root Filesystem.** Thomas Hood [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01291.html)
that some progress has been made towards the [goal](http://panopticon.csustan.edu/thood/readonly-root.html) of
making Debian easier to use with a read-only root filesystem. Action has been
taken to remove variable files from the directory `/etc/`, or at
least to make it possible to do so locally.


**Packaging Haskell Libraries.** Isaac Jones [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01373.html)
about problems with packaging Haskell libraries. There has been a lot of
discussion recently on the Haskell mailing lists about the best ways to
package Haskell libraries and tools for Debian. One problem is that almost
all Haskell compilers, interpreters and releases are binary-incompatible.
