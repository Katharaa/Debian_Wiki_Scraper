Debian Weekly News - September 23rd, 2003
=========================================


Welcome to this year's 38th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Since [Knoppix](http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/)
only uses KDE these days, several GNOME people have created [Gnoppix](http://www.gnoppix.org/) which includes their favourite desktop
environment. Matt Zimmerman also [discovered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00893.html)
horrific new levels of changelog abuse.


**New CD Image Server.** Mattias Wadenstein [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors-0309/msg00000.html)
the new [cdimage.debian.org](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/)
with iso images and an authoritative directory structure. Since many people
still don't use [Jigdo](https://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/) to download and build
the Debian [images](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/images/),
they are available as well. He is also looking for sites to [mirror](http://www.acc.umu.se/~maswan/debian-push/cdimage/) the
server.
**Skolelinux Debian Labs?** Martin Michlmayr [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0309/msg00020.html)
that Skolelinux is very successful in Norway and has gained some funding.
Everything Skolelinux does is being integrated into Debian, they are working
especially hard on making debian-installer a functional installer. Hence,
they could name its foundation with the name "Skolelinux Debian Labs" to
reflect their origins and relationship with the Debian project.


**Bits from the Project Leader.** Martin Michlmayr [summarised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0309/msg00008.html) the time he spent at several conferences. He reported
about several Opteron machines that were and are planned to be donated to the
project. [Xandros](http://www.xandros.com/) has agreed to work
with Debian to make sure that sarge will be LSB compliant. He also said that
there is a great demand for Debian from governments and educational
institutions.


**Export Clauses in XFree86 License.** Henning Makholm [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00723.html)
some clauses in XFree86's copyright file which appeared to be non-free. It
was [generally](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00800.html)
[agreed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00811.html)
that these clauses fail the requirements of the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines).
Branden Robinson [concurred](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00847.html)
with that view and resolved to identify which code is affected. He thought
it might be easier get the code dual licensed, rather than completely
re-licensed. Branden would like assistance with this and offered commit
access to the X Strike Force Subversion repository as temptation.


**Rpmseek includes Debian Packages.** Newsforge [reports](http://newsvac.newsforge.com/newsvac/03/09/18/158209.shtml?tid=52)
that rpmseek.com has expanded its search facilities to include .deb packages
from Debian's distribution, as well as numerous other archives of Debian
packages. The [rpmseek.com](http://www.rpmseek.com/index.html?hl=com) site is one
of the largest web directories for Linux software in general, although one
reader noted that `apt-cache search string` achieves much the same
result for Debian users. And if the default repository choices aren't
enough, [apt-get.org](http://www.apt-get.org/) contains many more
suggestions to add to your list of repositories to search.


**Skolelinux merging with Debian-Edu.** Andreas Schuldei [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0309/msg00011.html) that the [Skolelinux](http://www.skolelinux.no/)
project and the [Debian-Edu](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu)
sub-project will merge in order to continue the Debian-Edu effort and to avoid
the Knoppix effect. The [goal](http://developer.skolelinux.no/arkitektur/arkitektur)
is to create a Debian distribution especially geared towards easy and
large-scale deployment in schools. The subproject will also create courseware
(lessons, homework, exams, solutions to exams) in the future, which are
compatible with Debian.


**Debian Kernel Packages overly patched?** Martin F. Krafft
[complained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg01133.html) about the Debian kernel packages containing too many patches,
especially some that make the grsecurity patch not apply anymore. Herbert Xu
carefully selected some backports to include such as [IPsec](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg01135.html).
