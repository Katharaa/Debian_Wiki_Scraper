Debian Weekly News - September 16th, 2003
=========================================


Welcome to this year's 37th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Several readers told us that the first hardware audio
player that supports Ogg/Vorbis is the [NeurosAudio](http://www.neurosaudio.com/) and has been shipping for months. They are said to also
support one of the key Ogg authors and also supply a synchronization manager for
GNU/Linux, [positron](https://packages.debian.org/positron), which
is packaged and distributed with Debian.


**Too many Versions of Tcl?** Andreas Rottmann [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00468.html)
why there are four different versions (8.0, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4) of the Tcl
programming environment in the archive. Matthew Palmer [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00514.html)
that Tcl isn't particularly backwards compatible. Hence, several packages
don't run or build with newer versions of the language.


**Status of Testing Migration.** Petter Reinholdtsen [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00485.html)
that the [migration](http://developer.skolelinux.no/info/cdbygging/distdiff-all.html.gz) of packages into testing has been slowed down significantly. At
least partially this is due to the mips buildd being under heavy load. Colin
Watson [pointed out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00498.html) that the reason is glibc 2.3.2 and that there is a good chance
that this will start to clear quite shortly.


**Second Revision of Woody.** An official [announcement](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0309/msg00002.html) has been sent out stating the current status of the [second revision](http://master.debian.org/~joey/3.0r2/) of Debian
woody (3.0r2). This revision is planned to include about 130 security updates
that have been issued since the first revision. Comments should be sent to [Joey](mailto:joey@debian.org) directly.


**No Dueling Banjos from Debian.** Some of the most bizarre [mails](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg00851.html) on
debian-devel over the [years](http://www.google.com/search?as_oq=sheet.music+dueling+banjos&as_sitesearch=debian.org&safe=images) have been [repeated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01368.html) [requests](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00378.html) by
[various](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00027.html)
people for the sheet music for dueling banjos. Several list subscribers [have](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg00874.html) been
[eager](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg00862.html) to
[assist](https://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa-0308/msg00000.html)
the posters in their search. Jim Penny [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00382.html) this
the Dueling Banjo Effect and explained that this has become a
self-perpetuating Google-flop. People use Google which points them to Debian
to get this sheet music, and the act of asking reinforces Google's notion that
Debian is a good place to get the music.


**Criteria for Inclusion in Debian.** Adam Kessel [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00602.html) if
there are guidelines for what gets included in Debian other than what is
required by the [DFSG](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines). Steve Langasek [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00603.html)
that it is rare that Debian would overrule a developer who wishes to maintain
a piece of software which is free and legally distributable. Manoj Srivastava
[added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00656.html)
that if a developer has spent the time and effort to package software and made
it policy compliant, then as long as Debian can legally distribute it, it has
usually found its way in.


**Alternative to the GNU FDL.** Wouter Verhelst [prepared](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00503.html) a
draft documentation license that seeks to retain the spirit of the GNU [Free Documentation License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html)
(FDL), but which he thinks is DFSG-free. Branden Robinson [wasn't sure](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00585.html)
precisely what the FDL's intent is, but thought that it would be more
fruitful to enumerate the license's intentions before constructing the
text.


**Attribution-ShareAlike License.** John Goerzen [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00474.html)
whether the Creative Commons [Attribution-ShareAlike
License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0/) was DFSG-free. On his own [analysis](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00476.html) it
occurred that it would satisfy each requirement of the DFSG. Branden Robinson [agreed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00528.html), but
warned that licenses must also pass a more "holistic" reading to make sure
they aren't non-free despite passing each specific clause of the DFSG.
Florian Weimer
[thought](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00514.html)
it would depend upon whether the
license was applied to a documentation format suitable for editing.


**News from the Package Tracking System.** RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0309/msg00006.html) about a new [feature](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/resources#pts-web) which has been added to the [Package Tracking System](https://packages.qa.debian.org/) (PTS) a few
months ago. It is now possible to add custom information to the PTS web page
for a particular package. The PTS features many useful links (BTS, QA
statistics, contact information, DDTP translation status, buildd logs) and
gathers much more information from various places. There are over 3000
subscriptions from 1500 different addresses for 1650 different source
packages.


**DebConf 4 in Brazil.** Carlos Laviola [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0308/msg00003.html) that the Debian Conference #4 will be held in [Porto
Alegre](http://www.uoregon.edu/~sergiok/brasil/portoalegre.html), Brazil. This country has been extremely active in the Free
Software movement but is very unrepresented at past Debian conferences.
There are already plans planning to host the conference some days
before or after the [FÃ³rum
Internacional de Software Livre](http://www.softwarelivre.org/forum2003/fotos_evento/) (International Free Software Forum), so
that Debian developers can attend this event as well.


**Improvements in the Bug Tracking System.** Colin Watson [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0309/msg00005.html) the new tag 'fixed-upstream' which is intended to
replace the old (mis)use of the 'pending' tag and refers to bugs that were
fixed upstream and the maintainer is only waiting for a new release. The new
'owner' attribute allows maintainer teams to divide the work up more
conveniently. If set the address receives the same mail sent to that bug as a
package maintainer would receive.


**Installing Sarge with the Debian-Installer.** Sebastian Ley
[reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0309/msg00007.html) that the debian-installer team has cleaned up the build process of
debian-installer images. They also put together a [howto](http://cvs.debian.org/debian-installer/doc/INSTALLATION-HOWTO?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup) which guides through the process of installing sarge. At the same
time the Debian-CD team has reviewed the netinst iso [images](http://gluck.debian.org/cdimage/testing/netinst/i386/) for a
sarge installation with the new debian-installer.


**Maintaining Packages with Subversion.** Eduard Bloch
maintains the [svn-devscripts](https://packages.debian.org/svn-devscripts) package which contains tools that help create and maintain
Debian packages in a large Subversion repository. Joey Hess, however, has [problems](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00736.html)
with the implementation and proposed improvements. Graham Wilson also [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00738.html)
another method of importing new upstream source archives.


**Debmirror Survey.** Goswin von Brederlow would like to [know](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00794.html) how
other people use the [debmirror](https://packages.debian.org/debmirror) package to mirror certain parts of the Debian archive. He has
rewritten most of debmirror in an effort to clean up the codebase and to add
flexibility of the actual download method used. For the configuration part he
is seeking input.


**Using proper Build Dependencies.** Joey Hess [discovered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0309/msg00053.html)
a glitch in the [policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/) with regards
to build dependencies. Hence, Wouter Verhelst [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0309/msg00059.html)
how `Build-Depends` and `Build-Depends-Indep` have been
created as a tool to make autobuilding packages easier and [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0309/msg00067.html)
to rewrite the paragraph in the policy.


**Debian-Installer Work Camp.** An [invitation](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0309/msg00146.html)
to the [8th Oldenburg
Linux developers meeting](http://oldenburger.linuxtage.de/Oldenburg2003/) was sent to the debian-boot list since it will
host a [debian-installer debcamp](https://people.debian.org/~pere/debian-installer/di-debcamp-2003-1.html). The meeting will take place at the last weekend
on September in Oldenburg, Germany. Several developers who work on the
debian-installer already subscribed to the meeting.
