Debian Weekly News - December 9th, 2003
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 49th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Not only Debian servers were the target of attackers but
also one of [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200312-01.xml)'s
servers as was the Free Software Foundation's [Savannah](http://savannah.gnu.org/statement.html) system.
Wired News [explained](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.12/view.html?pg=4)
some of the background and context of [LinEx](http://www.linex.org/),
the Spanish Debian variant.


**HP to expand Debian Support.** Hewlett-Packard is [planning](http://www.idg.com.sg/idgwww.nsf/unidlookup/BC9AD040646E591D48256DF30024A162) to expand support offerings to customers who run Debian
GNU/Linux. According to HP Linux Chief Technology Officer and former Debian
Project Leader, Bdale Garbee, "HP Services is working on some projects right
now to increase the number and quality of the support offerings that they can
provide to customers who want to run Debian."
Until now HP's Debian support has only been limited services on request.


**Draft Proposal for new Web Server Policy.** Joey Hess
prepared a [draft proposal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0312/msg00004.html) for a new web server
policy. Joey identified various problems with [current policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-customized-programs#s-web-appl), many of which
come down to a namespace problem. Debian uses the default top-level
namespace of the web server for Debian-provided content, which doesn't give
admins enough control. The nature of Joey's proposed policy means it could
be adopted without requiring immediate changes to everything, but he is first
seeking comments.


**Recovery Status Update.** James Troup sent in an [update](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0312/msg00001.html) on the recovery of Debian hosts after the break-ins. Packages can
be uploaded again into anonymous upload queues and a new [key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/ziyi_key_2003v2.asc) for automatic
signing of Release has been created. Packages won't be compiled for other
architectures since the build daemons need to be checked, updated, hardened
and re-LDAPed.


**Sarge Release Progress.** Anthony Towns [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0312/msg00000.html) about progress made with the preparation of sarge, but the [bug count](https://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/graph.png) has
been rising fairly consistently. He admits that we're not in a position to
offer a roadmap for the release and adds that having critical, grave or
serious bugs open for an extended period is simply not acceptable.
Implicitly he asks maintainer to look after their packages and fix the
outstanding bugs so we get closer to releasing the system.


**Anaconda based CD Images for Sarge.** Ian Murdock [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg00097.html) that
unofficial sarge-based iso images using the Anaconda installer are offered by
[Progeny](http://platform.progeny.com/anaconda/). They
included a tool called picax which builds Anaconda-based installation CDs from a
Debian repository. However, there are [features](http://platform.progeny.com/anaconda/errata.html) that are
not yet working and it
is not recommended for use in a production environment.


**Debian Package Signatures.** Goswin von Brederlow [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg00042.html)
using and distributing digital signatures along with the binary packages
besides the current chain of signed Release file, referenced Packages file and
binary packages. Suggestions include signing binary packages and distributing
signatures separately. Joey Hess [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg00130.html) that
the canonical attack would be to re-insert a Debian package with a known
security hole but a valid signature.


**Debian Enterprise Sub-Project.** Anders Salomon [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg00070.html)
plans to create a new sub-project within Debian. Long term goals include the
possible creation of another branch, security updates on this branch, etc.
Short term goals include an enterprise kernel, security work and an improved
installer.


**Debian UserLinux Roadmap.** Bruce Perens [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg00196.html)
the first pass of a UserLinux [white paper](http://userlinux.com/white_paper.html). He proposed a
non-profit entity in charge of the operating system with surrounding
for-profit companies that are in the business of providing service and
engineering for the UserLinux distribution. Theodore Ts'o [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg00267.html) that
it would be important to also support independent software vendors that
produces proprietary solutions.


**Rebuilding the Distribution.** Steve Kemp has been [experimenting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg00595.html)
with producing a hardened Debian derivative. This mostly means compiling
things with a stackguard compiler, using format guard, and enforcing policies,
etc. Instead of installing the hardened packages on top of Debian stable he
would like to create a concurrent distribution and provide CD images as
well.


**Debian Network Installation.** Tim Krieglstein [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg00598.html)
about his effort to install a cluster of machines with Debian using PXE, DHCP
and a set of hand-made scripts. The first stage boots, partitions the hard
disk, runs `debootstrap` and installs grub. The second stage runs
after reboot and installs debconf and other packages.


**Debian CDs for WSIS.** Mako Hill [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-nonprofit-0311/msg00011.html)
that [CDs](https://lists.debian.org/debian-nonprofit-0311/msg00018.html) will be handed out at the [World Summit on the
Information Society](http://www.geneva2003.org/wsis/indexb01.htm) (WSIS). They are based on [Morphix](http://morphix.sourceforge.net/) and contain GNOME, GNUCash,
Gnumeric, OpenOffice.org, Mozilla, The GIMP, Evolution, XMMS, Bluefish and
some other stuff.


**Debian CD Images updated.** Philip Hands [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0312/msg00057.html) new
CD images that reflect the most recent [update](https://www.debian.org/News/2003/20031121a) (3.0r2). Some packages had to be moved since the images ended up
being larger than 650Â MB initially. Steve Kemp produced the vast majority of
the images.


**Debian-Installer Roadmap.** Joey Hess [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0312/msg00228.html)
that the CVS repository on cvs.debian.org is back, but all pserver accounts
have been disabled. Later Joey added a [timeline](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0312/msg00222.html) in
which no string changes should be made after December 21st. On December 28th
the second beta test will start.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.


* [rsync](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-03/msg00213.html) --
 Remote arbitrary code execution.
