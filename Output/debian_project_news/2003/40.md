Debian Weekly News - October 7th, 2003
======================================


Welcome to this year's 40th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. DivisionTwo.com wrote an amusing [article](http://www.divisiontwo.com/articles/barbieOS.htm) about a
fictitious Barbie OS based on Debian. LinuxIT [announced](http://www.linuxit.com/Press/Press030903.html) it would
release its Linux Professional Institute Certification [training manuals](http://www.linuxit.com/lpi.html) under a free
license.


**emDebian at UK Linux Expo.** LinuxDevices.com [reports](http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS4146203121.html) that
Debian's Vincent Sanders will attend the upcoming [Linux Expo UK](http://www.linuxexpouk.co.uk/Exhibition/Visiting/) to
discuss ideas about emDebian at Debian's stand in the [.Org Village](http://www.linuxexpo.org.uk/). [emDebian's](http://www.emdebian.org/) aims are to improve Debian as
a whole for embedded use and to provide a set of tools to generate embedded
device images simply and quickly. LinuxDevices.com's annual [Embedded Linux
Market Survey](http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT7301151332.html) showed Debian to be the third most popular GNU/Linux
distribution for embedded development.


**Debian Project at European Conferences.** The Debian project
[announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2003/20031005) that its members and
affiliates will attend four exhibitions and conferences that cover Free
Software and GNU/Linux in Europe. On October 7th and 8th [Opensaar](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/1007-opensaar) takes place in
SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany, with a talk about mail services with Debian by Marko
Jung. On October 8th and 9th [Linux Expo UK](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/1008-linuxexpo) will take place in Olympia, London, U.K. This is followed
by [Practical Linux](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/1011-plgiessen) in GieÃen
Germany on October 11th, where Alexander Schmehl will give a talk and a
workshop about Debian. Finally from October 14th to 16th [Linux Kongress](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/1014-linuxkongress) will take
place in SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany, where Thomas Lange will give a [tutorial](http://www.linux-kongress.org/2003/tutorials/index.html#1_1_6) about building a beowulf cluster.


**Summary of the Debian-Installer DebCamp.** Joey Hess sent in
a [summary](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0309/msg00850.html)
of the [DebCamp](https://people.debian.org/~pere/debian-installer/di-debcamp-2003-1.html). He reported that more than ten debian-installer developers met
for four days in [Oldenburg](http://oldenburger.linuxtage.de/Oldenburg2003/) and worked quite successful on the new installer as the flood of
CVS messages demonstrated. As a result PowerPC is perhaps better supported by
debian-installer right now than is i386. Quite a lot of work was done on
general user interface issues. Many issues have been resolved or worked
on.


**BrailleSpeak Debian Mini-Distribution.** The [BrailleSpeak](http://www.brlspeak.net/) project [announced](http://search.luky.org/cola.2003/msg01030.html) the [release](http://www.brlspeak.net/release/) of their "BrlSpeak
Debian-based Braille-Loopback Mini-Distribution". It provides a (temporary)
[solution](http://brlspeak.net/brlspeak-deb/iso/) for those who
prefer installing a distribution on their FAT32 partition without having to
repartition the hard disk. However, installation currently lacks speech
support.


**Installing different Sets of Debian Machines.** Joseph
Rawson [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg01585.html) paella, which is based on [FAI](http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/) and intends to support
installing different suites of software simultaneously. To achieve this [paella](http://sourceforge.net/projects/paella/) uses a PostgreSQL
database to store most of the configuration.


**Sarge Release Status.** Scott James Remnant [checked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00018.html) how
much of Anthony Towns' [release
timetable](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0308/msg00010.html) has been met already. The debian-installer has been tested and
proven to work on i386 and PowerPC already. Package removals also dropped the
number of release critical bugs a lot. Scott resumed with the statement that
we are roughly 14 days behind the schedule.


**Free Debian Logo License?** Simon Law sent in a [proposal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0310/msg00002.html) to change the Debian logo [license](https://www.debian.org/logos/)
which is currently not free according to the [Debian Free Software
Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines). Mako Hill [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00206.html) that
there are a number of problems with Debian trademark policy. This was part of
the rationale behind the creation of a [trademark
committee](http://lists.spi-inc.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/spi-trademark) at SPI that is trying to draft some new legal policy
recommendations.


**Aptitude Annoyances and Improvements.** Nathanael Nerode [complained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00074.html)
about several annoying things in [aptitude](https://packages.debian.org/aptitude). Daniel Burrows [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00079.html)
that he currently does not have enough time to get [aptitude](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/aptitude) working the way
he likes. He also called for codevelopers who submit patches for the issues
he outlined.


**Package Description Quality.** Wolfgang Borgert [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00186.html)
some package descriptions that were not quite helpful such as "Foo is a GTK+
application, that enables bar". He wondered where guidelines for good package
descriptions are located. Mathieu Roy [pointed out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00188.html)
Colin Walters' [guidelines](https://people.debian.org/~walters/descriptions.html).


**License Requirements for DSP Binaries.** Thomas Hood [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg01020.html)
about the [mwavem](https://packages.debian.org/mwavem) package that
includes binaries for the Mwave digital signal processor (DSP) chip found on
some ThinkPad laptops. IBM distributes the driver in a [tarball](http://oss.software.ibm.com/acpmodem/) that says it is
licensed under the GNU [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
However no source is distributed. Glenn Maynard [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg01025.html)
that the package cannot even be distributed in non-free if the source code is
not available.


**Embedded Debian Device won Prize.** The German company [Innominate](http://www.innominate.de/) has won the Wolfsburg AG
Competence Prize, this year [awarded](http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS8505038381.html) for the
IT category in the field of Network Embedded Systems. The awarded mGuard
security appliance runs a hardened Linux kernel 2.4 based on Debian 3.0 that
Innominate developed in-house.
