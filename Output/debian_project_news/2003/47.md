Debian Weekly News - November 26th, 2003
========================================


Welcome to this year's 47th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. We were not able to
produce and publish DWN in time this week due to the security [breach](https://www.debian.org/News/2003/20031121) the Debian project faced. An
interesting [interview](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=5215) with several developers from [freedesktop.org](http://www.freedesktop.org/) regarding aspects of
their project, including interoperability, hardware abstraction, accessibility
and more has been published.


**Debian Servers compromised.** The Debian project had to [report](https://www.debian.org/News/2003/20031121) that four servers were [compromised](http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/files/fw/debian-security-20031121.txt) by an unknown attacker. The admin team, with site admins and
service admins are busy checking and resurrecting machines and services.
As a first [reaction](http://lists.infodrom.org/misc/2003/0013.html) all accounts have been locked as a safety precaution. If the
same password was used for Debian machines and others, you are strongly
advised to change it as soon as possible.


**Testing Propagation Status.** Nathanael Nerode [looked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0311/msg00092.html) at
several packages and their migration to testing and concluded that things look
pretty good actually. Perl and GNOME should be fine after their quarantine
time. Mozilla, however, does not build on two architectures. Several
packages, though, are waiting for Perl and PostgreSQL which is waiting for
Perl as well.


**Results for new SPI Board of Directors Member Vote.**
Wichert Akkerman, [SPI](https://www.spi-inc.org/) board secretary,
[announced](http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-announce/2003/000064.html) that a total of 52 people did cast their vote, which is
18Â % of all eligible voters. The three winners are David Graham, Ian
Jackson and Martin 'Joey' Schulze. The lists of voters, votes and results are
also [published](https://www.spi-inc.org/secretary/votes/vote2/).
After a dispute period the three winners will be automatically appointed to
the board of directors.


**Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 Updated.** Nearly one year
after the last update to Debian GNU/Linux 3.0, the project finally [updated](https://www.debian.org/News/2003/20031121a) the woody release again. This
revision adds 143 security updates to the stable release, that were formerly
distributed through [security.debian.org](https://www.debian.org/security/), and
18 important bugfixes to various packages. Details of this update are on the
[preparation page](https://people.debian.org/~joey/3.0r2/).


**Beginners Guide to GNU/Linux.** Not exactly Debian related,
but Chris Walden released a nine part [series](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-roadmap.html) that guides beginners to GNU/Linux on IBM developerWorks. This
roadmap is designed to help you take the experience and knowledge that you
already have in computing and redirect it to working in GNU/Linux.


**Review of both new Installers for Debian.** Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier
[reviewed](http://lwn.net/Articles/58074/)
the new Debian Installer and Progeny's anaconda port.
Debian-installer is an improvement over the old boot-floppies,
especially since hardware is automatically detected, however it will still be
intimidating for new users. Anaconda for Debian is not yet
ready for primetime, but once finished will be easier to use
on x86 than [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/).


**EU Open Source Migration Guidelines.** A strategic [initiative](http://europa.eu.int/idabc/) (IDA, Interchange of Data
between Administrations) of the European Commission has released the [IDA Open Source
Migration Guidelines](http://europa.eu.int/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=1983) which provide practical and detailed recommendations
on how to migrate to office applications, calendaring, e-mail and other
standard applications based on Free Software. IT experts from several
European countries have been involved in creating this document.


**Distro Taste: If Debian was a Beer...** Indranath Neogy
wrote a short [article](http://articles.linmagau.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=324) about GNU/Linux distribution taste and beer which was
discussed on [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/08/31/0334237) as well. This diversity of GNU/Linux is reflected in the
enormous number of flavors (or distributions) it is available in. The author
would pair Debian with a something like Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier. The
Debian Free Software Guidelines would be a reminiscent of the German Beer
Purity laws, which mandate that the beer be made out of malt, hops, yeast and
water alone.


**New or Noteworthy Packages.** The following packages were
added to the unstable Debian archive recently or contain important updates.


* [arkrpg](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/games/arkrpg)
 -- Roleplaying kernel.
* [diveintopython](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/doc/diveintopython)
