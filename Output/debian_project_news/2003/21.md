Debian Weekly News - May 27th, 2003
===================================


Welcome to this year's 21st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. The GNOME project [released](http://www.gnomedesktop.org/article.php?sid=1126) their
unstable snapshot of GNOME (version 2.3.2) for testing. The miniwoody CD,
which offers a stripped down variant of Debian woody, has been [renamed](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://www.debianplanet.org/node.php?id=954) to [Bonzai Linux](http://developer.berlios.de/projects/bonzai/).


**Donations Wishlist.** Wouter Verhelst [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01017.html) to
create a donations wishlist similar to the one FreeBSD developers [maintain](https://www.freebsd.org/donations/wantlist.html). The list
requires people to state how they would use the hardware. If someone works
on something which is important to someone else's business, a donation could be to
the benefit of both.


**Proposal to remove Mosix.** Francesco Lovergine [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01135.html) to
remove all Mosix packages from the archive. Currently, Debian ships both
Mosix and OpenMosix. However, OpenMosix is more actively maintained and even
contains support for IA-64. It was forked off of Mosix when Prof. Barak
changed the license into a proprietary one.


**Packages with I18n Support disabled.** Denis Barbier [compiled](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01363.html) a
list of source packages that contain gettext files which are not distributed
in the corresponding binary packages. He will continue to investigate these
packages and file bug reports when internationalisation (i18n) support is not
enabled at build time or if the translated files contain bugs that prevent the
translation from working.
**Debian used on Pegasos Platform.** Eugenia Loli-Queru [reported](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=3589) that Debian
GNU/Linux comes preinstalled on [Pegasos](http://www.pegasosppc.com/) machines which are based on the IBM/Motorola PowerPC G3 and G4
CPUs. Through the use of Mac-On-Linux the Debian systems allows you to run
Mac OS or OS X without requiring Apple hardware or a BIOS.


**Interview with Andrew Tridgell.** Alexander Antoniades was
lucky and [spoke](http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=03/05/02/1316220) with Andrew Tridgell about the pizzaware he created which is called
Samba. Andrew also revealed that he only uses two GNU/Linux distributions
regularly, Debian and Red Hat. However, he prefers Debian and runs the
unstable distribution on his development machine, updating every couple of
weeks.


**Retain GCC Binary Compatibility?** Matthias Klose [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-gcc-0305/msg00385.html) if
it is worth striving for binary compatibility between hppa based distributions.
For GCC 3.3 [exceptions](http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java/2001-12/msg00222.html) were changed from sjlj based to dwarf2 based on hppa and m68k.
Since there are no hppa or m68k distributions released using gcc-3.2,
compatibility with other released distributions may not be an issue,
though.


**Maintaining the Kernel Source.** The [discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01334.html)
covers the problems with too many kernel packages per architecture per
distribution. Manoj Srivastava [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01348.html)
that there is a mechanism to specify the order in which kernel-patches are
applied and that all architectures should only provide patch packages. By
consolidating the kernel source packages we should be able to [shrink](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01368.html) the
distribution by one CD.


**Hosting a DebConf in the U.S.?** Aaron Ucko [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01374.html)
whether an upcoming Debian Conference could be organised in the U.S. He reports
that a professor is interested in sponsoring a Debian conference in
Washington, DC, next spring, in conjunction with an international conference
on Open Source in government. Joe Drew [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01464.html) that
there are a number of non-american developers who will not set foot on
American soil, due in part to the DMCA, something Alan Cox [warned](http://slashdot.org/articles/01/07/22/0044234.shtml) about
already.


**Firebird 0.6 packaged.** Eric Dorland [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01423.html)
that he has uploaded packages of [Mozilla Firebird](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/),
formally known as Phoenix, to his personal [apt repository](https://people.debian.org/~eric/debian/). Eric plans
to upload this package to unstable after a few more tweaks, if there are no
objections. The packages don't conflict with the Phoenix packages he provided
earlier, since they were also unofficial packages.


**Debian Multimedia List created.** Marco Trevisani [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01465.html)
that the [debian-multimedia](https://lists.debian.org/debian-multimedia/) mailing list has been created by the lists
administrators. It intends to combine the efforts of [A GNU/Linux Audio
Distribution](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/agnula/) and Debian to create a GNU/Linux distribution for
professional audio users based upon Debian.


**Debian Wiki back Online.** Michael Ivey [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01483.html)
that the [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/) is back online, and
should stay that way. He experienced a lot of trouble with Zope on his tight
server. He finally [learned](http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/05/14/kwiki.html) about
Kwiki, which is written in Perl, and has converted. All old links are still
working with the help of mod\_rewrite.


**NetBSD Kernel Package Policy.** Joel Baker has resolved
problems with the libc on his Debian/NetBSD system and realized that if you
install a new libc on a system with an older kernel, the system may end up in
a hardly recoverable state. To address this he wrote a mini [policy](https://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0305/msg00016.html) which
documents a way to prevent this.


**Donating Debian CDs to Libraries.** Matthew Briggs [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0305/msg00048.html) if it
would be useful to donate his Debian CD collection to his university library.
However, libraries often use cataloging data to keep track of their materials
and this probably doesn't exist for Debian CDs.


**Debian powered autonomous Robots.** The Inquirer [reported](http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=9653) about a team of
scientists at [SRI International](http://www.sri.com/), a non-profit
research institute split off of the Stanford University in 1946, who are working on
robots that can perform tasks autonomously and report findings back to a
central controller. The camera on the robots provide realtime feedback. The
operating system controlling the whole thing is Debian GNU/Linux.


**W3C approves Patent Policy.** The World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) has approved the W3C Patent [Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20030520.html)
based on review by the W3C Advisory Committee. Tim Berners-Lee [explained](http://www.w3.org/2003/05/12-director-patent-decision-public.html) the decision and says that this policy discourages revenue
generation strategies that work by forcing standards-compliant applications to
pay licensing fees. However, the problem with a "royalty free" patent, is
that it can be sold to someone who then charges for it, which happened to the
JPEG patent, for example.


**Debian Package Tags GUI.** Enrico Zini [announced](https://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/deb-usability-list/2003-May/000182.html) the new [website](http://debtags.deb-usability.alioth.debian.org/) for the
Debian Package Tags system. He also created a graphical user interface (GUI)
for massive editing of the tag database. This `tagcolledit`
package has been uploaded into the Debian archive and will be available in a
couple of days. Additionally Enrico created a [logo](http://debtags.deb-usability.alioth.debian.org/images/packageTags.svg) for Debian Package Tags.


**All Systems Boot CD?** Alastair McKinstry [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0305/msg00446.html)
whether an image could be created that would be the only necessary boot CD
for the 4 Debian kernel ports: GNU/Linux, GNU/Hurd, GNU/NetBSD and GNU/FreeBSD.
Many of the "all" architecture packages overlap and it should take less than 500Â MB in
total. This wouldn't happen in time for the sarge release, but once all [issues](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0305/msg00445.html)
are dealt with it should be possible to build a single boot CD that will
install a working system using any of the 4 Debian systems.


**Upcoming Keysigning Parties.** Peter Palfrader is
responsible for the upcoming keysigning parties at [LinuxTag](http://www.palfrader.org/ksp-lt2k3.html) in Germany,
Karlsruhe, and [DebConf](https://www.debconf.org/debconf3/keysigning.php) in Oslo,
Norway. Gerfried Fuchs is also organizing the keysigning party at [LinuxWochen](http://linuxwochen.at/cgi-bin/index?funktion=view&id=100000377) in Vienna, Austria. All parties will use the
Zimmermann/Sassaman [method](http://sion.quickie.net/keysigning.txt) and expect a lot of participants.


**Priority of a Developer over a Non-Developer?** Stefan
Schwandter [found](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01584.html) himself without a Debian machine and had to orphan the packages he
maintained. Raphael Goulais [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01663.html)
whether the Debian [policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/) says that a
registered Debian developer has a priority over a not (yet) registered developer
when it comes to package adoptions. Josip Rodin [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01668.html)
that it is instead a first-come-first-serve method.


**More MIME Improvements to the BTS.** Colin Watson [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01650.html)
that the web interface of the Bug Tracking System (BTS) decodes each part of
MIME messages for display. Quoted-printable and base64-encoded text will be
displayed in a readable form. In addition, attachments are now only displayed
as a download link rather than as a download link plus the full encoded
attachment. The changes were also committed to the [CVS](https://cvs.debian.org/?cvsroot=debbugs) repository.


**Debian Sub-Projects.** Gustavo Franco [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01664.html)
why some Debian sub-projects are listed on the official [website](https://www.debian.org/devel/) while others aren't. RaphaÃÂ«l Hertzog [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01736.html)
that this merely depends on somebody dedicating time to write web pages. Ben
Armstrong [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01670.html) that [Debian Jr.](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-jr/) is a
personal subproject of his within Debian, that received a lot of contribution
by others.


**Packages per Maintainer.** Petter Reinholdtsen [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01704.html)
that he had discovered that the distribution of number of packages per
developer is very uneven. Very few developers maintain a lot packages and a
large number of developers maintain only a very small number of packages, as
the histogram reveals. He didn't [honor](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01721.html) other
Debian work and Ben Collins even [said](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01719.html) that
these numbers mean absolutely nothing.


**What makes a DebConf a DebConf?** Joe Drew [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01710.html) what
criteria a conference needs to meet until it can be called a DebConf. In
particularly he wondered, if the conference in the US ends up happening will
it be a DebConf or not. Andreas Schuldei [said](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01741.html) that
he would like to see as many Debian meetings as possible. David Harris [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01720.html)
that people who can get expenses reimbursed and sponsors need to have a focus
and hence there should only be major events called DebConf.
