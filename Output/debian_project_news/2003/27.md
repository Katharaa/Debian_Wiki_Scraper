Debian Weekly News - July 8th, 2003
===================================


Welcome to this year's 27th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. A Professor from the University of Göttingen [questioned](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/02/0245228) the
enforceability of the GPL in Germany while the German [Institute](http://www.ifross.de/) for Legal Issues on Free and Open
Source Software [analysed](http://www.ifross.de/ifross_html/home1_2003.html) the study
and discovered several flaws. The City of Austin, in Texas, USA, became one
of the latest governments to [try out](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6974&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0) Linux. And some big companies are [collaborating](http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/2229991)
to use Linux in consumer electronics devices.


**Comments on GNOME 2 Transition.** Drew Scott Daniels posted
a [summary](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0307/msg00003.html) about the status of the GNOME 2 transition. Christian Marillat [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome-0306/msg00173.html)
that GNOME 2 packages are finally in testing and that some missing packages
will follow soon.


**Removing RFC from Documentation.** Javier FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino
PeÃ±a [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0307/msg00000.html) that RFCs be removed from packages in the main (free) Debian
distribution. Since the doc-rfc packages have been moved to non-free, he had
cloned the respective [bug](https://bugs.debian.org/92810) and
assigned it to other packages which provide RFCs. For a full list please see
the bug report. However, it seems that some RFCs might be DFSG-free,
probably the earliest. Package maintainers should contact the [Internet Society](http://www.isoc.org/) on their own.


**Debian for non-profit Organisations.** Mako Hill [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0307/msg00002.html) a new sub-project named [Debian for non-profit organisations](http://nonprofit.debian.net/). The goal is to put together a
sub-distribution that fulfills their needs. If they are large and technically
involved enough to need their own server, they probably already use GNU/Linux.
However in day-to-day operations most use proprietary operating systems.
Unlike many groups of users where advocacy is an uphill battle, many
non-profits *want* to use GNU/Linux on their workstations but are waiting for
someone to "make it easy for them." This sub-project wants to do just
this.


**Debian Menu Encoding Support.** Bill Allombert [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0307/msg00004.html) that it is now possible to select the encoding used to write
files generated by menu in a menu-method, i.e. for a window manager. Bill
said that it is very important that all menu methods get fixed to include an
encoding setting. This will allow menu translations to be activated by
default.


**Bug #200000: Using gettext for Debconf.** Michel Grentzinger
opened [Bug #200000](https://bugs.debian.org/200000) and requested
that the package in question switches to using gettext for debconf templates.
This bug report underlines the [efforts](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0303/msg00001.html)
of the localization teams, mostly French and Brazilian, which actively submit
bug reports and patches to help maintainers move to the po-debconf format.


**But which Distribution?** Charles Arthur of the "The
Independent" a UK national broadsheet wrote an [article](http://news.independent.co.uk/digital/features/story.jsp?story=420948) concerning GNU/Linux for novices. He opted for Debian because the
penguin on the box looked friendly, but haven't glanced through the
documentation and stumbled into the text-oriented installer. Oh, and even
worse, a commandline seemed to be a bad thing for him. Maybe Debian is not
useful for everybody.


**Interview with Russell Coker.** Sam Varghese from The Age
has [interviewed](http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/02/1056825450368.html) Russell Coker. Russell is among those who have made a sterling
contribution to the NSA's SE Linux project. Russell talks about how he became
affiliated with computers, his work on Debian and SE Linux and e.g. how people
from the Free Software community are hired.


**Licenses for Documentation.** Emma Jane Hogbin [received](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0307/msg00003.html)
[feedback](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0307/msg00011.html)
that her choice of the [GNU
Free Documentation License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) (FDL) for a howto that she wrote may not be
free according to the [Debian
Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) (DFSG). She does not intend to use invariant
sections, so could not see why there would be a problem. Brian Nelson [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0307/msg00009.html) that Anthony Towns' [proposal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0304/msg00246.html)
views the FDL as DFSG-free if invariant sections are not used.


**Benefits of the OASIS Membership.** Mark Johnson [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0307/msg00006.html)
the benefits of membership of the [Organization for the Advancement of
Structured Information Standards](http://www.oasis-open.org/) (OASIS). It gives Debian representation
at one of the major XML-related standards bodies, and makes Debian the only
GNU/Linux distribution with a voice there. For example, Mark and Ardo van
Rangelrooij are on the Entity Resolution Technical Committee, which is
presently working on the XML Catalogs specification. However, very few
Debian Developers have chosen to take advantage of the OASIS membership and
Mark is raising funds to cover the membership fee.


**Support for NEWS.Debian now available.** Joey Hess [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00286.html)
that thanks to Matt Zimmerman and Joe Drew, `apt-listchanges` will
now display `NEWS.Debian` entries for upgraded packages. These are
displayed before the regular changelog entries, and Matt plans to later let
it be configured to only display news, if the user wants (more useful for
users of stable). The `NEWS.Debian` file is installed as
`/usr/share/doc/<package>/NEWS.Debian.gz`. It is always
compressed and always with that name.


**Debian Mini-Distribution for Diskless Routers.** Vadim
Berkgaut [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00278.html)
a new [project](http://gate-bunker.p6.msu.ru/~berk/router.html)
with the goal of making Debian boot from flash and work from a filesystem in
memory. It produces a boot wrapper for Debian that is intended for diskless
routers. The project features Debian woody (stable) with some packages from
sarge (testing) to add support for 2.5 kernels. It boots in two stages:
first a script from initrd copies the root filesystem from flash to tmpfs and
makes tmpfs the new root, then init runs as usual. Vadim would welcome feedback
and comments.


**Finalising the DDP Policy.** Javier FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino PeÃ±a
[proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0307/msg00017.html)
that the draft [Debian
Documentation Project Policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/ddp-policy/) be published on the Debian website. Noone
has spoken against the document that Javier presented as a proposal and
questions about licensing and documentation seem to come up often. This
would give the document a wider audience, and with help Javier may be able to
remove the draft status of the document.


**Debian at Conferences in Europe.** Debian [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2003/20030706) that several developers will
meet in Metz, France, on July 9th - 12th at the [Libre Software Meeting](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0709-lsm). On July 10th
- 13th many developers and users will attend [LinuxTag](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0710-linuxtag) in Karlsruhe, Germany,
where they will staff a booth and maintain a one-day [conference](http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2003/day.html) and give additional talks. After this, on July 18th - 19th, a
lot of Debian developer will meet at this years' [Debian Conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0718-debconf) in Oslo, Norway,
which is preceded by a [hacking session](https://www.debconf.org/debconf3/debcamp.php).


**Explanation for the FDL Issue.** Michael Crawford [summarised](http://www.advogato.org/article/682.html) why the Debian
community has decided that the [GNU Free Documentation License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html)
is not actually a free license at all, and is starting work to remove
GFDL-licensed work from its main distribution. Such will only be available in
non-free, which some people never install out of principle and CDROM vendors
cannot distribute in whole because the licenses on some packages forbid
it.


**Guide to GNU/Linux Desktop Survival.** Graham Williams book
[Guide to GNU/Linux
Desktop Survival](http://www.togaware.com/linux/survivor/index.html) was [introduced](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=3951) on
OSNews.com as "Good Debian desktop survival guide that covers all the major
applications a user would need." The aim of this book is to rapidly get the
reader going with GNU/Linux and to deliver a fun and productive environment.
It guides him through the many different regions of a GNU/Linux system with a
focus on getting the desktop environment to do what he wants.


**Status of KDE for Sarge.** Drew Scott Daniels [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kde-0306/msg00278.html)
about the status of KDE and its entry into sarge (testing). He noticed that
there are a few release critical [bugs](https://bugs.debian.org/src:kdelibs) in `kdelibs`,
although work on `kdelibs` seems to be [proceeding](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kde-0306/msg00132.html).
Tomas Pospisek [advised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kde-0306/msg00283.html) that
some issues have been resolved, but that work on `kdelibs` is
becoming a problem because of the huge time it takes to compile. He wondered
if `kdelibs` would fall apart, since probably not many people are
able to afford compiling, running, and testing the current CVS version.
