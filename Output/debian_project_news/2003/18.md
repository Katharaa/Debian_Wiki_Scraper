Debian Weekly News - May 6th, 2003
==================================


Welcome to this year's 18th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. As a completion of the [FLOSS](http://floss1.infonomics.nl) survey last year the University
of Stanford is carrying out [FLOSS-US](http://www.stanford.edu/group/floss-us/). Bruce Perens [mentioned](http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-general/2003-April/000825.html) that he would like to see Debian-based efforts (such as Knoppix,
Trusted Debian, Libranet and others) work more closely with Debian.


**Experimental APT with DDTP Support.** The DDTP team and the
Debian-BR project [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0304/msg00015.html) the first public release of APT with [support](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0210/msg00004.html) for translated package descriptions. This initial experimental
release was based upon the CVS version of APT. Complete source and patches
are also [available](https://people.debian.org/~otavio/sid/apt/).


**Automatic Merging of Configuration Files.** Jarno Elonen [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg02066.html)
experimental [support](http://elonen.iki.fi/code/dpkg-merge/) for
merging configuration files in `dpkg`. When the installed
configuration file differs from the file in the package `dpkg` will
offer a merge option. This should help when the configuration file is
upgraded and offers more options.


**Dropping Support for i386?** Nathanael Nerode [investigated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg02112.html)
the i386 problem and discovered that to maintain binary compatibility with C++
packages from other distributions, Debian needs to use the i486 version of
atomicity.h supplied by GCC. Dagfinn Ilmari MannsÃ¥ker [wrote](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg02134.html) a
small [script](http://ilmari.org/sslcmp) that compares the
speed of OpenSSL code for i386 versus i486 on a P-III Mobile.


**Debian Package Tags.** Enrico Zini [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg02167.html)
Debian Package Tags which were created in cooperation with Erich Schubert.
The tags (also known as keywords or categories) can be [edited](http://debian.vitavonni.de/packagebrowser/) online. Tags can
be thought as the evolution of the package sections historically used in
Debian systems. Enrico sent in an [update](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg02272.html) as
well.


**Apt-get with Support for Suggests and Recommends?**
Alexander Wirt [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg02222.html) a
[wrapper](http://www.formorer.de/code/aag/aag) around
`apt-get` that makes it possible to install all recommended and/or
suggested packages for a given package. Graham Williams [mentioned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg02234.html)
[wajig](https://packages.debian.org/wajig) which provides the same
functionality. Rene Engelhard [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg02257.html) that [aptitude](https://packages.debian.org/aptitude) which also supports
this interactively could probably also provide this functionality on the
command line.


**Debian-Lex in Interview.** The Age, an Australian newspaper,
published an [interview](http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/05/02/1051382077620.html) with Jeremy Malcolm, who started the [Debian-Lex](https://people.debian.org/~terminus/debian-lex/)
subproject. Apart from the input by all the developers involved in its parent
project, there are three qualified lawyers involved in the Debian-Lex project,
giving a mix of expert legal and IT input into its development. Malcolm
also talks about interoperability problems with many proprietary software
packages designed for use in legal practice.


**Improving Debian's Reliability.** RÃ©mi Perrot [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0305/msg00005.html) a
discussion on improving Debian's reliability. In his opinion the policy on
improving the stable release is too restrictive and doesn't give the opportunity to
improve Debian's quality outside of security fixes. He believes that as the release
cycle is very long we have to accept fixes on all bugs in the stable release.


**HP i2000 for Developer Use.** James Troup [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00046.html)
that thanks to the continuing support of [Hewlett-Packard](http://www.hp.com/), caballero.debian.org - the
Debian ia64 build daemon - has recently been upgraded to an [rx2600](http://www.hp.com/products1/servers/rackoptimized/rx2600/).
As a result the old caballero, an [i2000](http://www.hp.com/techservers/products/workstations/i2000/summary.html), is looking for a new home. The machine will be loaned to somebody
helping with the debian-installer, the toolchain (gcc, binutils, glibc), the kernel
or some other worthy cause. Interested developers should live in the UK (or
possibly Europe) and will need to supply some proof of previous work or
genuine potential for future work on a worthy cause.


**Debate over Credits in Free Software.** The [long
discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg01295.html) on debian-devel, started by Hans Reiser (and [reported](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2003/16/) by DWN) has moved to
Newsforge. The discussion was regarding the stripping of output from ReiserFS
tools which included some sponsorship credits. Hans Reiser subsequently posted an [article](http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=03/04/28/1859244) about
his position and why he believes that credits in Free Software should be
better protected and enforced by license requirements. [Responses](http://slashdot.org/articles/03/05/02/1825247.shtml) to
his view were mostly negative.


**Software Patents Conference in Brussels.** Jama Poulsen [mentioned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0305/msg00000.html) that the two-day interdisciplinary [conference](http://swpat.ffii.org/termine/2003/europarl/05/) in
Brussels on May 7th and 8th, will bring together programmers, engineers,
entrepreneurs, law scholars, economists and politicians to explore the
problems that the proposed patent law regulations will bring in relation to
the European policy and its goals.


**Debian Subversion Server.** Wichert Akkerman [introduced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0305/msg00000.html) the Debian subversion server on [svn.debian.org](http://svn.debian.org/). Commit access is maintained
through [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/). If you want to
maintain a subversion repository please register a project for it on Alioth.
Once the project has been approved please submit a support request asking for
a repository to be created. Adding someone to the Alioth project will
automatically give him write access to the repository as well.


**Debian Miniconf3 announced.** The Debian Miniconf run in
conjunction with [Linux Conference
Australia](http://lca2004.linux.org.au/) (LCA) is becoming quite a tradition, and with the schedule for
LCA2004 now being finalised Jonathan Oxer [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg02160.html)
that [Debian Miniconf3](https://www.debconf.org/miniconf3/) will
take place on January 10th and 11th, 2004 in Adelaide, Australia. He also
asked for anyone interested in presenting at the Miniconf to submit a [proposal](https://www.debconf.org/miniconf3/cfp/) for a talk.


**Sun Ultra 30 available for Developer.** Nathan Norman [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00114.html)
that he's going to make his current desktop machine, a Sun Ultra 30, available
to the Debian project if anyone can use it. Martin Michlmayr [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00142.html) that
Debian will pay for shipping if somebody in the United States would like to
use this machine for porting the debian-installer to the sparc architecture,
something which Ben Collins has already [done](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00144.html).


**Packages scheduled for Removal.** Petter Reinholdtsen was [surprised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00135.html)
to learn that some maintainers did not notice that their packages were [scheduled](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0305/msg00001.html) for removal. Michael Banck [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00138.html) that
the BugScan mail is sent to the debian-devel-announce list, which is mandatory
to read for all Debian developers, though.


**Speaker for Conference in India sought.** Martin Michlmayr
[seeks](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00139.html) a
speaker to talk about Debian at a conference in India. The conference will
take place in Mumbai on June 12th and 13th and Debian has been invited to
deliver a talk. Anybody interested in giving a talk about Debian in Mumbai
should get in touch with Martin.


**Debian at Conferences in Italy and Austria.** The Debian project
[announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2003/20030505) that it has been invited to
participate in two conferences that are taking place during the next couple of
days. At the [Webb.it](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0509-webbit) in Padova,
Italy, Debian will be present with a booth and several developers will help
visitors install Free Software. At the [IFIT](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0509-ifit) in Innsbruck, Austria, the
project will be present with a booth and several talks.
