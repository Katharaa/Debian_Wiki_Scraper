Debian Weekly News - July 16th, 2003
====================================


Welcome to this year's 28th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. This issue is a bit shorter (in text) than usually because Joey
organised LinuxTag and hence didn't have time to produce DWN during the event.
According to [Heise](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/jk-09.07.03-000/) (German only) the salary management system for the Japanese
government will be redesigned with GNU/Linux.


**Talks during Debian Conference.** Andreas Schuldei [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0307/msg00005.html) the [schedule](https://www.debconf.org/debconf3/schedule.php) for talks during this year's DebConf. Among other talks Jonas
Ãberg will talk about legal aspects of Free Software, Javier
FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino PeÃ±a will speak about security and internationalisation
efforts, Branden Robinson will demonstrate how to manage Debian packages using
Subversion.


**Saving an old Laptop with Knoppix.** Peter Johansson [wrote](http://www.newsforge.com/newsforge/03/07/06/212212.shtml) on
Newsforge that he had to reinstall his laptop due to a filesystem breakdown.
He decided to copy the Knoppix CD-ROM with its compressed filesystem onto the
hard disk. The kernel and initrd files have to be copied from the
`boot.img` file afterwards for use with lilo or grub. This way,
even machines with tight disk space can use fully fledged systems.


**The Organizational Model for Open Source.** Harvard Business
School professor SiobhÃ¡n O'Mahony [discusses](http://workingknowledge.hbs.edu/pubitem.jhtml?id=3582&t=technology) her research on foundations formed around the projects: Debian,
GNOME and Apache. She says that hackers who contribute to the open source
community are often intrinsically motivated. It is important to realize,
however, that hackers are a diverse group. It is not safe to generalize about
all of the values that hackers share, but they tend to agree on at least one
thing: Respect must be earned and cannot be derived from position.


**Report from Linuxwochen Vienna.** Gerfried Fuchs submitted
the [report](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0605-linuxwochen-report) about the
Debian presence at this years' event in Vienna. The first day was used for
setting up the booth while talks aimed at business people mostly. He was also
[interviewed](http://cba.fro.at/show.php?lang=en&eintrag_id=1288) by Radio Orange where he could talk about Linuxwochen and
Debian.


**BSD Glibc in Alioth.** Robert Millan [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0307/msg00032.html) the
start of the [glibc-bsd](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/glibc-bsd) project for maintenance of Glibc-based BSD ports of Debian.
There is a mailing list for general port discussion, and for discussing
maintenance of the base component packages of FreeBSD.


**Decision on Software Patents in Europe.** The European
Parliament has [postponed](http://swpat.ffii.org/news/03/plen0626/)
the vote on the software patent directive back to the original date of 1st of
September. Members of Parliament from all parties had complained that it was
impossible to react adequately within a timeframe of 10 days. Many software
professionals have been contacting their Members of Parliament in recent days
and told them how software patents would hurt them.


**Debian in German Government IT guidelines.** The [KBSt](http://www.kbst.bund.de/), a consulting agency for IT within
the German government includes Debian in their small roundup of GNU/Linux
distributions in their recently [published](http://www.itworld.com/Man/2685/030710germanopensource/)
migration [guidelines](http://download.bund.de/mlf_v1_de.pdf)
(large PDF file in German). Aside from mentioning that Debian is a volunteer
effort, it lists the freeness of Debian, the bug tracking and handling, the
high quality, the long release cycles, and the package system. It says:
"Debian is one of the most stable and bug free distributions. Long release
cycles are characteristic to Debian, which entails the high quality of the
distribution."


**Status of the G++ 3.2 Transition.** Matthew Wilcox [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00106.html)
about the status of the [G++ 3.2 transition](https://people.debian.org/~willy/gcc-transition/).
He thinks that technically these problems are to be considered
release-critical. A [list](https://people.debian.org/~willy/gcc-transition/src-packages-2.95) of packages need to be recompiled with GCC 3.3.


**EICAR Installer for Debian.** Marc Haber [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00170.html)
that the installer package for anti-virus test file from the [European Institute for Computer Anti-Virus
Research](http://www.eicar.com/) (EICAR) was rejected. A native package is [not
possible](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00377.html) due to a missing license, and an installer package for only a few
kilobytes is not appreciated either.


**Logging of Package Installations.** Joey Hess posted an [idea](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00261.html) of
logging package installations so displayed messages won't get lost in the
void. So the basic idea is that instead of using echo for these messages, we
provide some interface for them. Instead of adding log support to
`dpkg` he opted for a more flexible `dpkg-log`
program.


**Packages still using dh\_undocumented.** Goswin Brederlow [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00277.html)
that 469 packages are still using `dh_undocumented` and asks for
people to check their packages. Joey Hess [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00295.html)
that he expects that the list will be down to 50 in one year at which time bug
reports should be opened.


**Managing the resolv.conf File.** Thomas Hood [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00438.html)
resolvconf, a proposed standard [framework](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00652.html)
for updating the system's information about currently available nameservers.
Most importantly, it manages `/etc/resolv.conf`, but it does a bit
more than that.


**Using apt-get with rsync.** Egmont Koblinger [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00462.html)
about his success of using `apt-get` together with
`rsync`. He used a [patch](http://distro2.conectiva.com.br/pipermail/apt-rpm/2003-January/001085.html) for `apt-get` by Sviatoslav Sviridoff. Goswin Brederlow
[added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00473.html)
that rsync uses too much resources on the server side and a widespread use of
rsync for apt-get would choke the rsync mirrors and do more harm than good.
**Bug Squashing Party at Debcamp.** David Martinez Moreno [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00746.html)
that there is a bug squashing party during [debcamp](https://www.debconf.org/debconf3/debcamp.php) in Oslo.
Attending people are trying to fix as many bugs as possible. Coordination is
done on channel #debcamp on [freenode](https://freenode.net/).


**Default MTA for Sarge?** Joey Hess started a [discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00780.html)
about which mail-transport-agent (MTA) should be the default for the next
Debian release. His options include to replace exim with exim4 and install no
MTA per default. Sean Perry [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00784.html) that
enough of a GNU/Linux system assume that an MTA is present that not installing
any would be wrong.


**Summary of RFC Problems.** Martin Quinson tried to [summarise](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg00787.html)
the flamewar we just had about the RFC licensing. The issue here is that the
RFC license is clearly non free. For some people, that's a reason to throw
this out of main, for some other, RFCs can stay in main for several
reasons.
