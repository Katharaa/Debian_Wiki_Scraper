Debian Weekly News - October 14th, 2003
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 41st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. A new site, [Russian
Debian](http://debian.linuxrulez.ru/), has just opened its doors especially to the Russian Debian
community. Just like [Debian
Planet](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://debianplanet.org/), they also use Drupal to power the site. Additionally there has
been a [review](http://linux-universe.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=1063) of Libranet 2.8.1, which is a Debian-based distribution.


**SPI/Debian Trademark Committee.** Martin Michlmayr [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0310/msg00003.html) about the formation of a trademark committee based on a
resolution by Mako Hill and Gregory Pomerantz which was passed by the [SPI](https://www.spi-inc.org/) board in June. The goal is to draft a
new policy on the use of the Debian trademark. It will attempt to balance the
restrictive elements of trademark law with the need for certain types of open
use that are important to community driven Free Software projects like
Debian.


**Debian GNU/Linux the Favorite Distribution.** The Debian
project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2003/20031010) that Debian
GNU/Linux was [awarded](http://pr.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=785) this year's Linux Journal Ninth Annual Readers' Choice Award in
the category favorite distribution with over 7,500 readers participating in
the poll. "I would like to thank the Linux Journal readers on behalf of the
Debian community, for taking the time to make their preferences known and for
choosing Debian," said Martin Michlmayr in response to receiving the
award.


**Ballot for the Constitutional Amendment.** Manoj Srivastava
proposed a [draft](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0310/msg00013.html) ballot for the [general resolution](https://www.debian.org/vote/2003/vote_0003) currently under discussion. Three variants have been
proposed, and hence the ballot covers all of them as well as no-action and
further discussion. The first call for votes will go out on Tuesday when DWN
is released.


**Report from the Linux Expo UK 2003.** Steve McIntyre wrote a
short [report](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/1008-linuxexpo-report) about the
Debian presence at the Linux Expo UK 2003 last week. It was a very successful
show overall which kept Debian people busy for the two days. They spoke to a
lot of people and sold loads of T and polo shirts in addition to CDs and DVDs.
Many existing GNU/Linux and Debian users came to talk or ask particular
questions.


**Language Suffixes for Programs.** Marco Paganini [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00730.html)
whether programs in `/usr/bin` are allowed to have a language
suffix such as `.pl` or `.py`. Marcelo Magallon
strongly [opposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00746.html) this idea and Daniel Burrows [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00789.html)
that adding `.py` to programs in `/usr/bin` can cause
problems with Python's module importing.


**Debian GNU/Linux is the Best Enterprise Distribution.** The
German Linux Enterprise [magazine](http://www.linuxenterprise.de/)
conducted a "Readers Choice" [survey](http://www.linuxenterprise.de/itr/service/show.php3?id=104&nodeid=35). Among various questions readers also had to vote for the "Best
Enterprise Distribution". The winner is Debian GNU/Linux which received 33 %
of votes. It was followed by SuSE Linux Enterprise Server with 32 % and Red
Hat Advanced Server at 22 %.


**Eating Spam and Viruses with Debian GNU/Linux.** Ugo
Bellavance recently discovered MailScanner, which is a powerful
security/spam/virus filter for mail servers. He wrote a short [introduction](http://www.debianhelp.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=3178) on its use and installation. It can also be used in
connection with an anti-virus product. The behaviour for spam and virus
catching is highly customisable using several settings, and the defaults
usually make sense, if one is using a recent version.


**Building Packages consume too much Memory.** Sam Hocevar [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00985.html)
that building [openvrml](https://packages.debian.org/openvrml-lookat) on [arm](https://buildd.debian.org/build.php?pkg=openvrml&arch=arm), [mips](https://buildd.debian.org/build.php?pkg=openvrml&arch=mips) and
[mipsel](https://buildd.debian.org/build.php?pkg=openvrml&arch=mipsel) consumes too much memory so that the automatic build is terminated.
He [admitted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01044.html) that g++ uses about 200 MB of memory on his own system.
Adam Majer [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01013.html) not to use the `-O2` switch for optimisation in order
to save memory on these architectures.


**SysFS - Managing Device Nodes.** Martin Pitt [read](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01017.html) about
the new [architecture](http://archive.linuxsymposium.org/ols2003/Proceedings/All-Reprints/Reprint-Kroah-Hartman-OLS2003.pdf) for Linux kernel device nodes and wondered how to package its
library. A user-space daemon will provide a consistent interface to the
kernel device information file system sysfs and replace devfs. Marco d'Itri
[contributed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01062.html) preliminary [packages](http://www.bofh.it/~md/debian/) for udev.


**Booting a Debian System faster.** Andrea Mennucc [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01078.html) if
there have been any effort in speeding up the boot sequence by implementing [parallel](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-boot.html)
starting of daemons, [minit](http://www.fefe.de/minit/) or Richard
Gooch's [boot scripts](http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/boot-scripts/). Henrique de Moraes Holschuh has been [working](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01080.html) on
the [init system](https://people.debian.org/~hmh/invokerc.d-policyrc.d-specification.txt). Joe Drew [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01119.html) that
he has converted an embedded machine from busybox init to simpleinit plus
tools that support dependencies and saved
some time during boot. Gerrit Pape also [implemented](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01131.html)
[runit](https://packages.debian.org/runit), but it's not a drop-in
replacement for the SysV init system.


**Helping busy Maintainers.** Martin Michlmayr [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-0310/msg00017.html) for a
group of people who are willing to help busy [developers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-0310/msg00032.html) by
co-maintaining their packages for a while. Interested people don't need to be
registered as Debian developer yet, but should [contact](mailto:tbm@debian.org) him.
