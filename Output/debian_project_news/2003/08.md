Debian Weekly News - February 25th, 2003
========================================


Welcome to this year's 8th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. For those of you who always wanted to learn more about
nerds, the most recent [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html) from Paul Graham about why nerds are unpopular may shed some light
on the issue. The Swedish agency for public management has performed a
feasibility study on free and open source software and has given advice to use
free and open source software.


**Debian reviewed at DistroWatch.** Alexander Antoniades wrote
a [report](http://www.distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=review-debian) about Debian GNU/Linux. He did not only look at the installation
process but also used the distribution and learned about powers of the `apt-get` command. The article admits that the Debian installation
wasn't the easiest, but it is not particularly hard. Using unofficial
repositories you can get pretty much all the newest software.


**Maintaining Success Stories.** Colin Walters [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01307.html)
that he is putting the [Debian users page](https://www.debian.org/users/) up for
adoption. He did not have the time to give it the love it deserves, and
accumulated an embarrassingly long queue of submissions. If somebody is
interested, please send him a [mail](mailto:walters@debian.org).
Good English skills are very important, and the person will also need some
knowledge of how the Debian website [works](http://cvs.debian.org/webwml/english/users/index.wml?cvsroot=webwml).


**Debian-Installer still installs Debian.** Tollef Fog Heen [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0302/msg00456.html)
that debian-installer is still able to install Debian. Most of the goals he
mentioned in an earlier [report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0212/msg00002.html) are mostly reached. cdebconf has gotten a slang [frontend](https://people.debian.org/~sjogren/d-i/screenshots/2003-02-16/slang/), which seems to work reasonably well. A lot of work has been
going into infrastructure issues, but more needs to be done. The most
important job, however, is porting the tools to other architectures.


**Project Leader Platforms.** Platform statements from each of
the candidates for the Debian Project Leader elections are [online](https://www.debian.org/vote/2003/platforms/). Moshe Zadka [plans](https://www.debian.org/vote/2003/platforms/moshez) to do as little as
possible but help people do their work. Bdale Garbee [believes](https://www.debian.org/vote/2003/platforms/bdale) that the primary role of
a leader is facilitation and approached this by spending a lot of time
listening and reading. Martin Michlmayr [intends](https://www.debian.org/vote/2003/platforms/tbm) to represent Debian to the
outside world, while his main focus will be on internal matters. Branden
Robinson [wants](https://www.debian.org/vote/2003/platforms/branden) to delegate
responsibility and set clear and reasonable expectations for their
fulfillment.


**Questions to the DPL candidates.** RaphaÃ«l Hertzog
formulated several [questions](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0302/msg00076.html) to
the candidates for the Debian Project Leader elections. For [Bdale
Garbee](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0302/msg00073.html), [Martin Michlmayr](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0302/msg00074.html) and [Branden
Robinson](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0302/msg00075.html) he asked specific questions as well. Eduard Bloch added more [questions](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0302/msg00079.html) for
all candidates.


**Help with Packaging Roxen 3.3.** Turbo Fredriksson spent the last
couple of months on packaging Roxen Webserver 3.3 and is [close](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01247.html) to a
release. New versions of the Roxen Webserver require a MySQL server to run.
He wonders how to handle the situation best. The package should still be able
to use an external database server and not depend on a locally installed
one.


**Ominous Security Support Policies.** An [article](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/61/29330.html) in The
Register caused a [discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01259.html)
about supporting old versions and the recognition of the release process
including the testing distribution. The article complains about the Debian
Security Team ceasing support for slink (2.1) with only two weeks notice but
ignores the [update](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00043.html) sent out later which announces that the support period was extended
by one month. Another discussion about this is taking place at [SecurityFocus](http://securityfocus.com/columnists/142). The Security Team is [trying](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0302/msg00010.html) to support the old potato for 12 months after the current stable
distribution was released, which is superior to all other distributions.


**List of APT Frontends.** Javier ViÃ±uales GutiÃ©rrez [revealed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01319.html) Jeff
Licquia's [list](http://www.luci.org/luci-discuss/200211/msg00001.html) of
frontends to the Debian package management system. The list
includes aptitude and stormpkg, but also apt-move, apt-proxy and apt-zip or
jablicator. Junichi Uekawa (上川 純一) [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01331.html) two
special modes for Emacs. Alexander Wirt also [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01352.html) the
missing [synaptic](http://distro.conectiva.com.br/projetos/46/).


**Installing Debian parallel to Operating Systems.** [DebianHelp](http://www.debianhelp.org/) has an [article](http://www.debianhelp.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=3137) that describes how to install woody and two different proprietary
operating systems on the same harddisk. This can be tricky because of the way
that those systems use the bootsectors of other partitions, including
overwriting the master bootrecord. However, since LILO can boot them all,
it'll become the primary boot loader.


**Linux Certification Tutorials.** IBM has made available a
set of [tutorials](http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS9210834394.html)
designed to be guides for preparation for [Linux Professional Certification](http://www.lpi.org/c-process.html)
from the [Linux Professional Institute](http://www.lpi.org/). The
tutorials cover general GNU/Linux administration and networking and should
also be helpful to those not interested in certification.


**Do Font Names Infringe Trademarks?** Anton Zinoviev
(Антон
Зиновиев)
[wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0302/msg00128.html)
whether his font package might be infringing some trademarks. He remembered
that one font developer was asked to change the name of his fonts because
their use on modified font designs was said to infringe the creator's
trademark. Terry Hancock [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0302/msg00129.html)
that Debian could simply give fonts alternate but similar names, as has been
done by some companies faced with the same problem.


**LinEx presented to the European Parliament.** Last week
LinEx was [presented](http://www.elperiodicoextremadura.com/noticias/noticia.asp?pkid=40043) (Spanish only) during the celebration of the first annual meeting of the
European Regions Committee within the European Parliament Brussels. This is
the first time it was demonstrated outside of Spain. [LinEx](http://www.linex.org/) is a government funded distribution of
GNU/Linux based on Debian GNU/Linux that was adapted for the needs of the
Extremadura, one of the poorest regions in Spain.


**Knoppix for the masses FAQ.** Karsten Self burned 50 CDs
with the Knoppix release and is handing these out to people he meets on the
street. He would like to use additional information to give away with the
CDs. Therefore he prepared a short [introductory FAQ](http://zgp.org/pipermail/linux-elitists/2003-February/005819.html) to include with the CD.


**SPI Board Membership Election Results.** [Software in the Public Interest, Inc.](https://www.spi-inc.org/) (SPI)
has held an election for new Board members. The voting period ended on Friday
and the three [winners](https://www.spi-inc.org/news/2003/20030222)
were [Bruce
Perens](https://www.spi-inc.org/secretary/votes/vote1/BrucePerens.xhtml), [John
Goerzen](https://www.spi-inc.org/secretary/votes/vote1/JohnGoerzen.xhtml), and [Benj. Mako
Hill](https://www.spi-inc.org/secretary/votes/vote1/MakoHill.xhtml). The current Board of Directors will vote on adding them to the
Board at its next meeting. The lists of voters, votes and results is [available](https://www.spi-inc.org/secretary/votes/vote1/) and there
is a seven day dispute-period during which people can verify their votes.


**Messages Promoting non-free Software.** The new
`cdrecord` program displays a message saying "If you need
DVD-R/DVD-RW support, ask the Author for cdrecord-ProDVD". Ben Collins [thought](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01524.html)
that Debian should not be promoting non-free software in this way and that
the message should instead point users to the free `dvdrecord`
package. Andreas Metzler [preferred](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01531.html)
to leave the message where it is and maintain good relations with the upstream
author, but Craig Dickson [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01526.html)
to simply remove the message.


**Debian Project at three European Events.** The project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2003/20030224) that it has been invited to
participate in three events taking place during the next days. On March 1st
developers meet at [LinuxForum
2003](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0301-linuxforum) in Copenhagen, Denmark, where Debian maintains a booth. From March
1st to 2nd a talk about the benefits of using Debian GNU/Linux will be given
at [Wilhelmshavener
Linux Information Days](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0301-infotage-wilhelmshaven) in Germany. At the same time Debian will maintain
a booth at [Chemnitzer
Linux-Tag](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/0301-linuxtag-chemnitz) and give talks about the [Debian Description Translation Project](http://ddtp.debian.org/) and [Debian-Med](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-med/).


**Packaging Electronic Magazines.** Kevin Rosenberg [intended](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01462.html) to
package all issues of the [Phrack Magazine](http://www.phrack.org/)
as separate package. Lars Wirzenius [raised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01472.html)
concerns since this would dramatically increase the size of the Package files
that users have to download frequently.


**Exim 4 Packages in Experimental.** Marc Haber [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01513.html)
that the Debian Exim 4 maintainer team has uploaded the first version of Exim
4 into Debian experimental. The packages will be moved into the archive soon.
The packages offer a semi-clean update path from Exim 3 by trying to parse the
old configuration file if it has been generated by eximconfig.


**Debian Workshops on IRC.** GÃ¼rkan SengÃ¼n alias tarzeau
informed us that he is organizing [online workshops](http://www.linuks.mine.nu/irc/) on IRC. Last week they had a talk about [Debian Packaging](http://www.linuks.mine.nu/irc/debian-packaging).
This weekend (on Saturday at 15:00 GMT) the workshop will cover IPv6 on Debian
by Ricardo Javier Cardenes Medina alias Heimy. The workshops take place on
#debian-friendly on irc.debian.org.
