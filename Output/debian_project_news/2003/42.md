Debian Weekly News - October 21st, 2003
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 42nd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. According to [natural computing](http://www.natural-computing.de/inhalte_d/news/news_sites/news.html) the audit court of the German province
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is [moving](http://www.pro-linux.de/news/2003/6065.html) their 100
systems to Debian GNU/Linux. The Dutch [robot soccer](http://www.ihrt.tuwien.ac.at/FIRAWM03/) team [Mission Impossible
Twente](http://parlevink.cs.utwente.nl/robotsoccer/) use Debian woody as operating system and is very pleased with
it.


**Debian and the LPI.** Martin Michlmayr [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0310/msg00013.html) about a meeting and discussions with representatives of the [Linux Professional Institute](http://www.lpi.org/) (LPI). People can
choose between rpm-based and dpkg-based questions and about 25 % of the
testees in a Sydney LPI lab chose dpkg-based questions. Furthermore, LPI is
working on the development of a "Desktop Certification" and interested
Debian desktop people are encouraged to get in contact with Martin. LPI will
also be present at the [World Summit](http://www.geneva2003.org/wsis/indexb01.htm) on the Information Society (WSIS) handing out bootable Debian
CDs ([Morphix](http://morphix.sourceforge.net/)).


**Project Leader Retrospective.** Martin Michlmayr [listed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0310/msg00014.html) tasks he worked on during past six months which didn't justify a
report on their own in order to be transparent and accountable. This included
several internal Debian activities, financial and legal matters, publicity and
development.


**Debian in the News.** LinuxForce has noted that 2003 has
already become a banner year for Debian GNU/Linux. They have put together a
[list](http://www.linuxforce.net/debian.html#banneryear2003) of the
most significant news stories about Debian so far this year. This includes
the most recent awards, a Netcraft [survey](http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2003/08/16/debian_linux_distribution_10_years_old_today.html), the [case
study](http://www.sage-ie.org/slides/case_study/) in best practice for operating system management and others.


**Package Policy Checker.** MagosÃ¡nyi ArpÃ¡d [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01132.html)
which policy checker should be used since the versions in testing don't
implement the most recent [policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/).
Steve Kowalik [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01143.html)
that [linda](https://packages.debian.org/linda) does but that the
version hasn't been installed in testing yet.


**Source only Uploads.** Wolfgang Borgert [experienced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01226.html)
problems with a source only upload recently. Daniel Jacobowitz [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01227.html)
that they are not permitted because they would encourage carelessness by the
maintainer, since these packages would not even have to be built by the
maintainer anymore. Additionally binary-all would not be built by the
buildds.


**Debian in Wikipedia.** Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia,
contains a long [entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian)
about the Debian project and its distribution. Among other topics it mentions
developer recruitment, motivation, resignation and the package life cycle.
[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
is a community written and edited encyclopedia published
using the GNU Free Documentation license. Over a dozen
people have contributed to the article since its original
version was written in December 2001.


**Mini-Freeze for some Packages.** Steve Langasek [encouraged](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0310/msg00082.html)
maintainers of krb4, PostgreSQL, Heimdal, cyrus-sasl2 and coreutils not to
modify these packages until they have migrated into testing. Several
inter-package dependencies and serious problems prevent them to enter testing
at the moment. PostgreSQL is delayed by an unexpected breakage in connection
with Perl 5.8.1, heimdal conflicts with PostgreSQL and coreutils requires a new
version of krb4 first.


**Constitutional Amendment Ballot.** Manoj Srivastava [released](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0310/msg00088.html) the
first call for votes for the [constitutional amendment general resolution](https://www.debian.org/vote/2003/vote_0003) in order to clarify section
4.1.5 of the [constitution](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution). Votes
must be received by Wednesday, October 29th, 23:59:59 UTC. He [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0310/msg00090.html)
further information, a list of [fingerprints](https://www.debian.org/vote/2003/gr_sec415_quorum.log), [statistics](http://master.debian.org/%7Esrivasta/gr_sec415.html)
about this vote and mentioned the source code [repository](http://arch.debian.org/arch/private/srivasta/archive-2003/) of the vote system.


**Testing Packages at Build-time.** Bill Allombert [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0310/msg00028.html)
to revise the policy and ask maintainers to place automatic tests for their
packages in the build scripts, since autobuilder time seems to be a less
scarce resource than porters time. Maintainers can only tests binary
packages they will upload. They can only test an autobuilt package once it is
part of unstable and is maybe already causing trouble. Such a prohibition is
no longer part of the [policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/),
though.


**Packaging debian-installer Images.** Goswin von Brederlow [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0310/msg00067.html) where
images for the new installer should be uploaded. There are floppy, CDROM,
netboot and hd-install images ranging from 1.4 MB floppies, 5-20 MB
netboot/hd-install images and 5/20/50 MB CDROM iso images, total
100-150 MB per architecture.

that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
