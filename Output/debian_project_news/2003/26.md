Debian Weekly News - July 1st, 2003
===================================


Welcome to this year's 26th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. The South Australian government [discusses](http://australianit.news.com.au/articles/0,7204,6651968%5e16123%5e%5enbv%5e,00.html) a [bill](http://www.linuxsa.org.au/oss-bill/open-source-bill.pdf) that
requires government departments to use Free Software where practicable.
British scientists found out that [debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0306511) in open source
projects is always faster than in closed source projects. Eben Moglen, legal
advisor of the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/)
released a [paper](http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/sco-statement.html) in which he tries to correct confusing use of the term "Linux".


**Abuse of Changelog Entries.** Gerfried Fuchs [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0306/msg00016.html) in detail how changelog entries should not be abused by package
maintainers and how bugs should be closed instead. The general rule is that
if there has been no change made to close a bug, you should not close it with a
changelog entry. If a new upstream version fixes some bugs, details should be
written as well.


**Improving the Debian Reference.** Maximilian Attems [sought](http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=268105) people to
help improve the small [section](http://qref.sourceforge.net/Debian/reference/ch-program.en.html#s13.4) about Perl in the [Debian
Reference](http://qref.sourceforge.net/Debian/reference/reference.en.html) by Osamu Aoki (青木 修)
and others, that covers many aspects of system
administration through the shell command examples. He admitted that the Bash
section is quite impressive. Links to free documentation about Perl should be
added at least.


**Debian on a Dell Inspiron 8000.** Nori Heikkinen [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0306/msg04183.html) a
[howto](http://www.maenad.net/geek/di8k-debian/) document that
describes in detail how to install Debian on a Dell Inspiron 8000 notebook.
This includes configuration for the video card, an external mouse and hints on
rescuing the system from the boot CD. She would appreciate any comments,
suggestions and improvements people have about it.


**Getting to know Debian.** [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com) has an article called Getting
to Know Debian. It [begins](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/1158/1) with an explanation
of Debian GNU/Linux and how to obtain an installation CD. It then [moves on](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/1158/2) to describe
booting and setting up the system, setting up accounts, and upgrading the
system with `apt-get`. The article is suitable for beginners and
includes a succinct description of Debian's philosophy, advantages and
installation.


**Debian Powers 1st wireless DVD-quality Video.** PRISMIQ [announced](http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS8354206794.html) the
release of 802.11a/g Wi-Fi support for its [MediaPlayer](http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT9943738185.html)
set-top box, which connects to a TV or stereo system and communicates with a
PC. PRISMIQ says the 54 Mbps 802.11g bandwidth will carry high quality video
from a PC to a TV, making MediaPlayer "the first consumer set-top box to
enable DVD-quality video over 802.11g wireless." The MediaPlayer is powered
by Debian GNU/Linux, which was chosen for its "quality and features" and was
ported in-house by Brad LaRonde.


**Debian on Ultra 10/Distribution Server.** Guillaume Tamboise
 [wrote](https://lists.debian.org/debian-sparc-0306/msg00278.html) a
[document](http://www.giac.org/practical/GCUX/Guillaume_Tamboise_GCUX.pdf) on configuring Debian 3.0 as a distribution server on a Sun Ultra
10. The document was written for a SANS Institute security certification
(SANS GCUX). It is more Sparc 64 specific than Sun Ultra 10 specific, but
most of it applies to Debian in general. It includes chapters on risk
assessment, a step by step setup guide, and ongoing maintenance.


**Verifying Packages with APT.** Isaac Jones [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01655.html)
[APT Secure](http://monk.debian.net/apt-secure/), which is the
working name of a project to add to APT the ability to verify the
authenticity of Debian packages. It accomplishes this via a chain of trust
which is initiated by the package maintainers and ends on the installing
machine. Isaac asked people to help test and audit the patch to APT, and
eventually to participate in the policy discussion about the patch.


**Libtool requires Updating.** Scott James Remnant [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01779.html)
that many Debian packages need to be updated to use the latest version of
`libtool` (1.4.3-10). This is because older versions use the
`file` utility and a regular expression to determine if something
is a shared library, but the format of the `file` output line for
MIPS shared libraries has changed. Newer versions of `libtool`
use a better checking method, however many source packages have not been updated
and Scott may need to file his first mass bug report.


**Debian and the Rise of Linux.** Slashdot [hosted](http://slashdot.org/articles/03/06/30/0223205.shtml) a
discussion about an [article](http://articles.linmagau.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=212) contributed by Jonathan Oxer in this month's LinMagAu that asks a
question about how the rise of Linux will impact Debian and what that could
mean. It says that by mid 2004 at the latest Linux will be a serious
contender on the average desktop and that Linux will begin to take a serious
chunk of the market.


**Perl Packages in Sarge uninstallable.** Mark Hedges
indirectly [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01774.html) that several Perl packages in sarge are not installable anymore,
since they indirectly depend on `perlapi-5.6.1` which is not
available anymore. Adam Heath [pointed out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01782.html)
that those packages need to be updated for the recent version of Perl and
there was enough time for this already.


**Introduction to Debian.** [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/) has an [article](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/1158) by Jono Bacon that
introduces Debian and contains guidelines on installing it. This could be
useful for managers, new users and other people that may be interested in
using Debian. It says that in addition to the long term benefits, there are
also a number of distinct technical advantages to using Debian, the first of
which is its wide availability.


**More on European Software Patents.** An article at ZDNet UK
says that the EU bureaucrats aren't even [considering](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t272-s2136651,00.html)
the numerous anti-software patenting opinions out there. According to a
well-connected lobbyist group, they have determined there will be patents, and
the only question is what kind.


**Debian-Installer on PowerPC.** Gaudenz Steinlin [wrote](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0306/msg00221.html) a
little [howto](http://www.soziologie.ch/users/steinlin/d-i/) that
contains tips and tricks for using debian-installer on a PowerPC machine. He
includes links to missing packages and describes in how to boot a NewWorld
PowerPC system over the network and install Debian on it.


**GNU Versions of Programs.** Dan Jacobson [wanted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01736.html) to
install only the GNU versions of programs, such as `gawk` instead
of `mawk`, and asked if there is a single command to install them
all. Sam Hocevar [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01752.html) a
command line that finds all GNU versions available. Roland Mas [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01807.html)
to maintain a new task `task-gnu-only`.


**Identifying transitional Packages.** Bernd Eckenfels [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01375.html) a
few transitional and dummy packages on his system, but no common way to
identify them. Aaron Ucko [pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01415.html) to
`deborphan --guess-dummy --guess-only` that tries to find dummy
packages.


**Incorporating a temporary fork of Date::Manip?** Kenneth
Pronovici [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01780.html) how he is supposed to handle a temporary fork of Date::Manip by
the upstream developer of one of his packages, since the new version is
somewhat required by the package. Options include adding the fixes to the
Debian package as well, creating a new package that would include the fork and
ignoring the fork.


**Is PHPNuke free or not?** Several [new](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0305/msg00057.html) [discussions](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0305/msg00698.html) talked about whether license problems in PHPNuke are real
and rendering the package non-free. A [notice](http://phpnuke.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=49) tries to make users believe that the package is still free, but
Steve Langasek [concluded](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0306/msg00012.html)
that the license addition indeed [renders](https://bugs.debian.org/195338) the package non-free. The
maintainer [agreed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0303/msg00512.html) that he would upload the package to non-free, which didn't happen
yet.


**Debian Beowulf Resources.** Adam Powell [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-beowulf-0306/msg00004.html)
that he put a couple of [entries](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBeowulf) into the Debian [Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/) related
to Beowulf. He has moved all of the content from his old "Debian Beowulf
Howtos" to this site for better visibility and long-term maintenance.


**New Skolelinux CD image.** Petter Reinholdtsen [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu-0306/msg00002.html)
that he had created new Skolelinux CD [image](ftp://developer.skolelinux.no/skolelinux-cd/), prerelease 39.
LVM is now fully supported by autopartkit and is used on the system
partitions. Several other improvements are included, but there are still a
couple of problems included that require fixing.


**Custom Compilation on a Laptop?** Johannes Graumann [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-laptop-0306/msg00306.html)
if custom compiling of packages would be better suited for machines with
limited resources like a laptop. Russell Coker [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-laptop-0306/msg00309.html)
that the resources to compile a package are vastly greater than those required
to just install a binary Debian package.
