Debian Weekly News - October 28th, 2003
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 43rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. The [XPde](http://www.xpde.com/) team [discussed](http://www.xpde.com/docs/Windows_Linux_Lookalikes_v02.pdf)
the legal implications of emulating aspects of proprietary desktop
environments. Andreas Steinel [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0310/msg00034.html) a set of pictures that he took at [OpenSaar](http://w5.cs.uni-sb.de/~lnxbil/08.10.2003_OpenSaar/) ([info](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/1007-opensaar)) and [Linux-Kongress](http://w5.cs.uni-sb.de/~lnxbil/14.10.2003_LK/) ([info](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/1014-linuxkongress), [report](https://www.debian.org/events/2003/1014-linuxkongress-report)). Alongside,
the Debian user group in Sao Paulo has been [organising](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01277.html)
a Debian [workshop](http://www.debian-sp.org/oficina2003/).


**SPI Board Election.** Wichert Akkerman
[announced](http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-announce/2003/000058.html)
that Software in the Public Interest (SPI) is holding an
election to fill three vacancies in its board of directors.
[SPI](https://www.spi-inc.org/) is a non-profit
organisation which assists Debian and other Free Software
projects in legal matters such as holding
trademarks/copyrights or accepting donations. November 6th is
the deadline to declare candidacy, voting will run from November 7th to 21st.


**Constitutional Amendment of Section 4.1.5.** Manoj
Srivastava posted the second [call
for votes](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0310/msg00098.html) in the proposed constitutional amendment. All three [proposals](https://www.debian.org/vote/2003/vote_0003) passed the quorum
requirements within the first 72 hours of the polls being open. So far, there
have been 124 valid votes, which is lower participation than this year's DPL
vote (which in turn trailed last year's DPL vote). Romain Francoise also
tracked down a major bug in the [DEbian
VOTE Engine](http://arch.debian.org/arch/private/srivasta/archive-2003/devotee/) (Devotee), which had caused some votes to be rejected.


**Linux Brochure Project.** Martin Michlmayr forwarded a [mail](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0310/msg00031.html)
from the [Linux Brochure
Project](http://lbproject.sourceforge.net/) which documents key Linux information in standard-size brochures
whose source is released under the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). Currently there are
two versions of the brochure: a "Linus" version, which features famous
quotes from Linus and a VLUG version, which has been adapted as the Victoria
Linux Users Group (VLUG) official brochure. Frank Lichtenheld [adopted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0310/msg00037.html)
it to produce a [Debian brochure](http://www.djpig.de/projekte/debian/debianb/) that could use some help.


**How to build Debian Packages.** Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier [explained](http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT8047723203.html) how to
build Debian packages. His article provides a well-structured discussion,
ranging from what a package is to the final steps of building. He also includes links to
other resources, including the [Debian Policy Manual](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/) and
the [pkgwrite](http://www.ffem.org/daveb/pkgwrite/) tool, which
assists in making both Debian and RPM packages from a single specification
file.


**Installing Debian with Red Hat?** Ian Murdock [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01880.html)
that [Progeny](http://www.progeny.com/) has ported Red Hat's
Anaconda installer to Debian and ceased work on PGI (Progeny Graphical
Installer). They are also working with various parties to add RPM support
into the mainline APT tree, to [allow](http://arstechnica.com/archive/news/1067056799.html) Debian-
and RPM-based distributions to be managed using a single APT codebase, and
possibly even to allow Debian and RPM packages to coexist side by side.


**Debian in the World Solar Challenge.** During the
seventh [World Solar Challenge](http://www.wsc.org.au/) the Western
Australian Solar Team [Sungroper](http://www.sungroper.asn.au/) is
also competing for the Yahoo most [unusual](http://www.pcchatshow.com/articles/showarticle.php?ArticleID=142) or remote Internet [cafe](http://www.sungroper.asn.au/cafe/). Onno Benschop runs his
workstation (Debian testing) as the gateway and teams from around the globe
flock to the satellite dish each night to send emails back home.


**Bug Reports belong in the Debian BTS.** Russell Coker [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01641.html)
that a maintainer closed a bug he discovered with a note "submitting upstream
bugs to Debian BTS only slows down the packaging work by requiring the
maintainer to act as go between on the bug". However, Debian users should
submit bugs to the Debian Bug Tracking System (BTS) from where the maintainer
can forward the bugs upstream if it is an upstream bug. Consequently, Adrian
Bunk [reopened](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01685.html) all such bug reports.


**Making zopectl a Pre-Dependency of Zope.** As per policy, Luca De
Vitis [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01850.html) for consensus to add a pre-dependency to [zopectl](https://packages.debian.org/zopectl) for [zope](https://packages.debian.org/zope) since zopectl is required to
discover file locations when Zope is purged. Since the location of these
files is configurable, it would be difficult to discover them without
zopectl.


**Supporting different Kernels and Configuration.** Mattia
Dongili [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01851.html) how he is supposed to provide a default configuration for [cpufreqd](https://packages.debian.org/cpufreqd) which is a speedstep
applet that monitors battery level, power state and running programs to
adjust the cpu frequency. The kernel interface has changed between the 2.4
and 2.6 mainstream line. Wouter Verhelst [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01853.html)
to calculate the speed based on the main processor speed.


**Debian Bug-Squashing Party.** Erik Rossen [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg01911.html) a
Debian bug-squashing party on Sunday, November 9th 2003, in Ecublens,
Switzerland. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution, the Groupe romand des Utilisateurs de Linux et de Logiciels
Libres will lock 10 to 40 volunteers in a large room and provide them with all
of the computers, bandwidth, electricity, pizza, and beer that they need to
work well.


**Debian Installer Packages.** Joey Hess [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0310/msg01291.html) how
the debian-installer is supposed to create binary packages once it is in a
state where buildds can pick it up -- apart from regular .deb and .udeb files.
The two choices seem to be to include all the boot images in a .deb file as
Alastair's original build/debian does, or to create a tarball that will have
to be processed manually by the FTP people and unpacked into a proper
directory. The latter will be the method to be [implemented](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0310/msg01331.html).


**Debian Installer with low Memory Consumption.** Goswin von
Brederlow [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0310/msg01295.html) that the debian-installer currently needs a lot of RAM to install
the udeb files on the CDROM. Large memory requirement would lock out several
machines with only 16Â MB or less of RAM. He proposed to use a huge initrd
which is loopback mounted and an lvm snapshot device set over that with a
ramdisk as copy-on-write storage.


**New Glibc for Sid.** Dan Jacobowitz [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-glibc-0310/msg00650.html)
that there's nothing left in the TODO file of glibc that he considers a
showstopper. Hence, he proposed to freeze CVS on Tuesday, build and test
2.3.2.ds1-8 on as many architectures as possible, and upload it probably
straight into unstable.
