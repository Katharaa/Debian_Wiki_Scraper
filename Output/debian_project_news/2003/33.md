Debian Weekly News - August 19th, 2003
======================================


Welcome to this year's 33rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Aryan Ameri wrote a user [review](http://www.linuxiran.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=232) of [Libranet](http://www.libranet.com/) 2.8, which is
based on Debian. Richard Stallman [said](http://www.ofb.biz/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=260)
he now prefers the [GNU/LinEx](http://www.linex.org/) distribution
over Debian because of non-free software on our FTP servers. There's been a
lot of discussion on the [debian-legal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0308/) list about
the definition of the word "software", with much heat generated.


**Birthday Present: Rescue CD.** As a special birthday present
for the [10th anniversary](https://www.debian.org/News/2003/20030811) of the
Debian project JÃ¶rg Jaspert has created a business card sized [rescue CD](https://people.debian.org/~joerg/rettcd/). Although only
50 MB in size, it contains most tools required to rescue a GNU/Linux
systems, plus some tools which are useful to rescue other systems.
The CD can be ordered at [LinuxLand](http://www.linuxland.de/katalog/01_linuxdistri_bs/debian/debiangeburtstag/framify).


**Origins of the DFSG.** Bruce Perens [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0308/msg00264.html)
that when he designed the [Debian Free Software
Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) (DFSG), his intention was that the entire contents of that CD
would be under the rights stated in the DFSG, be they software,
documentation, or data. His view is that invariant sections in
documentation, such as those allowed by the [GNU Free Documentation
License](http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/fdl.html), are OK for attribution, the copyright statement and license
only, and not for other aspects of the document.


**Public Release of xml-core.** Ardo van Rangelrooij [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0308/msg00014.html)
the first public, highly experimental version of the [xml-core](https://people.debian.org/~ardo/UPLOADS/) package. It
contains the `update-xmlcatalog` tool to manage XML
catalog files. For more details see the draft of the [Debian
XML Policy](https://people.debian.org/~mrj/oasis/XML-Catalogs/Implementation-Guide.html). Note that the next version of the policy will require a
local catalog for often-used stylesheet files, which is already implemented
in `update-xmlcatalog`. Issues or bugs should be reported to the
[debian-sgml](https://lists.debian.org/debian-sgml/) mailing list.


**Open Source good Choice for Companies.** In a short [story](http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/newsItem/0,289139,sid39_gci919102,00.html) by Jan Stafford, editor of SearchEnterpriseLinux.com Debian
Developer Tony Mancill says "Because most open source software is based
upon open standards and written to fill functionality gaps left by proprietary
offerings, conversion from Proprietary A to open-source can be easier than the
conversion to another proprietary product." Tony Mancill talks about two examples
of how open source technology helped two firms he has worked with.


**Continuing the G++ 3.x Transition.** Matthew Wilcox [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0308/msg00004.html) that work on this [transition plan](https://people.debian.org/~willy/gcc-transition/) has
slowed down. He reveals that there are more than 120 [maintainers](https://people.debian.org/~willy/gcc-transition/maint-packages-2.95) who maintain packages that still depend on libstdc++2.10.
There are still 145 source packages compiled with g++ 2.95 in the archive. If
Debian wants to hit this release goal, it's time to get working on these
packages.


**Installing Debian on an Indy.** Jan Ivar Pladsen wrote a [document](http://www.pvv.org/~pladsen/Indy/HOWTO.html) which
describes how to install Debian GNU/Linux on Indy. In detail he describes how
to fetch and configure the MAC address to boot the machine via the network. He
continues with a detailed calculation for partitioning the harddisk. Most of
this information should already be part of the Debian [installation manual](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/mips/install)
but apparently isn't.


**Debian's Founding Moment.** With Debian's 10th Birthday, Ben
Finney [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0308/msg00017.html)
if there was an inaugural email or some other document that marked the start
of the Debian project. This [news
posting](http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=CBusDD.MIK%40unix.portal.com&oe=UTF-8&output=gplain) from Ian Murdock was pointed out. Matt Zimmerman [thought](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0308/msg00021.html)
the goals of an "installation procedure that doesn't need to be babysit" and
a "system setup procedure that will attempt to setup and configure everything
from fstab to Xconfig" may still need work. But Peter Makholm [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0308/msg00024.html)
that at least the "Be warned that it will be rather large :)" message was
accurate.


**Mounting the Root Filesystem read-only.** Thomas Hood [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg00822.html) that
one of the remaining obstacles to running cleanly with the root filesystem
mounted read-only has been the `mount` program, which can only
write the `mtab` file in `/etc/`. If this file is a
symbolic link then mount will not write to it. People [have](https://bugs.debian.org/94076) [wished](https://bugs.debian.org/154438) that `mount` would
follow a symlink so that it could point somewhere like `/run/mtab`.
Thomas has developed a [patch](http://panopticon.csustan.edu/thood/readonly-root.html) for
this, so [did](ftp://mrvn.homeip.net/util-linux/) Goswin von
Brederlow.


**When a Build requires Kernel Headers.** JÃ¶rg Wendland [experienced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg00961.html)
problems with including kernel header files in a regular package. Ben Collins
[explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg00963.html)
that userspace applications should not require kernel headers for building.
Herbert Xu [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg01066.html) that the solution in this case is to include a copy of the said
header file in the package itself.


**Support for encrypted Swap and Data Partitions.** Vincent
Bernat [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg02488.html) if Debian would like to support encrypted swap and encrypted data
partitions. He has [modified](https://bugs.debian.org/203538)
mountall.sh to allow encrypted partitions. Encrypted partitions need user interaction to
be mounted, since the password is not generated on the fly (like for the
swap), so it is only usable on laptops and maybe on some home systems.


**Protest against Software Patents.** Felix Klee [informed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0308/msg00041.html) us
that on September 1st the European parliament will vote on a directive that
legalizes software patents in Europe. If this directive comes through we will
be stuck with software patents in the foreseeable future. Chances of changing
the patent law back are close to zero. The [FFII](http://www.ffii.org/) is organizing a [conference](http://swpat.ffii.org/events/2003/europarl/08/) in
Brussels on August 27 as a last minute protest to raise the attention of yet
undecided members of the parliament and asks webmasters to close their
websites on August 27th.


**Introducing Mepis Linux.** [Mepis Linux](http://www.mepis.org/) is derived from the Debian
GNU/Linux code base. LinuxOnline is hosting a series of articles on this LiveCD.
The first is an [overview](http://www.pclinuxonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=7115) of the CD, which reveals that there are not that much cheat codes
like Knoppix. It is followed by a [full review](http://www.pclinuxonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=7143). Finally, Mepis creator Warren Woodford is [interviewed](http://www.pclinuxonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=7171), and said that Mepis wouldn't be possible without the high
quality committed work of the Debian community.
