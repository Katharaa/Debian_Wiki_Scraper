Debian Weekly News - February 22nd, 2006
========================================


Welcome to this year's 8th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Frederick Noronha [reported](http://www.tectonic.co.za/view.php?src=rss&id=864)
about the Martus project that pits the best of the open source software world
against abusers to create a safe and secure environment in which human rights
activists can record and store data on abuses without fear.


**Requirements for hosted Applications.** David Besonen [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/02/msg00045.html)
if the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) address
hosted application and requirements to provide its source code. Glenn Maynard
[answered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/02/msg00048.html) that the [GPLv3 draft](http://gplv3.fsf.org/) attempts
to address this issue but not in a [satisfactory
way](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00213.html), causing various practical problems.


**Etch Beta1 broken installation media.** Frans Pop [announced](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/News/2006/20060207) that as a consequence to changes to the Debian archive,
most of the installation media from Etch Beta1 are known to break.
The only images that should still be usable are the full installation
CDs. These changes are necessary for the Etch Beta2 release of Debian
Installer. If you need to use one of the other installation methods,
use the [daily built images](https://people.debian.org/~fjp/d-i/images/daily/gtk-miniiso/).


**Device Driver Test Page.** Lars Wirzenius [reminded](http://liw.iki.fi/liw/log/2006-02.html#20060211b)
developers to remember the GNU/Linux device driver check [page](http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/). Basically, the output of
lspci -n is pasted into it, and
the system describes which hardware on the PCI bus is supported, and by which
driver.


**Debian Live Initiative.** Daniel Baumann [reported](http://blog.daniel-baumann.ch/2006/02/14#20060214_debian-live-initiative) about the new Debian Live Initiative which is an official
sub-project of Debian and produces a live CD. Debian Live reflects the
current state Debian, runs on as much architectures as possible, consists of
unchanged Debian packages only and does not contain any unofficial package.


**Team Maintenance for Debian Packages.** Frans Jessop [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg01024.html)
the Debian project to emphasise more on teams for package maintenance than
single developers. Petter Reinholdtsen [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg01565.html)
that Debian needs people working on translations, documentation, testing, web
pages, system administration, press relations and probably more tasks.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.

thanks to the previous maintainers who contributed to the Free Software
community. Please see the [WNPP pages](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/) for
the full list, and please add a note to the bug report and retitle it to ITA:
if you plan to take over a package.
