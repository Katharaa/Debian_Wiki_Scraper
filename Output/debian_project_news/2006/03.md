Debian Weekly News - January 17th, 2006
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 3rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Simon Josefsson [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/11/msg00214.html)
a license sufficient for Debian and FreeBSD for the [Internet Engineering Task Force](http://www.ietf.org/) that releases
RFC documents. Michael Banck [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2006/01/msg00018.html)
the availability of X.org packages for the Hurd.


**Status of the m68k Port.** Wouter Verhelst [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/01/msg00005.html) future plans of the m68k port team after it lacks too many [requirements](https://release.debian.org/etch_arch_qualify.html) for
[etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/). [Freescale](http://www.freescale.com/)'s m68k successor, the [ColdFire](http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/homepage.jsp?nodeId=02VS0lDFTQYTLC) variant with MMU (memory management unit) would boost the
buildds' speed by factor 4 and more compared to the current buildds. For the
purpose of evaluating the possibilities of such an hybrid port, Freescale
offered Debian five ColdFire boards which are currently on the way to the Debian
m68k port team.


**Debian Mirror Split.** Anthony Towns [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/01/msg00007.html) that the primary Debian mirror will soon only contain the [i386](https://www.debian.org/ports/i386/) architecture instead of all, the [amd64](https://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/) architecture may be added later. For
other architectures special host names will be created. He asked for help
communicating with mirror admins and maintaining the master mirror list.


**Releasing Software under the GPL.** Svante Signell [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/11/msg00202.html)
how to mark files in a software package that is to be released under the GNU
[General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)
(GPL). Justin Pryzby [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/11/msg00204.html)
that all files with creative content should be marked accordingly. Brian
Nelson [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/11/msg00206.html) that most of these questions are [answered](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html) by the Free
Software Foundation already.


**Discovering neglected Packages.** Thomas Huriaux [wrote](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/12/msg00023.html) a
number of scripts to [discover](http://haydn.debian.org/~thuriaux-guest/qa/) packages that have been neglected by their maintainers. The
output should help developers to decide which package to help working on. The
list is sorted by the number of [bugs](http://haydn.debian.org/~thuriaux-guest/qa/bugs.html), [date](http://haydn.debian.org/~thuriaux-guest/qa/date.html) of the
last maintainer upload, number of [non-maintainer
uploads](http://haydn.debian.org/~thuriaux-guest/qa/nmu.html) and the number of [release-critical](http://haydn.debian.org/~thuriaux-guest/qa/rc_bugs.html) bugs.


**Distributing GPL Software.** Daniel Carrera [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00118.html)
how he is supposed to fulfil the source code requirement of the GNU [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) when he is handing out
OpenOffice.org CDs during an exhibition. Andrew Suffield [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00134.html)
that the easiest way is to prepare copies of the source and give them to
anybody who asks for them.


**Collaborative Maintenance of Packages.** Following the last
discussion at the Debian-QA meeting in Darmstadt, RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [described](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/12/msg00026.html)
the [basics](https://wiki.debian.org/CollaborativeMaintenance) for
maintaining packages by a team using a version control system. The goal is to
find a decent way for Debian to let external contributors integrate their work
within Debian.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
