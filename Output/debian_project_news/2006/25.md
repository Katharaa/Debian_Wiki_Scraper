Debian Weekly News - June 20th, 2006
====================================


Welcome to this year's 25th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Matt Brown [created](http://www.mattb.net.nz/blog/2005/10/26/lightweight-debian-archive-scripts/) a couple of wrapper scripts around sbuild and debarchiver to
automatically build uploaded packages. Isaac Clerencia [reported](http://people.warp.es/~isaac/blog/index.php/debian-kde-deployment-for-elderly-people-32) that the [Zaragoza City Hall](http://www.zaragoza.es)
has deployed a thin-client solution based on Debian in six elderly
centres.


**Homepage Location in Package Description.** Kai Hendry [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy/2006/06/msg00037.html) that the way URLs are listed in package descriptions is a hack which in
practice commonly differs from the Developer's [reference](https://www.debian.org/doc/developers-reference/best-pkging-practices#bpp-upstream-info). Margarita Manterola [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy/2006/06/msg00038.html)
to first patch dpkg with a Homepage field in order to address this problem in
policy. RaphaÃ«l Hertzog finally recommended this meta field should be
incorporated in a Web application of a [collaborative repository of
meta information](https://wiki.debian.org/CRMI) for packages.


**Debian Community Conference Italy.** Marco Bertorello [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2006/06/msg00010.html)
the Debian community [conference](http://italiandebconf.debianizzati.org/index.php/English_Info)
to take place on the 16th and 17th September in Venice, Italy. This
conference is organised by the Italian Debian community and aims at users,
developers, translators and all those who love Debian.


**On compressing PDF Files.** Yaroslav Halchenko [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg01434.html)
that about half of the PDF files distributed with Debian [unstable](https://www.debian.org/releases/unstable/) are compressed into
`.pdf.gz` files and cannot easily be read by commonly used PDF
readers. According to [policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-docs#s12.3)
large documents need to be compressed, but
PDF files are already compressed inside. Compressing the remaining PDF files
with [gzip](https://packages.debian.org/gzip) will only save about
50 MB while not compressing the compressed PDF files would cost about
150 MB of space.


**Debian Mentors Site relaunched.** Christoph Haas [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2006/06/msg00355.html)
the relaunch of the [mentors](http://mentors.debian.net/) service
that is dedicated to help package maintainers who are not yet Debian
developers get their packages uploaded into Debian by sponsors. The new
site has an improved web interface and several new features that are
supposed to help bring package maintainers and sponsors together.


**Executing System-V Style Init Script.** Lars Wirzenius [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg01746.html)
that a lot of packages still don't make use of `invoke-rc.d` in
their maintainer scripts. This is required by [policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys#s9.3.3.2) 3.7.2 and
a [lintian](https://packages.debian.org/lintian) check should be in
place already. According to the [list](https://release.debian.org/etch_rc_policy.txt) of
release-critical issues for [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) these
packages violate policy but this bug is not release-critical.


**Hardly used orphaned Packages.** Nathanael Nerode [created](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2006/06/msg00043.html) a
list of packages that are orphaned and have less than 20 [recorded](https://popcon.debian.org/) installations. These are
candidates for removal as they have less than one installation in 500. He
wondered if somebody would object filing removal requests since they clutter
the archive and use the Debian infrastructure but nobody cares to maintain
them. Bas Zoetekouw [argued](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2006/06/msg00044.html)
that even if only a few people use these packages, they are in use and should
probably be kept if they're don't have release-critical bug reports.


**Debian Day at FrOSCon.** Joey [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2006/06/msg00011.html) that the Debian project organises a one-day conference during [FrOSCon](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0624-froscon) in Sankt Augustin,
Germany, where it also maintains a booth. The [conference](http://wiki.snow-crash.org/FrosCon06) will take place on
Saturday, June 24th and aims at users and people interested in the structure
of Debian.
