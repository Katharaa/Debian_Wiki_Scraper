Debian Weekly News - July 18th, 2006
====================================


Welcome to this year's 29th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Harald Welte [announced](http://gnumonks.org/~laforge/weblog/2006/05/12#20060512-sarge-root) the availability of a root [filesystem](http://people.openezx.org/laforge/) based on Debian sarge
and a corresponding kernel plus instructions for EZX phones. RaphaÃ«l
Hertzog has the [impression](http://www.ouaza.com/wordpress/2006/05/26/improving-debian-as-a-whole/) that the Debian project is merely trying to keep packages
up-to-date and that the project is not making any significant improvements.


**Debian Server restored after Compromise.** James Troup [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/07/msg00003.html) that gluck.debian.org was compromised. The machine was taken
down for investigation and the system was reinstalled. The
intruder got [access](https://www.debian.org/News/2006/20060713) via a compromised
developer account and used a local kernel [vulnerability](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2451) to elevate privileges.


**Updated Sarge CD Images with newer Kernel.** Kenshi Muto (武藤 健志)
[announced](http://kmuto.jp/b.cgi/debian/d-i-2616.htm) updated CD [images](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge) for the [i386](https://www.debian.org/ports/i386/) architecture for [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) that use a more recent kernel. With
Linux 2.6.16-15 from [backports.org](http://www.backports.org/)
several base utilities such as grub, udev and parted have been updated as
well.


**Old debian-devel Channel on Freenode.** Erich Schubert [discovered](http://blog.drinsama.de/erich/en/linux/debian/2006071302-dd-on-freenode) that the old `debian-devel` IRC channel on [freenode](https://freenode.net/) is officially flagged as
abandoned. After the irc.debian.org alias has been [transferred](https://www.debian.org/News/2006/20060604) from freenode to [OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/) the old channel wasn't used much
anymore. The remaining users in the channel are encouraged to switch over to
the one on OFTC.


**Swap on a logical Volume.** David HÃ¤rdeman [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg00974.html)
whether to [change](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2005/10/msg00842.html)
LVM packages so that the swap partition is created as a logical volume rather
than a separate partition during the installation. This would allow swap
space to be easily enlarged and shrunk using the regular tools when
needed.


**New Wildcard Behaviour of tar.** Bdale Garbee [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg01108.html)
that the new version of [tar](https://packages.debian.org/tar)
incorporates a new behaviour with respect to wildcards passed to the program.
The upstream developers have altered `tar` in order to make it
conform to the UNIX98 specification and compatible with the original
version of the utility. The change is documented in detail in a special
`NEWS.Debian` file.


**Packages to be removed.** Kevin McCarty [updated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2006/07/msg00042.html) the
[list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2006/05/msg00026.html) of
packages that have open release-critical bugs older than one month and only
very few users recorded in [popcon](https://popcon.debian.org/). 15
out of 52 source packages have been fixed and 8 source packages have received
an acknowledgement from the maintainer to be removed.


**Support for Intel-based Macs.** Junichi Uekawa (上川 純一)
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg01210.html)
his effort to foster Debian support for Intel-based Mac computers. Frans Pop
[added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg01213.html)
that some work has already been done on the [installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/). Owners of such machines
are welcome to jump in and contact the developers on the [debian-boot](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/) list.


**Debian Packages for Squid 3.** Luigi Gangitano [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00818.html)
his [intent](https://bugs.debian.org/364652) to package the new
version of [squid](https://packages.debian.org/squid), the Internet
object [cache](http://www.squid-cache.org/), for Debian. It has
been rewritten from scratch and provides a number of new features. The [squid3](https://packages.debian.org/squid3) packages may be installed
in parallel with the older packages.


**Packages Diff Files.** Tyler MacDonald [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg01216.html)
if index diff files should be used for local archives at all. They have been
invented to avoid the need to download several megabytes of
`Packages` files upon upgrade, especially for machines with low or
limited bandwidth. Alec Berryman [pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg01229.html)
out how to disable this feature. Mike Hommey additionally [reported](https://bugs.debian.org/372712) that after a long time
without an update and with decent bandwidth it actually takes more time
merging all diff files than downloading the full file.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
