Debian Weekly News - September 26th, 2006
=========================================


Welcome to this year's 39th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Jeroen van Wolffelaar [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/09/msg00013.html) a bug squashing party to be held in Utrecht, The Netherlands,
from September 29th to October 1st. Manoj Srivastava [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/09/msg00439.html)
that the general resolution on asset handling has passed. As Debian [experiments](http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1964607233;fp;2;fpid;1) with funding, the editor and main author of DWN is going to experiment with
spending less time on Debian. Please understand that due to this there may be
no future issues of DWN in the current form or that they will only be released
less frequently.


**Distributing DVD CSS from ftp.skolelinux.org?**
Petter Reinholdtsen [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2006/09/msg00079.html)
if libdvdcss2 could be distributed from [ftp.skolelinux.org](http://ftp.skolelinux.org/) as there is no
DMCA law in Norway. Holger Levsen [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2006/09/msg00091.html)
that users in countries other then Norway might get into legal problems
if this is done, and asked for legal advice. Alexander Schmehl [pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2006/09/msg00133.html)
him to Gregory Pomerantz, the legal advisor of [SPI](https://www.spi-inc.org/).


**Filibustering General Resolutions.** Manoj Srivastava [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/09/msg00251.html)
that due to a loop hole in the [constitution](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution), any group of 6 Debian developers can delay any general
resolution indefinitely by putting up their own amendment. Due to past
accusations he has decided that stopping this could be seen as abuse of his
secretary powers and asked the project to determine how it wants to handle
filibustering.


**City of Munich migrates to Debian.** The City of Munich [announced](http://www.muenchen.de/Rathaus/dir/limux/ueberblick/175149/windowsabloesung.html) (German only) that
they have started migrating their desktops to a Debian-based computing
platform. As part of the project called [LiMux](http://www.muenchen.de/Rathaus/dir/limux/english/147197/)
nearly 14,000 computers will be running a distribution based on [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) accompanied by more recent versions
of popular
productivity tools like KDE, OpenOffice.org and others.


**Debian experiments with Funding.** Howard Dahdah [reported](http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1964607233;fp;2;fpid;1) that Debian experiments with funding the release managers to
release [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) in time as previously
announced. However, technically this is not the Debian project but this is
how it is publicly received. [Several](http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200609232000) [developers](http://layer-acht.org/blog/debian/#1-37) [are](http://julien.danjou.info/blog/index.php/2006/09/20/334-my-way-to-have-etch-released-on-time) [not](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/09/msg00446.html) [happy](http://alfie.ist.org/blog/2006/09/21)
with the [Dunc-Tank](http://www.dunc-tank.org/) and
have raised concerns before it went public already.


**Project Leader to be recalled?** Denis Barbier [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/09/msg00267.html)
a general resolution to recall the [project
leader](https://www.debian.org/devel/leader) in order to remove any confusion whether the Debian project leader
is involved in [Dunc-Tank](http://www.dunc-tank.org/about.html) or
not. The Computerworld [article](http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1964607233;fp;4194304;fpid;1) reported that Debian is experimenting while Dunc-Tank is
officially outside of Debian. So it already failed to be seen as a separate
entity.


**Procedural Rules about General Resolutions.** Manoj
Srivastava [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/09/msg00297.html) procedural rulings about proposing and sponsoring general
resolutions due to the high number of such resolutions and amendments. Every
proposal must clearly indicate the bounds of the proposal and every proposal
and sponsoring email must be signed with the cryptographic key that lives in
the Debian keyrings.
