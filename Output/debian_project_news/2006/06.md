Debian Weekly News - February 7th, 2006
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 6th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. NoÃ¨l KÃ¶the [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg00077.html)
Debian [packages](http://pkg-kolab.alioth.debian.org/) for the [Kolab](http://www.kolab.org/) groupware server. An update for the
stable Debian [release](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) is currently being
[prepared](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/02/msg00024.html) which will incorporate about 40 security updates.


**Finnish Debian Community honoured.** Lars Wirzenius [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/02/msg00002.html)
that the Finnish Debian community has been [honoured](http://liw.iki.fi/liw/misc/flug-2006-kunniamaininta-pieni.png)
by the Finnish Linux User's Group (FLUG). Every year since 2002
FLUG gives out an award to the people or organisations who have worked well
to promote GNU/Linux in Finland. This year the main award was given to the
Finnish translators of OpenOffice.org.


**Call for Project Leader Nominations.** Manoj Srivastava [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/02/msg00243.html)
for nominations for the upcoming project leader election. The nomination
period will end on February 26th, followed by the campaigning period until
March 19th and the voting period until April 9th. Prospective leaders should
be familiar with the constitution and their platform statements will be
published on the [voting pages](https://www.debian.org/vote/).


**Graphical Installer Development.** Davide Viti [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/02/msg00012.html)
about the first Extremadura development [meeting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/12/msg00003.html) whose subject was the graphical version of the Debian [installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/). An unofficial graphical
installer image based on Gtk+ 2.8.10 has been [built](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2006/02/msg00225.html).
Various usability issues and future features of the graphical installer were
also discussed.
