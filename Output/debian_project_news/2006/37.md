Debian Weekly News - September 12th, 2006
=========================================


Welcome to this year's 37th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Debian will be [present](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2006/09/msg00007.html)
at the [Wizards of OS](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0914-wizardsofos)
conference next weekend in Berlin, Germany. AndrÃ© Luiz Rodrigues Ferreira [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/08/msg00510.html)
if there will be special Debian [themes](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDesktopArtwork) available for
the desktop environments in [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/). Adrian
von Bidder [discovered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/08/msg00900.html) a 16 core MIPS [server](http://www.movidis.com/products/rev.asp) with Debian pre-installed.


**Secure APT Key Management.** Andreas Barth [summarised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/09/msg00042.html)
the [discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/07/msg00192.html) about key management for APT from July. The general idea is to have
an offline key for signing stable releases per release and a yearly
rotating key for unstable. Stable release keys will be revoked by
stable+2, so that updates between stable releases still work with the old
key.


**Alioth Incident Report.** RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/09/msg00004.html) that Alioth was abused as IRC proxy. Upon investigation the Alioth
team discovered that many projects are running custom-installed web
applications and asked the project administrators to review the installed
software. RaphaÃ«l added that a service like [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/) is of great use for everybody,
but its openness is also its weakness.


**CD/DVD Creation Report.** Steve McIntyre [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/09/msg00006.html) about plans to move the CD building and distribution servers to
one site in order to minimise transfer delays. Other ideas include a special
network installation CD that boots on the top three architectures, an
automatic CD checker, and the integration of Carlos Parra Camargo's work as
part of Google's Summer of Code.


**Constitutional Amendment on Asset Handling.** Manoj
Srivastava [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/09/msg00160.html) for votes on a [general
resolution](https://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_003) to address the procedures related to handling assets for the
Debian project. Votes must be received by 23:59:59 UTC on Saturday, 23rd
September, 2006. This resolution reflects the fact that not only [Software in the Public Interest, Inc.](https://www.spi-inc.org/) is
handling assets for the Debian project.


**Using the BTS for License Issues.** Anthony Towns [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/09/msg00011.html)
introducing a special licensing tag for reports in the [bug tracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/) (BTS) that claim a package is not
suitable for distribution due to licensing problems. Don Armstrong [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/09/msg00023.html)
that it's generally a good idea to start with a usertag. This could point to
the [debian-legal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/) mailing
list.


**Status of the Internet Superserver.** Roger Leigh [investigated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/08/msg00483.html) the `inetd` situation in [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/). Four of them support the IPv6
protocol but some of them can't be considered as a drop-in replacement for the
standard BSD Internet superserver. He added that users who are upgrading from
[woody](https://www.debian.org/releases/woody/) or [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) to [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) will not be switched to openbsd-inetd, whereas new installs will use
it by default.


**First Colombian Mini DebConf.** Alejandro RÃ­os PeÃ±a [reported](http://times.debian.net/1015-First-Colombian-Mini-DebConf)
about the first Colombian [Mini DebConf](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/08/msg00002.html) on August 19th and 20th. 14 Debian enthusiasts from all over
the country participated in the event and held a keysigning party. The
Colombian Debian community is just starting to get into the work and held a
workshop on general Debian tasks and package maintenance.


**Stable Release Update.** Martin Zobel-Helas [summarised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/09/msg00096.html)
a stable release manager meeting and concluded that the next stable update is
scheduled for mid of October. New kernel packages are said to be in
preparation, some packages were forgotten to be removed during the last
update, still some files weren't uploaded from the security server. Anthony
Towns has agreed to update the archive software to allow updates of the
oldstable distribution as well.


**Firefox and SeaMonkey.** Mike Hommey [called](http://web.glandium.org/blog/?p=92) for testers of the new
Firefox 2.0b2 in experimental. In other news, work has started on SeaMonkey.
The developer team hopes to be able to provide a full featured package for
etch so that people using Mozilla on sarge will get a correct upgrade path.
He has also uploaded a new [xulrunner](https://packages.debian.org/xulrunner) release that allows administrators to handle the certificate
databases for Mozilla products.
