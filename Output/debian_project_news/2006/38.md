Debian Weekly News - September 19th, 2006
=========================================


Welcome to this year's 38th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. David Barker [thanked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/09/msg00042.html)
the project for the well developed [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/)
distribution. Joey Schulze [contemplated](http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200609102259) etch
to be ready for release already. From Friday to Sunday a bug squashing [party](https://wiki.debian.org/BSPMarathon) will be organised in [Berlin](https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/de/Berlin), Germany.


**Status of GNOME 2.16 in Debian.** Frederic Peters [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome/2006/09/msg00004.html) a status [page](http://www.0d.be/debian/debian-gnome-2.16-status.html) that
helps tracking packages of [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) 2.16
which has been released recently. Josselin Mouette [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome/2006/09/msg00005.html)
that it is planned to push packages for version 2.16 into [experimental](https://packages.debian.org/experimental/) as soon as
possible.


**Report from Come 2 Linux.** Joey Schulze [reported](http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200609122039) about the
Debian [presence](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0909-come2linux-report) at
the [Come 2 Linux](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0909-come2linux) event in
Essen, Germany. The Debian project maintained a booth in the exhibition area
and delivered two talks which were well received. There was enough time and
space at the booth to take care of visitors without many people queueing
up.


**Local DebConf7 Team Meeting.** Steve McIntyre [reported](http://blog.einval.com/2006/09/11#dc_team_20060909) about
several developers having [met](http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf7/Meetings/Minutes/2006-09-09) in
Edinburgh, Scotland, to work out the bits that are needed for the Debian conference 7
next year. The team visited Teviot, the student centre that is planned to
be used, and checked out several of the local hostels and public houses for
suitability.


**The Hurd with WLAN and PCMCIA.** Michael Banck [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2006/09/msg00025.html)
that the current GNU Mach upload has brought PCMCIA and WLAN with WEP
encryption support to Debian GNU/Hurd. Earlier he [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2006/09/msg00000.html)
that the latest [gnumach](https://packages.debian.org/gnumach) and
[hurd](https://packages.debian.org/hurd) packages are up-to-date
with the developer CVS repository and hence include the work towards Berkeley
Packet Filter support.


**Debian Steering Committee?** David Nusinov [pondered](http://gravityboy.livejournal.com/29046.html) about setting
up a distribution steering committee. Ingo JÃ¼rgensmann [considered](http://blog.windfluechter.net/?q=node/134) this a good idea in
general. David [added](http://gravityboy.livejournal.com/29306.html) that the bottom-up structure instead of top-down is a
defining feature of Debian. RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [suggested](http://www.ouaza.com/wordpress/2006/09/04/steering-committee-or-board/) to replace the project leader with a steering board.


**Setting up Subversion.** Bert Heymans [described](http://www.howtoforge.com/debian_subversion_websvn) in
detail the required steps to set up a Subversion server including [websvn](https://packages.debian.org/websvn) with code colouring for
easy repository browsing. This document includes the configuration of Apache
2 for Subversion WebDAV and contains some Subversion test commands.


**PostgreSQL Transition Strategy.** Peter Eisentraut [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/09/msg00127.html)
that currently etch users who wish to install the [postgresql](https://packages.debian.org/postgresql) package will end
up with the older version and asked for advice. This situation occurs due to
the transition
to versioned PostgreSQL packages that can be installed in parallel.


**APT Upgrade Problem.** Ingo JÃ¼rgensmann [discovered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/09/msg00062.html) that when upgrading from [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) to [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/), `apt-get`
complains about untrusted source of packages because signatures couldn't be
verified. Alexander Schmehl [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/09/msg00106.html) that [aptitude](https://packages.debian.org/aptitude)
behaves the same and hence opened a release-critical [bug report](https://bugs.debian.org/386800) asking for a dependency
against [debian-archive-keyring](https://packages.debian.org/debian-archive-keyring).


**Debian Installer Stance on non-free Firmware.** Frans Pop [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/09/msg00190.html)
that the installer team will not accept any structural changes to support
loading firmware in the installer at this late stage before the release. In
the long-term he would also prefer a solution that wouldn't require adding the
entire non-free or contrib to the `sources.list` file.


**Using Wikis for Discussions?** Russell Coker [suggested](http://etbe.blogspot.com/2006/09/mailing-list-culture.html)
to use another mechanism instead of discussions lead via mail. He believes
that endless discussions are more an illustration of the failings of mailing
list culture than of failings of Debian. If each side had a Wiki page that
they could modify then in a small amount of time there would be a set of two
main consensus opinions which would each be explained clearly and summarised
well.


**Debian Boot Dependency Graph.** Petter Reinholdtsen [created](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/09/msg00136.html)
a dependency graph of boot scripts now that a sufficiently large number of
init scripts use the LSB convention. There's also a status [summary](http://initscripts-ng.alioth.debian.org/soc2006-bootsystem/lsblist.html) for the packages used in a desktop installation. Nathanael Nerode
[added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/09/msg00198.html)
that the [udev](https://packages.debian.org/udev) dependency
information is not accurate since a lot of packages depend on udev running
first.
