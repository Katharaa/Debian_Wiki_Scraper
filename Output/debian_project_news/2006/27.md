Debian Weekly News - July 4th, 2006
===================================


Welcome to this year's 27th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Andreas Barth [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/07/msg00002.html) that four more assistants have been added to the release
team. There are [rumours](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg02581.html)
to start a port of Debian to the recently freed [Minix 3](http://www.minix3.org/) operating system. Steve Kemp [noted](http://blog.steve.org.uk/index.php/archives/2006/07/03/at-the-end-of-the-day/) that he has become a full member of the security team recently which
now consists of four full members.


**Python Policy Transition.** RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/06/msg00014.html) that the infrastructure for the Python [policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/python-policy/) transition is
in place. The [instructions](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianPython/NewPolicy) contain detailed descriptions how to update existing Python
packages. About 60 % of the Python modules have already been updated and only
about 100 packages are left.


**Spanish Planet Debian.** David Moreno Garza [announced](http://www.damog.net/20060629/planeta-debian-en-espanol/)
that a [Spanish variant](https://planet.debian.org/es/) of the popular
feed aggregator [Planet Debian](https://planet.debian.org/) has been
set up on [planeta.debian.net](https://planet.debian.org/es/),
comprising 10 people at the moment. More people writing about Debian in
Spanish are welcome to be added there.


**Five Years of DWN.** Martin 'Joey' Schulze has been [editing](http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/Writing/DWN/) the
Debian Weekly News for the last five years. The [DWN](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/) is a weekly online edition which
informs about what is going on in the Debian community and
was first [published](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/1) in 1999 by
Joey Hess. Many thanks to all the contributors and editors of the last
seven years. If you want to help, please read the [contributing page](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/contributing) and jump
in!


**Package Selections for Debian Live.** Daniel Baumann [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg03044.html)
for suggestions for package selections for the three [Debian Live](http://live.debian.net/) CD images to fit the user's
needs best. The small image will contain only packages of standard priority,
and three larger ones will contain one of the common desktop-environments:
GNOME, KDE, XFCE.


**Project Leader Updates.** Steve McIntyre [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/07/msg00000.html) that a new stable update is expected soon which will contain an
updated [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) for the
first time. He stated that [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) is still
targeted for release by the end of this year and asked for help. He also
announced a report about the trip of David Moreno Garza to Cuba.


**Debian Flash Group.** Paul Wise [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg00021.html)
the creation of the Debian [flash
group](https://wiki.debian.org/Flash) that aims to support the free flash [community](http://osflash.org/). For Debian packages the [pkg-flash](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-flash/) project on
Alioth has been started. Maintainers of flash-related packages are invited to
participate in this and add their packages.


**LSB Scripts and multiple Output Lines.** Martin Krafft [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg00024.html)
how to implement an init script which is LSB-conforming and also produces
multiple sub-lines of output. Daniel Jacobowitz [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg00029.html)
to generate totally independent lines instead.
