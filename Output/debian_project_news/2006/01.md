Debian Weekly News - January 3rd, 2006
======================================


Welcome to this year's 1st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Mohammed Adnène Trojette summarised all major Debian events
in 2005 in the [timeline](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2005/timeline) for
2005. Philip Charles [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2005/10/msg00033.html)
that he has uploaded the latest [CD images](http://ftp.gnuab.org/pub/debian-cd/current/) for Debian
GNU/Hurd. Manoj Srivastava [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/12/msg00114.html)
that the debian-private list is only private for three years after the general
resolution on the [declassification
procedure](https://www.debian.org/vote/2005/vote_002) has passed.


**Reducing the Archive Size.** Gürkan Sengün [summarised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00759.html) the effect of different compression
algorithms on the total size of the archive. RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00809.html) that the support of [7-zip](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/p7zip)
archives in [dpkg](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Dpkg7Zip)
is evaluated in order to reduce Debian's archive
overall size. Steinar H. Gunderson [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00760.html) that CPU power is also a major point to take in account.


**Debian Packages via BitTorrent.** George Danchev [mentioned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00190.html)
[apt-torrent](http://sianka.free.fr/documentation.html) in order to
download packages upon an upgrade in parallel. The packages is composed of an
apt proxy and a BitTorrent package fetcher, i.e. a seeder and a tracker. It
runs as a system daemon.


**Report from FOSS.IN 2005.** Kartik Mistry [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00538.html)
about this year's [FOSS.IN](http://foss.in/2005/) conference that
was formerly known as [Linux
Bangalore](http://linux-bangalore.org/) and where two Debian related talks were held. Jaldhar Vyas also
[reported](http://www.braincells.com/debian/index.cgi/search/item=121) about meetings with other Indian Debian developers he met during
the conference.


**Archive Architecture Qualification.** Anthony Towns [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/12/msg00014.html) that decision process about the architectures that should be
handled by the official Debian [archive](https://ftp-master.debian.org/). The main limitation on accepting new architectures is their
space requirement on the servers. Architectures will need to demonstrate that
the effort to support them isn't a complete waste of time. Strategies for
non-release architectures are also needed so that they could do snapshot
releases.


**Promoting VIM as default.** Joey Hess [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00796.html)
to use a special [vim](https://packages.debian.org/vim) package as
default vi. Its maintainer has managed to create a [vim-tiny](https://packages.debian.org/vim-tiny) package that is only
marginally larger than [nvi](https://packages.debian.org/nvi), which
is the standard vi included in the base system. Some [default
settings](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00936.html) are not appreciated, though.


**/var/run versus /run.** Thomas Hood [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00909.html)
whether the Debian system should use `/var/run` or
`/run`. Anthony Towns [summarised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00948.html) the arguments pro and contra certain directories and concluded
that each of the solutions has a degree of ugliness.


**Thoughts on the Quality of Debian.** Lars Wirzenius [thought](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg01034.html)
about ways to make Debian better from a technical point of view. He
summarised several areas where the quality of the Debian distribution is
improved, including using tools with higher levels of abstraction, reporting
and fixing bugs, bug squashing parties, automated testing and quality
assurance.


**Using a moving License.** Florent Bayle [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/12/msg00124.html)
how to treat a package whose license links to a web page instead of including
it. This license could be altered after the package has been included in
Debian. Decklin Foster [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/12/msg00133.html)
that Debian may redistribute it under the license which it has received and
that the license text must be distributed along with the software.


**General Resolution: GNU Free Documentation License.**
Anthony Towns [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/12/msg00115.html)
an official statement with regards to the [GNU Free Documentation
License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html). It's been six months after the [editorial changes](https://www.debian.org/vote/2004/vote_003) of the [social contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract) that forbid non-free
documentation to be distributed with Debian.
