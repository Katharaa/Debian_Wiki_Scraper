Debian Weekly News - December 26th, 2006
========================================


Welcome to this year's 42nd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. DWN is currently not being published weekly but when
authors have contributed enough items because its editor can't ignore other
duties while the Debian project is indirectly paying some developers. In the
meantime Christian Perrier has opened the [400,000th](https://bugs.debian.org/400000) bug report. Jonathan Oxer
[called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/11/msg00008.html) for participation in the sixth Debian [mini conference](http://miniconf6.debconf.org/) which will be part of
[Linux Conference Australia](http://lca2007.linux.org.au/) in
Sydney.


**20,000 Submitters for Popularity Contest.** Petter
Reinholdtsen [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/11/msg01031.html)
that Debian's [Popularity
Contest](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/popcon/) project passed 20,000 submitters. By installing the [popularity-contest](https://packages.debian.org/popularity-contest)
package users
can collect and submit the list of installed packages on their systems
which helps our developers to [see](https://popcon.debian.org/) how popular their packages are and where a need for
additional packages is.


**Five Years debianforum.de.** On December, 20th the German
speaking Debian discussion board [debianforum.de](http://www.debianforum.de/) is celebrating its fifth anniversary. Created in late
2001 by Sebastian Feltel debianforum.de was build upon the ideals and
ideas that made Debian what it is now. Today the forum with more than
17,000 members is one of the largest discussion boards for Debian where
beginners and advanced users help each other in a friendly and
constructive manner. With booths at several Free Software events the forum
is also active outside the world wide web.


**ARM now third most-popular Debian Architecture.** Rod Whitby
[reported](http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS3535328630.html) that the Linksys [NSLU2](http://www.nslu2-linux.org/)
is responsible for driving the [ARM](https://www.debian.org/ports/arm/) port to be
the third most popular architecture among Debian Linux users who run
popularity-contest. NSLU2 Debian installations are easily [tracked](https://people.debian.org/~igloo/popcon-graphs/index.php?packages=nslu2-utils) and make up 90 % of all ARM installations reported by popcon.


**Installing Debian without CD-ROM.** Rainer Dorsch [figured
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2006/12/msg00372.html) how to install Debian on laptops with USB floppy but without bootable
CD-ROM drive, such as a number of Sony Vaio [laptops](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2006/12/msg00078.html).
Debian [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) may be installed on these
devices using [PXE-on-a-disk](ftp://ftp.scyld.com/private/jlehan/pxe-on-a-disk.html), TFTP for retrieving the installation media from an TFTP
server, and [netbooting](https://www.debian.org/releases/testing/i386/ch04s06).
The installer for [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) supported such
notebooks, but the 2.6.18 kernel has grown so big that support for USB
floppies had to be [dropped](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2006/12/msg00088.html).


**Etch-CD with KDE as default Desktop.** Joey Hess [announced](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/KDE_CD.html)
that he has created a special [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/)
installation [CD image](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/i386/iso-cd/debian-testing-i386-kde-CD-1.iso) which installs [KDE](http://www.kde.org/) as the
default desktop environment. The same is possible with the
original CD images when using more than one installation medium
or installing using a mirror [server](https://www.debian.org/mirror/list).
This is because Debian placed the [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/)
packages on the first installation medium rather than the KDE ones.


**Etch frozen.** Andreas Barth, member of the
[Debian Release team](https://release.debian.org/), [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/12/msg00004.html) the freeze of the upcoming [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) release. Packages contained in this distribution will only be
updated after manual approval by the release team. Before etch can be
released, several issues need to be addressed, especially [release-critical](https://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/) bugs and
security support.


**Debian powers Australia's largest Satellite Network.**
Rodney Gedda [reported](http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;55499617;fp;4;fpid;18) that Australia's largest Internet via satellite [network](http://www.nswnet.net/rurallink/) is powered by Debian
GNU/Linux based routers. In the state of New South Wales 75 towns spanning
upwards of 800,000 square kilometres are linked together with a combination of
wireless LAN and satellite based Internet uplinks. Debian has been chosen as
operating system for the network routers due to its known reliability and
ease of package management.


**Debian Package of the Day.** Lucas Nussbaum
[announced](http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=221) that
he is resurrecting [Debian package a day](https://debaday.debian.net/)
featuring reviews of Debian packages. For the beginning the site will be
updated twice a week, provided that readers
[contribute](https://debaday.debian.net/contribute/)
reviews. Interested people can subscribe to the RSS and Atom feeds. The old [site](http://www.livejournal.com/users/debaday/) from Andrew Sweger
was [discontinued](http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200610071323)
in 2004 and finally found a successor.


**New daily CD and DVD Builds.** Steve McIntyre [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/12/msg00006.html) more types of [daily](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/daily-builds/) built CD and
DVD images, including business card and network installation images for
[etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) and [sid](https://www.debian.org/releases/sid/) for all architectures except for S/390. Building these sets is
triggered by the mirror pulse twice a day. The total build time for all 44
images is approximately 45 minutes. Full CD and DVD sets for all
architectures are [built](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/) weekly and also provide special KDE and Xfce variants of the first
CD. Additionally, multi-architecture network installation CD and DVD are
provided for AMD64, PowerPC and x86.


**Extremadura Work Meetings Evaluation.** Andreas Schuldei [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/12/msg00148.html) participants of Extremadura meetings held in Spain as [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/12/msg00003.html) at the end of 2005. The [work sessions](https://wiki.debian.org/WorkSessionsExtremadura) are
over and he would like to gather information about the success of these.
Andreas will collect impressions from Extremadura people as well and will
report his findings.


**FOSDEM Debian Developer's Room.** Wouter Verhelst [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/12/msg00002.html) for talks for next year's [Free and Open Source Developers' European Meeting](https://www.debian.org/events/2007/0224-fosdem) (FOSDEM) that takes
place on February 24th and 25th in Brussels, Belgium. The Debian project will
maintain the room for the entire weekend to give talks and organise developer
meetings. In addition to this room the project will staff a booth to present
the new distribution to other developers present in Brussels.
