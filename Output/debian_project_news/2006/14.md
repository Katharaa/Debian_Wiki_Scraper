Debian Weekly News - April 4th, 2006
====================================


Welcome to this year's 14th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Robert Millan [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64/2006/03/msg00266.html)
that he has built a CD installer image for GNU/kFreeBSD on [AMD64](https://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/). Joey Schulze earlier [announced](http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200603121801) that the
changelog files have been regenerated on the new [packages.debian.org](https://packages.debian.org/) system.


**Moving GFDL Documentation to non-free.** After the Debian
Project [decided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00012.html) upon the freeness of documentation released under the GNU Free
Documentation [license](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html)
(GFDL), JÃ©rÃ´me Marant [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg01061.html) about the best way to move non-free parts from his emacs package
to non-free. JÃ¶rg Jaspert [answered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg01072.html) that the source tarball has to be split into two parts and that the
free source package should not be renamed.


**Debian Project Leader Election.** Manoj Srivastava [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/04/msg00000.html) for votes for the third time for this year's project leader [election](https://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_002). Debian developers can cast
their ballots until April 8th and may base their decision on the [platforms](https://www.debian.org/vote/2006/platforms/) of the leader
candidates.


**Extending Voting Privileges?** Clytie Siddall [complained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2006/04/msg00007.html)
about the fact that only Debian developers are eligible to cast a ballot for
the project leader election. Mako Hill would also [like](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2006/04/msg00043.html) to
see those who have made long-term, sustained, and significant contributions to
be recognised more significantly, maybe through a new enfranchised category of
contributor. Wouter Verhelst [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2006/04/msg00027.html)
that the major problem is the proper identification of regularly contributors.


**DFSG-Free IETF License.** Simon Josefsson [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/02/msg00389.html)
if the proposed license of a recently approved IETF document that contains
reference code for SHA-2 is sufficiently free according to Debian's [guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) (DFSG). Steve
Langasek [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/02/msg00390.html) that the license grants permission to use, copy, redistribute and
create derivative works which makes it clearly DFSG-compliant.


**Oracle Repository for Debian.** Frits Hoogland [reported](http://frits.homelinux.com/wordpress/?p=9) about Oracle's
[apt repository](http://oss.oracle.com/debian/) containing
Oracle Express Edition. Since the Oracle database is an important part of the
infrastructure of many companies, this repository simplifies deployment of
Debian based database servers in these environments. At this time, the
repository supports Debian unstable (sid) only.


**Debian Conference Video License.** Holger Levsen [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/03/msg00076.html) to apply the "by attribution" [license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/scotland/),
version 2.5, with the changes for Scottish legislation for past and future
conference videos instead of a MIT-style license. Don Armstrong [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/03/msg00086.html) to postpone any move from a non-controversially DFSG free
license to one that is controversial until these issues are dealt with.


**Freeness of the NDIS Wrapper.** Robert Millan [claimed](https://bugs.debian.org/353277) that the [ndiswrapper](https://packages.debian.org/ndiswrapper) [belongs](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg00585.html)
in the contrib section instead of main since its purpose is to run non-free
drivers. The only [free](http://cipe-win32.sourceforge.net/) one
is a port of the Linux driver. Michael Poole, however, [compared](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg00593.html)
the situation with another package that is useless on its own but require
input from third parties.


**Testing Sarge to Etch Upgrades.** Lars Wirzenius [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2006/03/msg00081.html)
about his effort to test the upgrade path from [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) to [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/). This test basically went fine. RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2006/03/msg00087.html) that
tests to install all packages which are listed in a particular task and then
to upgrade them should be included as well.
