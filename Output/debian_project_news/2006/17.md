Debian Weekly News - April 25th, 2006
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 17th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. The Debian Live Initiative that aims to produce a pure
Debian live CD summarises links to mailing lists, ISO images and other
resources on their [website](http://live.debian.net/). AnÃ­bal
Monsalve Salazar is [soliciting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00733.html) ASCII armoured public keys for the keysigning [party](https://debconf.org/ksp/ksp-dc6.html) at the upcoming [Debian Conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0514-debconf).


**Using Alioth for Packaging.** RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [provided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/04/msg00013.html) [documentation](https://wiki.debian.org/AliothPackagingProject) on maintaining Debian packages via [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/). For single packages the [collab-maint](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/collab-maint/)
project is probably sufficient. Maintaining a set of related packages is best
done by a new dedicated project and Subversion configured to send commit
notifications to the package tracking system.


**Google Summer of Code 2006.** Google is organising a [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) event like last year.
This is a program where Google sponsors the creation and future development of
open source software. Petter Reinholdtsen [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/04/msg00259.html)
whether Debian should participate and set up an Wiki [page](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2006) were ideas for
Debian-related projects are collected. Anthony Towns [approved](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/04/msg00282.html)
this and applied for the Debian project.


**Debian from Scratch.** John Goerzen [informed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00633.html)
about the availability of a new release of the Debian From Scratch [CD](https://people.debian.org/~jgoerzen/dfs/). With this CD it is
possible to install a Debian system in a Gentoo fashioned manner by
compiling the programs just before installing them. This CD also offers
a fully functional rescue system with a lot of filesystem tools,
backup and repair utilities, administrative tools and so on.


**Upgrade Conflict: Kernel and GRUB.** Bastian Blank [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/04/msg00081.html) anticipated problems with regards to the kernel and [grub](https://packages.debian.org/grub) when upgrading from [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) to [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) since the new [kernel-package](https://packages.debian.org/kernel-package) [utilises](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/04/msg00084.html) [debconf](https://packages.debian.org/debconf) for user
interaction. He asserted that grub needs to be updated before the kernel
image.


**Properly Closing old resolved Bug Reports.** Adam Majer [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00145.html) if it is appropriate to close old resolved bugs with the most
recent changelog entry if they were fixed with an older upload already.
Matthew Palmer [confirmed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00146.html) that a changelog entry should only document the changes and
resolved bugs in this particular upload.


**Removing Mozilla.** Andreas Metzler [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/04/msg00133.html) that current release of Mozilla is the last and that it isn't
supported upstream anymore. Hence, it should be [removed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/04/msg00151.html) from the Debian distribution as well. All functionality that is
needed to embed gecko and friends has been moved to [xulrunner](https://packages.debian.org/xulrunner) on which these
packages should depend upon. The interface shouldn't have changed, so that
the conversion should be fairly simple.


**Project Leader Bits.** Anthony Towns [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/04/msg00015.html) that he has added Steve McIntyre as "Second In Charge" to share
some of the regular project leader responsibilities. Manoj Srivastava has
kindly agreed to continue as project secretary for another year, and is eager
to do some more work on the devotee scripts.


**AMD64 added to the Etch.** Anthony Towns [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/04/msg00011.html) that the [AMD64](https://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/) architecture
has been added to the [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) release.
It should be possible to bootstrap this architecture at this point and it
only lacks X. From now on developers with AMD64 machines are able to
upload new versions of their packages built locally. AMD64 is also now
included in the [buildd](https://buildd.debian.org/) [graphs](https://buildd.debian.org/stats/graph-week-big.png).
