Debian Weekly News - September 5th, 2006
========================================


Welcome to this year's 36th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Alexander Sack [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/08/msg00286.html)
for people to test upcoming security updates to the Mozilla packages for
sarge. Ben Hutchings has managed to [upload](http://womble2.livejournal.com/57100.html) the final files
for DebConf session videos. Three documentary videos filmed by Biella Coleman
will follow later.


**Etch Release Advertisement.** Gustavo Franco [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2006/07/msg00049.html)
to ask for donations specific for a release advertisement. Joey Schulze [raised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2006/08/msg00092.html)
some questions to get a clearer picture. The goal is to publish
advertisements in large newspapers and magazines to get a press coverage like
the past Firefox [campaign](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node/4611).


**New Tcl/Tk Team.** Chris Waters [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/08/msg00016.html) the foundation of the Tcl/Tk team to co-maintain Tcl/Tk and some
of its add-ons. To accomplish this he has created a [project](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-tcltk/) on [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/) and set up a [mailing
list](https://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/pkg-tcltk-devel) for discussing Debian's Tcl/Tk infrastructure and policy.


**Automatic Building of Packages.** Matej Cepl [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/08/msg00301.html)
to delete all developer-supplied binary packages and recompile the source
packages by a [build daemon](https://www.debian.org/devel/buildd/) so that
potentially build errors caused by a broken environment are avoided. Sven
Luther [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/08/msg00305.html) that this feature has been disabled because packages had been
uploaded that hadn't even been compiled on the developer's machine.


**Swiss Bug Squashing Party.** Martin Krafft [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/09/msg00001.html) a one-day bug squashing [party](https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/ch/Marathon) in
ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland on Saturday, September 9th, sponsored by
/ch/open, Google, and the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of
the University of ZÃ¼rich. The second bug squashing party will take place on
October 6th to 8th at the same location.


**Permission for Quotes.** Sebastian Wangnick [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/09/msg00001.html)
if citing small portions of text or code is allowed without asking for
permission and with ignoring a potential license and presumed that quoting as
an illustration or explanation is allowed by German [copyright](http://www.sakowski.de/skripte/urheber2.html) but using
foreign code as a mandatory element in the software would not be OK.
Michael Poole [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/09/msg00003.html)
that including a section of code containing creative expression for functional
purposes rather than teaching, commentary, or similar purposes is not fair
practice.


**Package Archive Improvements.** Anthony Towns [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/08/msg00413.html)
that future improvements of the archive software will permit packages to be
installed directly into the archive. This will remove the `accepted`
queue and allow more than one daily archive reorganisation and mirror push.
However, this will also remove the chance to delete a package from the queue
before it gets installed which was [necessary](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/08/msg00425.html)
four times during past years.


**Bug Squashing Marathon.** Martin Zobel-Helas sent a [reminder](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/09/msg00003.html) about the bug squashing [party](https://wiki.debian.org/BSPMarathon) in Vienna, Austria, at
September 8th to 10th and explained the process. The RC bug squashing [howto](https://people.debian.org/~vorlon/rc-bugsquashing.html) by
Steve Langasek gives a good introduction and is probably a must-read for
beginners. He also added a lot of tasks everybody could do to help Debian
move forward with the release of [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/).


**New CD Writing Tools.** JÃ¶rg Jaspert [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/09/msg00002.html) for testers of the new `cdrkit` package and the new [wodim](https://packages.debian.org/wodim) program. They will be
shipped with [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) and replace the old
`cdrtools` collection. This [fork](https://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/debburn) is the result of several
nearly endless discussions about incompatible licenses used by upstream which not
only Debian suffered from. Other vendors are invited to participate in this
[effort](https://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/debburn) as well.
