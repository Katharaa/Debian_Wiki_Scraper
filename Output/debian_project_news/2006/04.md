Debian Weekly News - January 24th, 2006
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 4th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. The Debian listmasters have decided to [revoke](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/01/msg00012.html) posting permission to a developer centric announce list for a
person [pointing out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/01/msg00009.html) that off-topic [mails](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/01/msg00008.html) should be sent elsewhere in a rather sarcastic and potentially
offensive fashion.


**Helping the Debian GNOME Team.** Josselin Mouette [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome/2006/01/msg00037.html)
for help with bug triage from Debian GNOME users in order to clean up the
large number of bugs that currently clutter the BTS on GNOME Team packages.
Interested parties should find packages needing attention using
the [package tracking system](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=pkg-gnome-maintainers@lists.alioth.debian.org).
He also noted that those familiar with GNOME packages are welcome to
join the team itself.


**Debian on LVM2 on RAID.** Emidio Planamente wrote a [document](http://emidio.planamente.ch/pages/linux_howto_root_lvm_raid.php)
that describes how to install Debian [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) on a logical volume (LV) that resides on a number of disks merged
together with RAID. The `/boot` directory that contains the
initial ram-disk and the kernel needs to be outside of the LVM, though.


**Kaffe Compiler Transition.** Wolfgang Baer [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/01/msg00151.html)
new kaffe packages that use [ecj](https://packages.debian.org/ecj)
as their default compiler which has been discussed with upstream and other
Debian Java maintainers at the [Linux developers meeting](http://meeting.ffis.de/Oldenburg2005/) in
Oldenburg. This [transition](https://wiki.debian.org/Java/KaffeTransition) affects about 110 source package of which only five fail to
build and need a little care.


**Web Forums for Debian.** Andreas Schuldei [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/01/msg00225.html)
that Debian is weak in forum based support structures. Steve Langasek [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/01/msg00226.html)
that most people in the Debian community despise web forums. Michael Banck [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/01/msg00233.html)
that Debian should be very careful whether it officially adopts a web
forum as part of its support facilities and that the project will have to be
present and mediate when needed.


**Translated Copyright Notice.** Tobias Toedter [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00197.html)
if he should translate the [GNU
GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) copyright notice when it is presented via [gettext](https://packages.debian.org/gettext). While it seems to be
better to leave the license itself [untranslated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00201.html) the copyright notice may be translated as Henning Makholm [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00208.html).


**Draft GPLv3 released.** Don Armstrong [published](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00210.html)
the draft license of the [GNU GPL version 3](http://gplv3.fsf.org/)
that was released at the [GPLv3 launch conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0116-gplv3launch). It contains a special paragraph about digital
restriction management and explicitly outlaws to sue others for patent
infringement when the software is released under this license.


**Debian Architecture Qualification.** Anthony Towns [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00000.html)
[alpha](https://www.debian.org/ports/alpha/), [amd64](https://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/), [hppa](https://www.debian.org/ports/hppa/), [i386](https://www.debian.org/ports/i386/), [ia64](https://www.debian.org/ports/ia64/),
[mips](https://www.debian.org/ports/mips/), [mipsel](https://www.debian.org/ports/mipsel/) and [powerpc](https://www.debian.org/ports/powerpc/) as release
architectures and provided the [log](https://wiki.debian.org/IRC/debian-tech/Logs/20051230-archivequalification) of the IRC conference with regards to architecture qualification for
the Debian [archive](http://ftp.debian.org/).


**Treating Paper Copies.** Frank KÃ¼ster [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00308.html)
whether a printed version of a document released under the [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) would be "object code" as
treated in section 3 of the license. Jeremy Hankins [affirmed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00310.html)
this and referred to a lawyer. Nathanael Nerode [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00334.html)
that the [GPLv3](http://gplv3.fsf.org/) says that object code means
any non-source version of a work.


**Non-free Non-code?** In light of the current debate on the
upcoming [general resolution](https://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001) Gerfried
Fuchs [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00333.html) about graphics in a free package that were rendered by non-free
software and about the Debian [logo](https://www.debian.org/logos/) whose license
is non-free as well. As a result a lot of packages would have to be moved to
non-free.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.

**New or Noteworthy Packages.** Due to [packages.debian.org](https://packages.debian.org/) being down because
of performance issues we are unable to provide the regular list of new
packages.


**Orphaned Packages.** 27 packages were orphaned this week and
require a new maintainer. This makes a total of 202 orphaned packages. Many
thanks to the previous maintainers who contributed to the Free Software
community. Please see the [WNPP pages](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/) for
the full list, and please add a note to the bug report and retitle it to ITA:
