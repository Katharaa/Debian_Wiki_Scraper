Debian Weekly News - May 30th, 2006
===================================


Welcome to this year's 22nd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Joey Hess has produced a [detailed explanation](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt) and HOWTO for
secure apt in Debian. Martin Michlmayr [reported](http://www.cyrius.com/journal/travel/crazy-fosdem) about
this year's [FOSDEM](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0225-fosdem) event and
noted that there seems to be a six month delay before a new applicant is
assigned an Application Manager which hinders the big-endian ARM port.


**Creating a Debian Layout for Desktops.** Luis Matos [asked](https://bugs.debian.org/368594) for a Debian theme layout to
[improve](https://lists.debian.org/debian-desktop/2006/05/msg00007.html) the [user
experience](https://bugs.debian.org/288393) of the Debian desktop. The theme should include a background
image, splash screens and [icons](https://bugs.debian.org/368599). He also proposed a guided
contest to be organised.


**Debian IRC moving to OFTC.** Steve McIntyre [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/05/msg00012.html) that the Debian project will move the Alias
`irc.debian.org` over to the [Open
and Free Technology Community](http://www.oftc.net/) (OFTC) network on June 4th, since many
discussions have been moved to OFTC already. OFTC is also a sister
organisation of Debian, as both are supported and represented by [Software in the Public Interest, Inc](https://www.spi-inc.org/).
The Debian project has been using the [Freenode](https://freenode.net/) IRC network for many years.


**Debian Projects accepted for Summer of Code.** Baruch Even
[reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/05/msg00263.html) that nine Debian projects have been accepted for Google's [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/). The plan is that
students who have a blog or set up one for the Summer of Code will be added to
[Planet Debian](https://planet.debian.org/) so everyone can follow
their progress on their quest to help Debian improve.


**Optimising the Boot Time.** Margarita Manterola [gave](https://debconf6.debconf.org/comas/general/proposals/77)
a talk at [DebConf6](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0514-debconf) about
possible improvements to the booting of Debian systems.
From her conclusions and audiences remarks,
she [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg02063.html) if init scripts could use [dash](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/shells/dash) instead of
bash (it saves a 10 % of boot time) and [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg02081.html)
about the necessity of running `depmod` at boot-time. As a result,
Marco d'Itri [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg02487.html) to remove `depmod` from the [module-init-tools](https://packages.debian.org/module-init-tools) init
script.


**Supporting Solaris/i386.** Erast Benson [provided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00064.html)
a patch for [dpkg](https://packages.debian.org/dpkg) to support a
Solaris-based system since [Sun Microsystems
Inc.](http://www.sun.com/) has opened up its kernel. In response Josselin Mouette [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00067.html)
whether the legal situation of dpkg being linked with a GPL-incompatible C
library has been fixed. Russ Allbery [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00081.html)
that the special exception of the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) that allows linking
and distribution against a GPL-incompatible library only applies if the
binaries are not accompanied with the operating system itself.


**Debian Project at FrOSCon.** Martin Zobel-Helas [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2006/05/msg00009.html)
that the Debian project will be participating in the [Free and Open Source Conference](http://www.froscon.org/wiki/FrOSCon)
(FrOSCon) to be held on the 24th and 25th of June in Sankt Augustin
(Germany). On the 24th there will be a Debian sub-conference. Martin is
seeking speakers who want to deliver talks about Debian itself and Debian
technologies in particular.


**Creative Commons 3.0 License Suite Draft.** Evan Prodromou [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/05/msg00102.html)
that there is a [public draft](http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-licenses/2006-May/003557.html) of the [Creative
Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/) 3.0 license suite. Evan asserted that the main changes to these
licenses have been to bring them in line with the [DFSG](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) and to make at least the Attribution and
Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 licenses compatible with the DFSG and
acceptable for Debian.


**Bug Squashing Marathon.** Martin Zoble-Helas [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/05/msg00014.html) three bug squashing [parties](https://wiki.debian.org/BSPMarathon) with particular
themes to be organised this fall in order to help the release of [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/). In August the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) shall be tested
and bugs in the installation process shall be fixed. In September upgrades
from pre-release etch and sarge are to be reviewed and remaining bugs shall be
fixed. In October the remaining bugs in core packages shall be fixed. He is
seeking [hosting](https://wiki.debian.org/HostingBSP) for at least
two of these parties.


**Release Goals for Etch.** Andreas Barth [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/05/msg00015.html) changes in the release plan for [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/). Approved release goals are the use of
GCC 4.1, LSB 3.1 compatibility, SELinux support, pervasive IPv6 and large file
support and a new Python framework. June 15th is the last chance to switch to
GCC 4.1 and Python 2.4, and on July 30th the essential toolchain and the
kernel are to be frozen in order to be able to release in December.
