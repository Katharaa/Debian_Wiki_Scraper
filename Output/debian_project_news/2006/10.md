Debian Weekly News - March 7th, 2006
====================================


Welcome to this year's 10th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. If you are in doubt about the proper distribution for
you, try the [Linux
distribution chooser](http://www.zegeniestudios.net/ldc/index.php?firsttime=true). Manoj Srivastava [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/03/msg00074.html)
for [votes](https://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001) on the General Resolution
to address the Debian project's position on the [GNU Free Documentation License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html)
a second time. Ballots can be casted until March 11th.


**Requirements and Rights for Sub-Projects.** Martin Michlmayr
[started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/03/msg00004.html) a discussion on requirements and rights for official Debian [sub-projects](https://www.debian.org/devel/#projects). He asked in particular if a
sub-projects may handle their own finances and ask for donations if they
have special needs such as [Debonaras](http://www.debonaras.org/).


**Debian/kFreeBSD for AMD64.** Robert Millan [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64/2006/03/msg00017.html)
the availability of an experimental base Debian GNU/kFreeBSD system for the
amd64 architecture. It uses the GNU C library ported by Petr Salinger and
requires a running version of FreeBSD 6.0 on amd64 and works only as chroot
environment. Aurelien Jarno [added](http://blog.aurel32.net/?p=25) a note about the setup of a build daemon for this system.


**Subscribing to new CDD Packages?** Enrico Zini [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-custom/2006/03/msg00001.html)
about an idea to create a mechanism that will allow users to receive new
packages for their custom Debian distribution (CDD) when they are properly
tagged for this particular suite. A solution still needs to be found to mark
packages for installation, though.


**IRC Debate for the Project Leader Election.** Thaddeus Black
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00001.html) the live debate of this year's project leader candidates on
IRC. The debate will be moderated by Don Armstrong and take place on
Thursday, 16 March 2006 from 22:30 UTC to 01:00 UTC on #debian-dpl-debate on
irc.debian.org. He asked for volunteers for the panel and questions to be
asked the candidates.


**Supporting Backports officially.** Joseph Smidt [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg01403.html)
if [backports](http://backports.org/) will ever be officially
supported by Debian. Norbert Tretkowski [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg01414.html)
that it may be possible to provide some official backports in the future but
quite unlikely to make all packages from backports.org official.


**QA Activities List.** Lars Wirzenius [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2006/02/msg00033.html) if
there exists a list of what QA activities are being performed as he
contemplates to help but not duplicate the effort of others. Such a list is
composed within the [Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/qa%2edebian%2eorg/activities) for easier
maintenance. Jeroen van Wolffelaar additionally [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2006/02/msg00042.html) for
help maintaining the [qa.debian.org](https://qa.debian.org/)
website.


**DPL Campaigning Summaries.** David Schmitt [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/03/msg00056.html)
that he is producing a [summary](http://debian.edv-bus.at/vote-2006/questions.html) of the
questions asked and answers given by the 2006 project leader [candidates](https://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_002) during the election campaign.
The summary will be updated as questions are asked and answers published.


**New packages.debian.org Host.** The Debian project [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00004.html) the re-availability of the [packages.debian.org](https://packages.debian.org/) service on a new
machine. The system has been donated by [Schlund + Partner](http://www.schlund.de/) where it is hosted
as well. It is a Dual-Core Opteron and only runs this service for Debian users
and developers.


**Checking Build Logs.** Samuel Thibault [demonstrated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg01546.html) that missing function declarations can cause problems in
running systems and proposed to add compiler flags that will cause the build
to fail when a function is not declared. Kurt Roeckx [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg01550.html)
more problematic programming errors that should be taken care of. Steve
Greenland [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg01555.html)
that there is no excuse for these bugs since they are easy to fix.
