Debian Weekly News - January 10th, 2006
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 2nd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Jeroen van Wolffelaar [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/01/msg00035.html)
that [packages.debian.org](https://packages.debian.org/) has been
disabled due to performance issues. Neil McGovern [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/01/msg00000.html) for sponsorship requests for active Debian people for the last time
for the upcoming [Debian
Conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0514-debconf).


**Status of non-free Firmware.** Sven Luther [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2006/01/msg00241.html)
the status of non-free [firmware](https://wiki.debian.org/KernelFirmwareLicensing) blobs in the Debian Linux kernel. Some of them have been
relicensed and are redistributable again, others have been separated from the
kernel into userland to be used by the `request_firmware`
infrastructure. Steve Langasek plans
to start a general resolution to decide whether Debian requires the source
code for firmware blobs.


**FOSDEM Booth for Debian.** Wouter Verhelst is [looking](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2006/01/msg00021.html) for volunteers to help man the booth at the upcoming [FOSDEM](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0225-fosdem) conference. He is also
interested in suggestions for something they could show at the booth. The
Debian project will also have a developers room in which talks will be
held.


**Bits from the Release Team.** Andreas Barth [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/01/msg00001.html) about the expectations of the release team for 2006 which
includes to release [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) at the beginning
of December. He asked to take more care about release critical bugs now and
to be careful when performing non-maintainer uploads. The essential toolchain
and kernels will be frozen at the end of July.


**New Technical Committee Members.** After extensive
consultation with the existing members of the technical committee and earlier
resignations of Wichert Akkerman, Jason Gunthorpe, and Guy Maor Branden
Robinson has [appointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/01/msg00013.html) Steve Langasek, Anthony Towns, and Andreas Barth as new members
of the technical committee.


**Stable Aliases for CD Drives.** Marco d'Itri [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg01390.html)
that the convenient `/dev/cdrom` symlink will not be supported
anymore. Joey Hess [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg01412.html)
that this link needs to be available in an installed system for APT to work
properly with a local CD attached. Adrian von Bidder [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg01467.html)
that similarly stable Ethernet interface names which suddenly become unstable
after an upgrade are not funny.


**Debian Archive Split and AMD64 Integration?** Martin
Zobel-Helas [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/01/msg00019.html) about the status of the archive split and the integration of the [AMD64](https://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/) port. Anthony Towns [mentioned](http://azure.humbug.org.au/~aj/blog/2005/11/16#2005-11-16-dak) the archive split that prevents AMD64 from being integrated into
the normal Debian development environment earlier already. New patches need
to be tested.


**GnuPG Error during Upgrade.** Bernd Prager [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2006/01/msg00593.html)
that upgrading Debian fails with a missing key error since a new archive key
is used for signing. Lee Chinook [provided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2006/01/msg00675.html)
the path to the new [key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/ziyi_key_2006.asc) and the instructions to incorporate it.


**Obsoleted Package: xlibs-dev.** David Nusinow [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/01/msg00003.html) that with the upload of X.org 6.9 to unstable the
`xlibs-dev` metapackage is no longer [built](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00022.html). As a result many packages fail to build until their build
dependencies have been adjusted to list only the required libraries. Since
all such libraries are also available in [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) the packages can still be backported easily.
