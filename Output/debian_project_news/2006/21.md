Debian Weekly News - May 23rd, 2006
===================================


Welcome to this year's 21st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Julien Danjou [reported](http://julien.danjou.info/blog/index.php/2006/04/07/259-netbsd-3-in-xen) that he has successfully installed NetBSD 3 inside the new Xen 3
virtual machine monitor available in Debian unstable. Eric Dorland [explained](http://ze-dinosaur.livejournal.com/7036.html) the creation
of library packages with debugging capabilities.


**Graphical Debian Installer Images.** Frans Pop [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg00734.html)
that the graphical [installer](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/GUI) is part of the regular daily built [images](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) for the i386 platform with
AMD and PowerPC following soon. To use the new installer the boot argument
"`installgui`" or "`expertgui`" has to be used. Frans
Pop [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2006/05/msg00503.html) that the graphical installer could be the default in the release
after [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/).


**Sun Java distributed by Debian.** Jeroen van Wolffelaar [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/05/msg00010.html) the availability of Sun's [Java](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/libs/sun-java5-jre) package
in the non-free section of Debian after Sun has [reworked](http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2006-05/sunflash.20060516.4.xml) their license. Debian still remains committed to supporting free
runtime and development environments for Java, such as [Kaffe](https://packages.debian.org/kaffe) and [GCJ](https://packages.debian.org/gcj). Red Hat, however, [complained](http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2006/05/18/red_hat_sun_java_license/) that this is not free enough and that Sun should free their virtual
machine (JVM) at least.


**DebConf6 successfully finished.** The 6th [Debian Conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0514-debconf),
which was held last week in Mexico, has ended. Many thanks go to the [sponsors](https://debconf6.debconf.org/) and the organisation
team, who made this great Debian event possible. A lot of
[photos](https://gallery.debconf.org/debconf6) were taken and in
about four weeks a DVD with all talks will be available.


**Splitting Changelog Files.** Nico Golde [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg01098.html)
about the proper way to handle large and old debian changelog files when they
are edited quite often and grew very large. The predominant [opinion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg01144.html)
is to keep the entire file as it contains information about why and when bugs
have been fixed. Since it is compressed in the package, the space consumption
is usually acceptable.


**Project Leader Report.** Anthony Towns [encouraged](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/05/msg00009.html) everybody to think about ways the Debian project could help
organisations that would like to be partners to cooperate better with Debian.
He pondered about a social contract for partners and is seeking input. He
also reported about the large number of sponsors for this year's Debian
Conference and the participation in Google's [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/).
