Debian Weekly News - May 2nd, 2006
==================================


Welcome to this year's 18th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. JÃ¶rg Jaspert [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg01032.html)
that the web content for past Debian Conferences is online again. In an
effort to remove old cruft Andreas Barth [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2006/04/msg00067.html) to
remove packages from unstable which are neither available in the current [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) nor in the upcoming [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) distribution.


**PowerPC Port needs Help.** Frans Pop [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-powerpc/2006/03/msg00490.html)
for help with the PowerPC port of the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/). In particular
someone is needed to take responsibility for architecture-specific issues. This
comprises of regularly testing of the installer, keeping an eye on installation
reports, taking care of architecture specific components of the installer,
resolving bugs and taking care of daily builds.


**Relicensing the Debian Web Pages.** Javier FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino
PeÃ±a [pointed out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2006/04/msg00126.html) that there is still an open [bug](https://bugs.debian.org/238245) in the [bug tracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/) which is about the non-[DFSG](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)-free license for the
current Debian web pages. It was suggested to use an modified FreeBSD
documentation [license](https://www.freebsd.org/copyright/freebsd-doc-license.html).
Some others
want to use the GPL for the web pages. There are also technical, legal
and practical problems which needs to be resolved before the license
could be changed. The [discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2006/04/threads.html)
is still ongoing on the [debian-www](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www/) mailing list.


**Avoiding native Debian Packages.** Panu Kalliokoski [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg01193.html)
why one should not add Debian packaging information to upstream
packages. Lars Wirzenius [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg01194.html)
the benefits as keeping package fixes out of upstream and to simplify
things if the upstream maintainer is no longer a Debian developer.
Henning Makholm [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg01207.html)
that the lack of Debian-specific information indicates that the package
might be useful by any GNU/Linux distribution.


**/usr/doc Transition finished.** Joey Hess [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg00166.html)
that he has opened bug reports for the last remaining packages which still
create `/usr/doc` symlinks. This final step marks the end of the
era of regular documentation in `/usr/doc`.


**Device Mapper Support for Block Device ID Library.**
Theodore Ts'o [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg00265.html)
that he has received a patch which allows the block device id library to
properly handle device mapper partitions. Since this would essentially drag
in three more libraries into everybody's systems he wondered if this would be
acceptable. Mike Hommey [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg00267.html)
that two of them have already been added via other packages.


**New Features of Buildd.Net.** Ingo JÃ¼rgensmann [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg00437.html)
new features of [buildd.net](http://www.buildd.net/) such as
tracking packages for sarge [backports](http://www.backports.org/),
various new package state checks, estimation of time needed for building all
packages in a queue, a new mailing list for discussions and as a bonus the
source is [available](http://www.buildd.net/source/) under a sane
license.


**Stable Installer Update.** Frans Pop [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2006/04/msg00715.html)
how to deal with ABI changes introduced by the recent kernel [security](https://www.debian.org/security/2006/dsa-1018) [updates](https://www.debian.org/security/2006/dsa-1017) and to rebuild the installer
images using the new kernel udebs. This will break some existing installation
images. The main problem is going to be testing the new images as it will not
be possible to run an installation and download udebs from different
sources.


**Removing Log Files during Package Purge?** Martin Krafft [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg00688.html)
to alter the policy to not remove log files upon package purge. He argued that
this removal may put an administrator into legal trouble with the authorities in
Europe. Marco d'Itri [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg00691.html)
to run a backup prior to the package purge or not purge it at all if not all
files should be removed anyway.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
