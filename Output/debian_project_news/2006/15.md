Debian Weekly News - April 11th, 2006
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 15th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Martin Zobel-Helas [sent](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/04/msg00023.html)
out an update of the [preparations](https://release.debian.org/stable/3.1/3.1r2/) for an updated [stable](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/)
distribution. When this newsletter is released, the Debian project has [elected](https://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_002) a new project leader.
Congratulations.


**Internationalisation Collaboration Server.** Jaldhar H. Vyas [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/03/msg00280.html)
if it would be possible to set up a central website for coordinating
translation efforts within Debian. He suggested several tools which were
working like Ubuntu's proprietary Rosetta tool.
Margarita Manterola [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/03/msg00282.html)
that such a website would encourage a lot of
people to contribute to Debian who were unable to do so with the
existing translation tools.


**Proposed General Resolution.** Josselin Mouette [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/04/msg00002.html)
a new general solution to alter the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)
in response to the [resolution](https://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001) that
allows some documents licensed under the [GNU Free Documentation License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html)
to go into the main archive. Jacobo Tarrio [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/04/msg00008.html) that the wording would allow documents with strong [restrictions](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/04/msg00012.html) to go into main as well.


**Debian-Installer for Linksys NSLU2.** Martin Michlmayr [reported](http://www.cyrius.com/journal/debian/beta2-nslu2) that
basic support for Linksys NSLU2 machines has been included in the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/). This is a sub
$100 ARM device with 32Â MB RAM, Ethernet and two USB ports on which one
can attach a USB disk and run a full Debian system. One reason why only few
people are working on the ARM port is probably the lack of a cheap platform,
which has been fixed now.


**Changes to su and sudo.** Christian Perrier [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00003.html) changes in the new `su` program. Arguments to
executed scripts have to be quoted together with the program name. Joey
Schulze [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/debian-security-announce-2006/msg00115.html) that new [sudo](https://packages.debian.org/sudo)
packages will still correct recently reported security [vulnerabilities](https://www.debian.org/security/2006/dsa-946) but be less strict in
which environment variables are passed to executed scripts.


**Xen in Debian.** Julien Danjou [reported](http://julien.danjou.info/blog/index.php/2006/02/27/233-about-xen-in-debian) that he has started a [Xen packaging](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-xen) project on
[Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/) to foster inclusion in Debian.
Functional and split packages of Xen 3 are also available from the
Subversion [repository](https://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-xen).


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
