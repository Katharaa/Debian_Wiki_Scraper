Debian Weekly News - August 1st, 2006
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 31st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Christoph Berg [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2006/07/msg00093.html)
nine new members of the QA team who already work on outstanding issues in the
[etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) release. Gintautas Miliauskas [reported](http://gintasm.blogspot.com/2006/06/localization-coordination-for-debian-1.html) that he has been working on an integrated localisation infrastructure for
Debian based on the framework of the [WordForge](http://www.wordforge.org/) project.


**Uploading with proper Urgencies.** Adeodato SimÃ³ [reminded](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/07/msg00008.html) developers to upload fixed packages with urgency
`high` if they fix security-related bugs. The urgency
`medium` should be used for release-critical bugs including
corrections to failures to build from source on one or other [architecture](https://www.debian.org/ports/). Since these uploads will migrate into
[testing](https://www.debian.org/releases/testing/) faster than normal, they
should be prepared with extra care as well.


**Responsibility for Packages.** Martin Krafft [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/07/msg00190.html)
if Debian wants to change responsibilities for packages and move to more group
maintained packages. Adeodato SimÃ³ [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/07/msg00231.html)
that having the non-maintainer diff in the [bug
tracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/) for a few days before entering the archive does help QA,
because there's room for peer review.


**Xen on Debian GNU/Linux 3.1.** Aike de Jongste [explained](https://www.debian-administration.org/articles/423) how to
install the [backported](http://www.backports.org/) version of [Xen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xen) on a [stable](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) Debian system. This includes APT [pinning](http://jaqque.sbih.org/kplug/apt-pinning.html) of several
packages, creating a special RAM disk, adding an item to the [grub](https://packages.debian.org/grub) menu and [setting up](https://www.debian-administration.org/articles/396) a Xen
instance.


**Branding for Debian Derivatives.** Anthony Towns [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/07/msg00241.html)
to introduce an official branding programme for derived distributions to
help our derivatives get the benefits of Debian's reputation. In the essence
the derivatives should listen to their users and cooperate with the Free
Software community. In return Debian should provide a logo, add a link from
its website, cooperate on press releases and provide a supportive basis for
future cooperation and consultation.


**Key Management for Secure APT.** Joey Schulze [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/07/msg00192.html) if key management could be added into [APT](https://packages.debian.org/apt) in time for the [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) release. Martin Krafft [discouraged](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/07/msg00194.html) plain automatic key upgrades since they are too vulnerable
to attacks and preferred a third party authority to sign the keys. Florian
Weimer [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/07/msg00201.html) that the only approach known to work is static keys for stable
releases and stable security updates.


**Supporting Exim 3 in Etch?** Marc Haber [outlined](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/07/msg00228.html)
the steps required to remove version 3 of [Exim](https://packages.debian.org/exim) from [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) since it is not supported by upstream
anymore and even its maintainer has stopped using it in the meantime. This
includes an update to [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) and also
requires manual work when users upgrade from sarge to etch.


**Building Documentation.** Marcio Roberto Teixeira [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg00101.html)
if documentation for a Debian package should better be built before packaging
to save build time or during the regular build process. Goswin von Brederlow
[explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg00232.html) that documentation should be built together with the rest of the
package. If building takes long it should not be done with every package
built but only with the one producing the binary-independent package.


**Installing setuid Programs.** Yui-wah Lee (李 銳華)
[wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg00105.html)
how a program should be packaged that needs to be installed setuid or setgid.
Matthew Palmer [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg00115.html)
that the maintainer should set the appropriate permissions and may have to
tweak `dh_fixperms` so that it doesn't turn the permissions back to
the default. Local admins can change these permissions with
`dpkg-statoverride`.


**Status of translated Packages Descriptions.** Michael Vogt [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg01323.html)
for testing of [APT](https://packages.debian.org/apt) from
experimental. This version supports translated package descriptions which are
already available for [sid](https://www.debian.org/releases/sid/) on many
mirrors and on the Debian description translation [project](https://ddtp.debian.org/). A few features which where available in the
past such as reviewing of a translation are not yet implemented but are [planned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg01379.html)
as part of the new internationalisation framework.
