Debian Weekly News - June 13th, 2006
====================================


Welcome to this year's 24th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Jeff Licquia [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/06/msg00061.html)
that the last tests he ran would have been acceptable for passing the [Linux Standard Base
3.1](http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.1.0/). OSDir put up a [screenshot](http://shots.osdir.com/slideshows/slideshow.php?release=658&slide=1) tour of the second beta release of the [installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) for Debian [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/).


**Debian CGL registration.** Troy Heber
[reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/06/msg00043.html) that Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 has been [registered](http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/06/05/1713247) against OSDL's CGL 2.0.2 specification as a Carrier Grade Linux
(CGL) [distribution](http://osdl.org/lab_activities/carrier_grade_linux/registration.html) by HP. Since Debian does not meet the [requirements](http://www.osdl.org/docs/cgl_requirements_definition___v202.pdf) with 100 % an analysis will show where it falls and
help correct this for
future releases. Ideally this would result in a [fully
integrated](https://wiki.debian.org/Debian-CGL?highlight=%28CGL%29) Custom Debian Distribution.


**GNOME 1 Packages in Debian.** Nathanael Nerode [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome/2006/06/msg00034.html)
what to do with the remaining GNOME 1 packages that are in the archive. With
the new [GnuCash](https://packages.debian.org/gnucash) based on GTK2
entering [testing](https://www.debian.org/releases/testing) it is finally
possible to minimise the number of these library packages that are no longer supported by
upstream as they were only used by the old GnuCash version.


**Graphical Reportbug.** Philipp Kern [reported](http://blog.philkern.de/archives/177-First-SoC-status-report-Reportbug-Gnome2-GUI.html) that he is in the process of programming a graphical frontend to
the [reportbug](https://packages.debian.org/reportbug) tool. The
goal is to give even inexperienced users the chance to report bugs and wishes
to developers. Philipp's project is part of Debian's [participation](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2006) of this
year's [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) from
Google.


**Debian is not a SuperMarket.** Joey Hess [coined](http://business.newsforge.com/business/06/05/22/1240231.shtml)
the term supermarket for Debian as a resource of packages when he was talking
about fears that Debian could degrade into a collection of not well integrated
software while many people use derivates that would simply use this pool. He
[explained](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/the_supermarket_thing.html) that Debian is not only about packaging but also about
integrating and making it the best distribution.


**Valid Shells for System Accounts?** Uwe Hermann [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg01208.html)
which system users should get a valid shell and which shouldn't. Colin Watson
[explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg01209.html) that it's a long-term [goal](https://bugs.debian.org/330882) to disable the shell for some system users after checking on a
case-by-case basis. Javier FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino PeÃ±a [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg01225.html)
disabling recommendations and provided information on using
`nologin` as shell.


**Sailing with Debian.** Members of the Austrian [InnoC](http://www.innoc.at/) association have [won](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/74107) the first [Microtransat](http://wiki.atrox.at/index.php/Microtransat) challenge
for autonomous sailing vessels in Toulouse. Their [boat](http://www.innoc.at/) is a conventional model sailing vessel
enhanced with a fan-less Mini-ITX computer running Debian GNU/Linux at
600 MHz with 1 GB flash memory and a number of sensors.


**Interview with the DPL.** Thomas SchÃ¶nhoff published an [interview](http://www.pro-linux.de/berichte/interview-towns-mcintyre-en.html) he conducted with Anthony Towns, the current Debian project
[leader](https://www.debian.org/devel/leader), and his deputy Steve McIntyre. The
questions cover stable updates, personal visions, relationship with
derivatives, support for stable releases and integrating Hurd, BSD and
SELinux.


**Changing the Optimisation for compiled Packages.** RogÃ©rio
Brito [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg01235.html) about the feasibility of compiling some packages with the
optimisation `-Os` instead of `-O2`. Thiemo Seufer [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg01320.html)
that for some CPUs either optimisation may be better while it isn't for the
other. Gabor Gombas [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg01314.html)
that using `-Os` on a large scale may discover new and interesting
compiler bugs.


**Changed Location for CGI Scripts.** Alexis Sukrieh [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg01240.html) that [lintian](https://packages.debian.org/lintian) claimed
that CGI scripts should be installed in `/usr/lib/cgi-lib` instead
of `/usr/lib/cgi-bin`. Joey Hess [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg01249.html)
that this was discussed in 2003 but support for it has been dropped
afterwards. Steve Langasek [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg01270.html)
that this requirement has been reverted in more recent policy.
