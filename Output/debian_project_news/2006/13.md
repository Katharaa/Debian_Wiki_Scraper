Debian Weekly News - March 28th, 2006
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 13th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. David Moreno Garza [built](http://www.damog.net/?p=473) an RSS [feed](http://www.g33k.com.ve/~damog/debian/feeds/dwn.xml) for the
Debian Weekly News. Manoj Srivastava [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00022.html) for votes for this year's project leader [election](https://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_002) which has seen the lowest
participation ever in a Debian project leader election seen so far. Votes
must be received by April 8th, 2006.


**Deprecating debmake after etch.** Santiago Vila [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00019.html) that [debmake](https://packages.debian.org/debmake)
will be removed from testing and unstable some time after the release of [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/). Maintainers of the remaining
packages (less than 60) that still use debmake for packaging should switch to other
tools soon. In a few months he will open bug reports against the remaining
packages.


**Past Events Notes.** Alexander Schmehl [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/03/msg00215.html)
about past [events](https://www.debian.org/events/) where the Debian project was
present. There were booths and participation at the [FOSDEM](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0225-fosdem) in Belgium, the [Chemnitzer Linux-Tage](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0304-linuxtag-chemnitz)
and the [CeBIT](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0309-cebit) in Hannover.
Alexander also seeks for support for upcoming events like the South Pacific
Linux World in Australia or the LinuxWorld Conference & Expo in Korea.


**New Debian-Edu/Skolelinux Release.** Finn-Arne Johansen [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2006/03/msg00067.html) the new version 2.0 of Skolelinux after a long period of
development. It contains many updates and new features such as sound on thin
clients, improved hardware detection, a new version of KDE and many updated
translations for an increasing number of languages. A lot of documentation
has also been [improved](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2006/03/msg00128.html)
to provide a better overview about the project and make it easier to join the
team.


**Limitations of reportbug.** Kamaraju Kusumanchi [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg00523.html)
that the [reportbug](https://packages.debian.org/reportbug) utility
has displayed more than 600 bug report titles when he wanted to report a bug.
Since searching for keywords in bug reports is not supported Marco d'Itri [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg00530.html)
using [Google
groups](http://groups.google.com/group/linux.debian.bugs.dist) for this.


**Debian Fonts Task Force.** Christian Perrier [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg00248.html) the goals of the foundation of a font
packages maintenance team for Debian. One of the goals for this team
is setting up a font packaging policy to improve
the incorporation of new fonts in Debian. A dedicated [project](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-fonts/)
was set up on [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/)
along with a Subversion repository and a [mailing list](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-fonts-devel/).


**Supported Languages for the Debian-Installer.**
Just after the second beta [release](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/News/2006/20060315) of the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/), Christian Perrier [indicated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2006/03/msg00055.html) that work was going on for the installer localisation. He [cleaned out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2006/03/msg00054.html) his debian-installer supported languages [list](https://people.debian.org/~bubulle/d-i/i18n-doc/languages.html). New languages are [still](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2006/03/msg00074.html)
being added but if people want their language to be supported in
etch's installer, work must start now.


**Archive Recompilation with GCC 4.1.** Martin Michlmayr [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg01084.html)
that over the last two weeks he has compiled the
whole Debian archive on a quad-core Broadcom MIPS box using GCC 4.1. The
aim was to discover problems in GCC 4.1 itself and bugs in packages exhibited
by GCC's increased standards conformance (in particular regarding C++
code). Through the compilation of about 6200 packages, he found 500 new
bugs: 280 of which are due to the increased strictness of GCC 4.1.


**Writing Copyright Files.** JÃ¶rg Jaspert [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00023.html) about the requirements of information in `copyright`
files since many rejects from the [NEW](https://ftp-master.debian.org/REJECT-FAQ.html) queue are still
due to broken or incomplete copyright-files. It must contain the author(s)
name, the year(s) of the copyright, the used license(s) and the URL to the
upstream source.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
