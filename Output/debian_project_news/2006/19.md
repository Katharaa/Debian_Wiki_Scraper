Debian Weekly News - May 9th, 2006
==================================


Welcome to this year's 19th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Uwe Hermann [investigated](http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/debian-packages-release-names) changelog files and recognised a number of interesting release
names for packages. Several Debian developers gather in Oaxtepec, Mexico,
where this year's [Debian Conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0514-debconf)
will take place and is preceded by a working camp that already started.


**Unified Terminology for Distribution Names.** Christian
Perrier [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/05/msg00000.html)
on a discussion on the [debian-l10n-french](https://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-french/)
mailing list covering different terminology in various Debian documents
referring to `stable`, `sarge`, 3.1 etc. He [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/05/msg00122.html) to
use distribution to refer to the Debian distribution in general and
suite when talking about `stable`, `testing` etc., using
release for release names and version when referring to the version numbers.


**Moving irc.debian.org.** Steve McIntyre [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/04/msg00333.html)
if it would be useful to move the irc.debian.org alias away from the [Freenode](https://freenode.net/) network to the [OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/oftc/) network, which is a supported
project of [SPI](https://www.spi-inc.org/) and hosts IRC
channels for a lot of open source projects. Steve's intention was seconded
by a number of developers. This move would have the advantage that all
Debian related IRC channels could be concentrated on one IRC network.
Paul Johnson [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/04/msg00342.html)
if it would be better to move to a Jabber-based network instead of IRC.


**Etch Release Update.** Andreas Barth [confirmed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/05/msg00000.html) the timeline to release [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) in December. He stated that the [ARM](https://www.debian.org/ports/arm/) port qualifies as a release architecture again and that the list of
release architectures are not finalised and will be re-evaluated twice before
the release. The kernel that will be used still needs to be decided upon. More release
assistants will help keep the release on track.


**Tracking forwarded bugs in the BTS.** Pierre Habouzit [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/05/msg00001.html) the creation of a new service called [bts-link](https://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/bts-link/trunk/). It
allows Debian maintainers to follow the status of the bugs they
forward to their upstream's bug tracking
systems directly in the Debian BTS. As of now, it supports
[Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/) (which
is used by KDE, Gnome, X.org, GCC, Mozilla and others),
[Trac](http://www.edgewall.com/trac/) (used by VideoLAN) and
[Savannah](http://savannah.gnu.org/). [Sourceforge](http://www.sourceforge.net/)'s bug tracking system
shall follow.


**Automating new Debian Installations with Preseeding.** A new
[document](https://www.debian-administration.org/articles/394)
describes the technique of doing unattended Debian installations with
preseeding. The preseed file contains answers to all [debconf](https://packages.debian.org/debconf) questions asked during
the installation. Its generation is explained in the article. The file's
location may be given as a path or a URL.


**Debian participates in the Summer of Code.** The Debian
project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2006/20060508) its participation
in Google's [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/). More
than 50 development [tasks](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2006) related to Debian cover general improvements, quality assurance,
releasing and testing the distribution, package management, new applications,
security, infrastructure and the improvement of particular packages. Students
and the mentoring organisation will receive funding after the tasks have been
worked on.


**Wiki Development.** Petter Reinholdtsen [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2006/04/msg00157.html)
about his efforts to write Wiki pages with [OpenOffice.org](https://packages.debian.org/openoffice.org) which is
done with the help of a [macro
set](http://ooowiki.de/Writer2MoinMoin) that converts an OpenOffice.org document into MoinMoin syntax. Later
he [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2006/05/msg00017.html) successful PDF generation from the Wiki page by exporting the
contents as DocBook XML.


**Maintainer's Karma revived.** GÃ¼rkan SengÃ¼n was missing the old
karma page from Dirk EddelbÃ¼ttel and the package status page by Takuo Kitame
(北目 拓郎).
To fill the gap he has [created](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00840.html)
a new overview
page combining both. This service is hosted on the GNU/kFreeBSD porter
machine, kindly provided by Aurelien
Jarno.
