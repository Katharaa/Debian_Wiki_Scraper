Debian Weekly News - March 14th, 2006
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 11th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg01826.html)
to write down the design of a [collaborative
maintenance](https://wiki.debian.org/CollaborativeMaintenance) infrastructure and created a mailing list for further
discussions.


**Debian QA Meeting in Extremadura.** Martin Michlmayr [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00006.html) for participation at the Debian Quality Assurance [meeting](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianQAExtremadura2006) in December
in Extremadura, Spain. It is intended to help coordinate the QA work in
Debian and is limited to 20 people. The Region of Extremadura will kindly
cover travel expenses for attendants from Europe.


**Debian Backup Server.** Joey Schulze [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00005.html) a dedicated backup server for important Debian resources
excluding the buildd systems. The backup of a resource consists of 10 to 100
versions. Since a history of changes is maintained on the backup machine
Debian administration can roll back a resource to an older version and also
extract differences between past versions on demand.


**Updates from the Debian Kernel Team.** Bastian Blank [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00007.html) about the work of the Debian kernel team. The most visible
change is the move from `kernel-image-` packages to
`linux-image-` packages. There has also been excitement about a
new x86 SMP patch, which would allow a reduction in the current number of flavours.
They are also working on adding VServer, Xen and UML flavours to
linux-2.6.


**Martin 'Joey' Schulze steps down as Stable Release
Manager.** After continuous discrepancies with the ftpmasters, Martin
'Joey' Schulze has now [resigned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00008.html) from his position as Stable Release Manager. He has held that
position since 2001 and it will now be [taken over](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00009.html) by Andreas Barth and Martin Zobel-Helas.


**Results of the General Resolution about the GFDL.** Manoj
Srivastava [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00012.html) that the Debian project has decided that works licensed under
the [GNU Free Documentation
License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) (GFDL) without unmodifiable sections are free. 369 Debian
developers took part in this [general resolution](https://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001), 428 ballots have been received in total.


**The Role of the Project Leader.** Martin Michlmayr [reflected](http://www.cyrius.com/journal/debian/being-dpl) on the
role of the [leader](https://www.debian.org/devel/leader) of the Debian project
(DPL). He basically states that the DPL can't solve all problems and that an
often called strong leader won't be followed either. Instead of asking the
DPL what they'll do to solve the problems he suggested the developers to ask
themselves what they could do to improve the situation.


**Influencing Haskell Development.** Isaac Jones [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg01899.html)
the Debian community to look at Haskell98 and some of the "research" [extensions](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/ghc-language-features.html) and give upstream developers some input about what would make
Haskell more attractive. He is trying to make [Haskell](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime) more suitable
for practical applications and reported on efforts to develop CPAN-like
and apt-get-like systems for it.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
