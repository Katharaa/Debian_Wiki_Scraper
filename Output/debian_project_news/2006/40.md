Debian Weekly News - October 31st, 2006
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 40th issue of DWN, the newsletter for the
Debian community. This [DebianHelp](http://www.debianhelp.co.uk/)
site contains a lot of information for Debian beginners. Since DWN is not [published](http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200610250942)
weekly anymore Joey Hess [started](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/DWN_items_1.html) to
write weekly summaries to fill the gap. Parts have been included in this
issue already. Jorge Salamero Sanz [set up](http://bencer.cauterized.net/blog/index.php?blog/show/44)
a [repository](http://pulsar.unizar.es/nokia770) with ported
applications for the [Nokia 770](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_770_Internet_Tablet)
web tablet.


**Source-less Binary Objects in the Debian Linux 2.6 Packages.**
Frederik SchÃ¼ler [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/09/msg00215.html)
packages for Linux 2.6.18 and noted that this release contains all
firmware blobs shipped upstream, even those that used to be pruned. He
explained that the kernel team initially wanted to wait for a positive general
resolution vote outcome but anticipates this to be delayed indefinitely and decided
that this was not acceptable from a release point of view.


**Practical Linux Day in GieÃen.** On October 21st the sixth [Practical Linux Day](http://www.practical-linux.de/) was held at the
University of Applied Sciences in GieÃen, Germany. Debian participated with
an own [booth](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/1021-plgiessen), which was
managed in cooperation with the people of [Skolelinux](http://www.skolelinux.de/)/[DebianEdu](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu).
Martin 'Joey' Schulze also delivered an introductory talk about the Debian project.


**Videos of the Internationalisation Meeting.** Nicolas FranÃ§ois [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2006/09/msg00288.html) [videos](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2006/i18n-extremadura/) recorded during sessions of the first internationalisation [meeting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/09/msg00012.html)
that took place from September 7th to 9th in Casar de Caceres, Extremadura, Spain.
The participants agreed to set up an internationalisation server that will
hosted in the datacenter of the Junta de Extremadura. Users are asked to test
the new [installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) in their
native language and report bugs to ensure that the translations are done well.


**Debian Conference Videos.** Ben Hutchings [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/10/msg00023.html) DVDs with talks from this year's [Debian Conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0514-debconf) in Oaxtepec, Mexico, prepared by the [video team](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2006/debconf6/CREDITS). There are [two](http://womble.decadent.org.uk/software/debconf6-dvd/menus/en-1/main.html) [discs](http://womble.decadent.org.uk/software/debconf6-dvd/menus/en-2/main.html) with all English sessions and extras, and one [disc](http://womble.decadent.org.uk/software/debconf6-dvd/menus/es/main.html) with all Spanish sessions and all [DebianDay](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0513-debianday) sessions. The DVD
images are available for [download](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2006/debconf6/) along with the respective source videos. You can also [order](http://www.decadent.org.uk/cgi-bin/debconf-dvd-order.py)
the DVDs in a nice box.


**Debian Internationalisation Server.** Christian Perrier [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/10/msg00024.html) the [server](http://i18n.debian.net/) that will be
used to build the internationalisation infrastructure for the Debian project.
The server is hosted in the Junta de Extremadura datacenter, in Badajoz,
Spain. A [pootle](http://translate.sourceforge.net/) server
is running on the server with environments for alternative or complementary
software. It is also used to extract the localisation [material](http://i18n.debian.net/material/) of the Debian
packages.


**ResumÃ© Practical Linux GieÃen.** Martin 'Joey' Schulze [reported](http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200610231043) that the
Debian project shared a booth at this year's [Practical Linux](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/1021-plgiessen) conference with
[Skolelinux](http://www.skolelinux.org/) and that both projects
delivered a talk. 40 to 50 people were listening to each speech which seems
to be quite good for such a small event. Kurt Gramlich and himself filled in
for another speaker as well and talked about several issues more detailed.


**Call for Testing the Debian-Installer.** Frans Pop [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/10/msg00021.html) for testing the [daily builds](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/daily-builds/daily/arch-latest/) of the new [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/). The release
candidate 1 of the installer is imminent and the goal is to squash as
many bugs as possible. A wiki [page](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/EtchRC1Prep)
gives an overview about the release and known issues. Testers are encouraged
to file a bug report with the results of their installation against the virtual [installation-report](https://bugs.debian.org/installation-report)
package.


**Dunc-Tank Position Statement.** JÃ¶rg Jaspert [published](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/10/msg00260.html)
a position statement signed by several developers in which they consider [Dunc-Tank](http://www.dunc-tank.org/) to be a major change to the
Debian project culture. They also raised several unanswered questions and
listed areas where developers have reduced their contribution because they
lost motivation as a result.


**Mplayer in Sid.** The [mplayer](https://packages.debian.org/mplayer) package has finally been
[accepted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2006/10/msg02869.html)
into the archive after the longest tenure in the NEW [queue](https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html) of any package
ever uploaded into Debian.
Congratulations to mplayer's maintainers and to the ftpmasters for resolving
the licencing issues that kept mplayer out of Debian for so long.
Depending on the videos to be played, non-free
codecs from [outside](http://www.debian-multimedia.org/) of Debian
may be needed, though.


**Installer String Freeze and Release Plans.** In preparation
for the first release candidate of the [installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) for [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/), a string freeze
has been going on, and changes to the installer are limited to bug fixing. Frans
Pop [posted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2006/10/msg00737.html)
details and a timeline for the release candidate. These preparations have already
[broken](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/News/2006/20061017)
most beta 3 images.


**Firefox becomes Iceweasel.** Due to trademark [issues](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00328.html)
the Debian project felt impelled to rename the Firefox web
browser to Iceweasel and the Thunderbird mail client to Icedove. Roberto
Sanchez [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/10/msg00665.html) that the new packages don't contain non-free artwork from the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) and that
security updates will be properly backported. The trademark [policy](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy.html)
requires that such packages are not distributed under the original name, hence
the new names.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
