Debian Weekly News - January 31st, 2006
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 5th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Martin Michlmayr [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/01/msg00063.html)
about two development MIPS boards donated to Debian that will be used as build
daemon for the MIPS architectures. Stephen Shankland [interviewed](http://news.com.com/Defender+of+the+GPL/2008-1082_3-6028495.html)
FSF attorney Eben Moglen on the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) [version 3](http://gplv3.fsf.org/) draft which [lead](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00394.html) to
[discussions](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00427.html) on the Debian lists.


**Call for Papers.** Margarita Manterola [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/01/msg00014.html) for papers for the upcoming [Debian Day](https://www.debconf.org/debianday/) which will take place
on Saturday, May 13th, before this year's [DebConf](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0514-debconf) in Oaxtepec, Mexico. The
presentations should be easy to understand, very clear and concise in their
content, and not require any previous knowledge about Debian from the
audience.


**Process to remove debmake.** Santiago Vila [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg01428.html)
about the demise of [debmake](https://packages.debian.org/debmake).
One year ago, the use of `debmake` for new packages was deprecated
and the included program `deb-make` removed. The next steps are
switching away from this tool and eventually opening release-critical bug
reports against remaining [packages](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg01435.html). Anthony Towns [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg01446.html) filing wishlist bugs now with a proper usertag.


**More volunteer Contributions.** Joseph Michael Smidt [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00004.html)
that all people want to feel important when they're making a contribution to
Debian. He would like to see an official title for all contributors so they
become a visible part of the community, especially since the [new maintainer](https://www.debian.org/devel/join/) process could be seen as a
barrier. The following discussion demonstrated several means to get
involved.


**New Semantic of /var/run.** Peter Eisentraut [forwarded](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00223.html)
a user [request](https://bugs.debian.org/344758) to create a
directory within `/var/run` upon service startup. Henrique
Holschuh [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00234.html) to go ahead since [initscripts](https://packages.debian.org/initscripts) are leaning
towards an ephemeral `/var/run` that will be [removed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00241.html)
upon reboot.


**Debian Archive Key Maintenance.** Petter Reinholdtsen [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00225.html)
problems upgrading [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) due to a missing
new archive key. Joey Hess [pondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00311.html)
whether this could result in a stable Debian release being uninstallable. [Distributing](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00368.html) updated keys in a security update would [break](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00369.html)
past policies concerning stable releases and users won't be able to install the
current stable release without the update.


**Launchpad for Debian?** Frans Jessop [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00349.html) if
it would be helpful, more organised, and efficient if Debian developers would
work with [launchpad](http://launchpad.net/). Matthew Garrett [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00351.html) that the general use is unlikely as long as it is not Free Software.
Andrew Suffield [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00391.html)
that removing the ability to manage things from the shell doesn't improve
efficiency.

that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.

**New or Noteworthy Packages.** Due to [packages.debian.org](https://packages.debian.org/) being down because
of performance issues we are unable to provide the regular list of new
packages.


**Orphaned Packages.** 2 packages were orphaned this week and
require a new maintainer. This makes a total of 197 orphaned packages. Many
thanks to the previous maintainers who contributed to the Free Software
community. Please see the [WNPP pages](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/) for
the full list, and please add a note to the bug report and retitle it to ITA:
if you plan to take over a package.


* [ivi](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/electronics/ivi)
 -- Graphical front-end for various HDL simulators.
 ([Bug#350149](https://bugs.debian.org/350149))
* [ud](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/ud)
 -- Uptime Daemon.
