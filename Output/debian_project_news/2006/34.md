Debian Weekly News - August 22nd, 2006
======================================


Welcome to this year's 34th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. JÃ¶rg Jaspert [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/08/msg00118.html) that the [backports](http://www.backports.org/)
archive also understands the tilde character in version strings and that
packages are set to `NotAutomatic` so that they shouldn't be
updated automatically anymore. [HP](http://www.hp.com/) recently
[announced](http://www.linuxworld.com.au/index.php/id;311998848;fp;2;fpid;1) that they support Debian GNU/Linux on its ProLiant, BladeSystem
servers, and the new HP t5725 Thin Client server.


**Event Coordination in the German-speaking Area.** Meike
Reichle [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2006/08/msg00019.html) a new Wiki [page](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEventsDe) for coordinating public events in the German-speaking area such as
fairs, exhibitions and conferences in which the Debian projects participates.
This is one result of a [meeting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2006/08/msg00031.html)
of Debian event organisers last weekend. Alexander Schmehl [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2006/08/msg00022.html)
that the events [section](https://www.debian.org/events/) on the Debian website
will be overhauled in the near future.


**WNPP Bug Report Page.** Hendrik Sattler [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/08/msg00236.html) that the [page](https://bugs.debian.org/wnpp)
for Work-Needing and Prospective Packages (WNPP) in the [bug tracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/) causes problems with Konqueror and
Firefox due to the sheer size of 3 MB. Ben Armstrong [reminded](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/08/msg00237.html) the existence of light [pages](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/)
with direct links to the different WNPP packages sections.


**Review of Debian Development Tools.**
As part of his research on Debian, Martin Krafft [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg01358.html) about the tools that have been successfully adopted
or those that have been rejected by the developers. Michael Banck [mentioned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg01360.html) [CDBS](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/cdbs), [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org) and Debian's
[Subversion repository](http://svn.debian.org), but [Debhelper](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/debhelper),
patch management systems and distributed version control systems have
also been widely adopted. Debian Developers also appreciated [devscripts](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/devscripts) and package checkers like [lintian](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/lintian),
[linda](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/linda) and [piuparts](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/piuparts).
A list of tools is [available](https://wiki.debian.org/madduck/adoptions).


**New Desktop Features.** Gustavo Noronha Silva [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/08/msg00629.html) the upload of a new version of [update-notifier](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/gnome/update-notifier). This tool, that was initially made by Ubuntu, puts
a notification icon in the notification area and warns the user about
updates being available. The version of the Debian package notifies about
reboot requirements for critical packages only and informs about Debian
CDs/DVDs inserted in the drive. Such features should contribute to
make Debian a nicer desktop distribution.


**Publicity for Debian Events.** Joey Schulze [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2006/08/msg00000.html) to emphasise events a bit more again. He suggested also more
talks and workshops with a Debian background and more promotion. This would
generate more interest by users to meet Debian people at exhibitions and
conferences and would give developers a better chance to talk to users in
person. It would also be nice if a [report](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0624-froscon-report) would be
written after the event.


**Alioth Updates.** Roland Mas [reported](http://roland.entierement.nu/blog/2006/08/17/bits-about-alioth.html) that the [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/) host
costa now supports both git and bzr for hosting source archives. He added an
explanation how to use both systems to access the repositories. User
replication has also been improved so that the downtime drops from 15 minutes
to only a few seconds.


**Etch Kernel Schedule Proposal.** Frederik SchÃ¼ler [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2006/08/msg00413.html)
to select 2.6.18, which is to be released within the next four weeks, as final
kernel for [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) and freeze it at the
beginning of November. Frans Pop, however, would [prefer](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2006/08/msg00415.html)
the kernel to remain in [unstable](https://www.debian.org/releases/unstable/) at
least one month before it migrates into [testing](https://www.debian.org/releases/testing/).


**New Architectures for Packages.** Ludovic Brenta [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg00537.html)
how to inform [build daemon](https://www.debian.org/devel/buildd/) that a package
should be built on another architecture than before. Luk Claes [answered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg00538.html)
that the maintainers of [Packages-arch-specific](http://cvs.debian.org/srcdep/Packages-arch-specific?cvsroot=dak) need to be contacted. Wouter Verhelst [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg00583.html) an
explanation why the wanna-build database doesn't use control files but archive
index files.


**Managing Packages with Subversion.** Marcus Better recently
[started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg00835.html) to use [subversion](https://packages.debian.org/subversion) to maintain his packages and wondered what the recommended
repository layout would be. The point of having a common layout is that it
would be possible to write support tools that make this layout less cumbersome
to work with.


**Creative Commons 3.0 Public Draft.** Evan Prodromou [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/08/msg00051.html)
on the [public](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6017) [draft](http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-licenses/2006-August/003855.html) of the next version of Creative Commons licenses. The changes from
the 2.x version are largely due to an effort to make the licenses compatible
with the Debian Free Software [Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) (DFSG). He wondered if the anti-DRM requirement in the license
draft, without a parallel distribution proviso, make it incompatible with the
DFSG?
