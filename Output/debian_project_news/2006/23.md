Debian Weekly News - June 6th, 2006
===================================


Welcome to this year's 23rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Enrico Zini [reported](http://www.enricozini.org/blog/eng/debtags-performance-burst.html) that he has increased the performance of [debtags](http://debtags.alioth.debian.org) by improving the [tagcoll](https://packages.debian.org/tagcoll) library. Krzysztof
Klincewicz [analysed](http://opensource.mit.edu/papers/klincewicz.pdf) 500 most active projects on [SourceForge](http://www.sourceforge.net/) and concluded that only
little innovation happens in these projects.


**Trustability of the Web of Trust.** During the recent [Debian Conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0514-debconf) Martin Krafft [conducted](http://blog.madduck.net/geek/2006.05.24-tr-id-at-keysigning.xhtml) a keysigning [experiment](http://blog.madduck.net/geek/2006.05.27-keysigning-again.xhtml) to raise questions about the Debian web of trust. This web
consists of signatures between GnuPG keys, which verify that the signer has
reason to believe that the key's owner is really the person who they claims to
be. However, the signer does not confirm the validity of a government-issued
form of identification, which is not possible given the wide variety of
identification to be found at an international event with 140
participants.


**Security Support for Woody ending.** The Debian Project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2006/20060601) that more than one year after
the release of Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 alias 'sarge' the security [support](https://www.debian.org/security/) for the old stable distribution 3.0 will
be terminated at the end of June 2006. Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 alias 'woody' has
been released nearly four years ago on July 19th 2002.


**Improving Debian's Publicity.** Andreas Barth [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2006/06/msg00000.html)
that there were somewhat
suboptimal news in the press about Debian in the past. It seems that
journalists did pick up postings which were primarily targeted at Debian
developers and wrote articles about with
misleading information. Andreas wondered how to improve this situation,
probably by offering direct phone contact to our developers for the
journalists.


**Debian Conference 6: Hot, spicy and working hard.** Robin
Miller [reported](http://business.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=06/05/22/1240231) that this year's [Debconf](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0514-debconf) brought close to 300 Debian developers, package maintainers, and
other interested parties to Mexico. A lot of work was aimed at making Debian
more user-friendly. Holger Levsen and several others shot high definition
video of most DebConf6 presentations which will be available on the [meetings-archive](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/) server soon.


**Automatic Debian Installation with Pre-Seeding.** Carla
Schroder [explained](http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netsysm/article.php/3606721) how to generate a quick 'n' dirty preseed configuration file for
replicating a Debian installation, and how to perform a minimal custom
installation with a USB stick. She continued to [explain](http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netos/article.php/3608361) how to start a network installation with either a new USB stick or
an old CD-ROM, or an even more antique 3.5" diskette.


**Debian IRC moves to OFTC.** The Debian project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2006/20060604) that it has moved the
irc.debian.org alias to the [Open and Free
Technology Community](http://www.oftc.net/) (OFTC). This move was done in recognition of many
discussions taking place there already. OFTC is also a sister organisation of
Debian, as both are supported and represented by [Software in the Public Interest, Inc](https://www.spi-inc.org/). The
Debian project has been using the [Freenode](https://freenode.net/) IRC network for many years.


**Failed Release Architecture Qualification.** Andreas Barth
[reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/06/msg00038.html) about three architectures that were released with Debian [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) which currently do not meet the
requirements for inclusion in [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/). Some
sub-architectures of [m68k](https://www.debian.org/ports/m68k/) still require the
2.2 or 2.4 kernel which are not supported anymore. The [s390](https://www.debian.org/ports/s390/) port lacks a sufficient number of
developers. The [sparc](https://www.debian.org/ports/sparc/) port lacks kernel
support. Help for these ports is highly appreciated.


**New Debian Menu Structure.** Bill Allombert [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00133.html)
a new Debian menu structure devised by Linas Zvirblis. Several sections have
been renamed and a number of sub-sections have been created to reflect the
large number of new applications. Developers should check whether their
current menu files still fit into the new structure and adjust the section if
not.


**Delivering Mails for System Users?** Andreas Metzler [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00153.html)
if it would be safe to reject any mail for system accounts based on the user
id unless it is redirected via `/etc/aliases`. Wouter Verhelst [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00192.html) that other distributions start with a lower uid for real users.
Stephen Samuel [confirmed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00209.html) that this would cause problems in a hybrid environment.


**Debian Light Desktop.** AndrÃ© Luiz Rodrigues Ferreira [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00236.html)
working on a desktop meta package for desktop machines running old hardware.
He [received](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00334.html) several improvements. Joey Hess would like to [add](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00301.html) this
to [tasksel](https://packages.debian.org/tasksel), so that the
desktop task automatically installs it if it detects a system that is not
easily capable of running KDE/GNOME.


**Reforming the New-Maintainer Process.** Marc Brockschmidt [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/04/msg00006.html) to stiffen the requirements for prospective maintainers by
adding a second advocate and increasing the amount of packaging they
must have already accomplished in the past.
This way the applicant is more into Debian when
they apply. He also suggested to separate upload permissions, system accounts
and voting rights which would mean a reform of the Debian project.
