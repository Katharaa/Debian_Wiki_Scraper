Debian Weekly News - April 18th, 2006
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 16th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. We congratulate the new project leader (DPL), Anthony
Towns. Holger Levsen [announced](http://layer-acht.org/blog/debian/#1-14) updated [videos](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2006/debian-edu-erkelenz/) from the last Skolelinux meeting as Ogg theoras. For the first
time the videos themselves contain a copyright and author note.


**Debian Project Leader Election.** Manoj Srivastava [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/04/msg00004.html) Anthony Towns as the winner of this year's project leader [election](https://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_002) whose term started on April
17th. In total 421 developers have casted a ballot. Anthony [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/04/msg00152.html)
afterwards that the general philosophy he is aiming to follow is that there's
very little you can do as DPL that you can't do as a regular developer.


**Experimental Autobuilder.** Wouter Verhelst [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/04/msg00007.html) that automatically building packages in the
`experimental` distribution is a bit of a special case, which means
that our `experimental` autobuilders act slightly differently compared to other
distributions. Only properly versioned build-dependencies will be pulled in
from `experimental` and taken from `unstable`
otherwise.


**Debian Python Modules Team.** RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/04/msg00008.html) that the Debian Python Modules Team has been created to
collaboratively maintain packages of Python modules. They have prepared a [policy](http://python-modules.alioth.debian.org/python-modules-policy.html) already and invite all maintainers of Python modules to join the
team.


**X11 Release 7 Transition.** Steve Langasek [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/04/msg00010.html) that X.Org 7.0 alias X11R7 has been uploaded into [unstable](https://www.debian.org/releases/sid/) and that it brought a few bugs with
it. As a result the X11R6 hierarchy is going away and new programs are
installed in `/usr/bin` instead. Static library packages have also
been dropped.


**Reforming the New Maintainer Process.** Marc Brockschmidt [summarised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/04/msg00163.html) his experiences of the current process. Some problems and
delays are caused by the lack of interested people working as application
managers. He proposed to raise the requirements before applying and to
separate upload permissions, system accounts and voting rights.


**On Generating Revenue.** Annamalai Gurusami [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/04/msg00221.html)
why the Debian project doesn't sell CDs and generate revenue. Don Armstrong
[explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/04/msg00240.html) that the Debian project is a non-profit organisation and that
other entities are more used to the complications of taxes and the economics
of making and selling CDs and DVDs. Paul Johnson [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/04/msg00244.html)
that it's better to donate to Debian directly instead of purchasing a product
of which only a fraction of the price goes to the project.


**Package Removal Problems.** Lars Wirzenius [summarised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg00693.html) the top 10 problems he discovered in Debian packages using the
[piuparts](https://packages.debian.org/piuparts) utility that
performs automatic installation and de-installation of packages. Gustavo
Franco [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg00984.html) to add checks to [linda](https://packages.debian.org/linda) and [lintian](https://packages.debian.org/lintian) that
could detect some of these problems earlier.


**License Meta Information.** Jari Aalto [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg00766.html) to add a new field to the control file that contains the
abbreviation of the used license. Martin WÃ¼rtele [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg00769.html) that this information is already available on [packages.debian.org](https://packages.debian.org/) without the need to
download the entire package. JÃ¶rg Jaspert [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg00778.html)
that such a field would not even ease NEW processing.


**Marking BTS SPAM.** Shaun Jackman [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg00811.html)
if it would be possible to mark spam sent via the [bug
tracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/) (BTS). Don Armstrong [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg00812.html) that a button with a similar functionality already exists on the web
pages for bug reports. Additionally, Javier FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino PeÃ±a [provided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/02/msg01213.html)
a [Mutt](https://packages.debian.org/mutt) configuration snippet for
reporting list spam via mail.


**Changes to the unofficial AMD64 Archive.** JÃ¶rg Jaspert [informed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/04/msg00005.html) about a functional change on [amd64.debian.net](http://amd64.debian.net/), which maintains an unofficial port of Debian for the [AMD64](https://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/) platform. Since the recent
inclusion of AMD64 as an officially supported platform there is no need
for an unofficial AMD64 build daemon anymore. Users of testing or
unstable should switch over to an official [mirror](https://www.debian.org/mirrors/list), users of sarge,
the current stable release, are not affected by this change.
