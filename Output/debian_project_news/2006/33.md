Debian Weekly News - August 15th, 2006
======================================


Welcome to this year's 33rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Debian turns 13 this week, so make sure you find a [party](https://wiki.debian.org/Debian13th) nearby. With enough time
compose a melody before the new release Julien
Danjou [published](http://julien.danjou.info/blog/index.php/2006/08/01/312-etch-song) his etch song. David Sugar [wondered](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1692) if the Free
Software community should learn to write more buggy code and invent reasons to
reboot the system all the time after a change has been made in order to be
more attractive for the desktop.


**Distribution-wide Tracker Tool.** Arnaud Fontaine [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2006/08/msg00039.html)
about the status of Wotomae, the [distribution-wide tracker tool](https://wiki.debian.org/DWTT). The DWTT is a tool to easily track
changes affecting packages, like a library transition, a switch of the default
Python version or a policy change. It is written during Google's [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html). A demo
website is also [available](http://netu.naquadah.org:8080/) with
most of the features up for testing.


**New Version Naming for Pre-Releases.** Martin F. Krafft [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/08/msg00006.html) that the archive software finally supports the use of the tilde
('~') in version numbers. This special character is intended to be used to
denote pre-releases of software. It is sorted before the zero-length string,
so that version `1.0~rc4-1` will be superseded by the final version
`1.0-1`. The build daemon software can't cope with this new
character yet, though.


**Release Update: First Packages frozen.** Andreas Barth [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/08/msg00005.html) that the essential toolchain has been [frozen](https://release.debian.org/britney/hints/freeze). He is
also seeking input for the release notes and asks library maintainers to talk
to the release team before uploading new packages that may require other
packages to be rebuilt. They are still seeing many uncoordinated uploads to
unstable.


**Status of the Python Transition.** Matthias Klose [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/08/msg00004.html) that the default version of Python will soon be changed to
version 2.4. He reported that 90 % of the first batch of bug reports are
solved and that another batch has been filed against all remaining packages
that contain private Python modules, which mostly need to be byte-compiled
again. The preliminary [documentation](https://people.debian.org/~doko/tmp/python-rtupdate.txt) explains the scripts running during this change.


**Debian turns 13.** On August 16th, 1993 Ian Murdock [announced](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.development/msg/a32d4e2ef3bcdcc6?output=gplain) a new type of distribution and listed the goals he wanted to
achieve. 13 years later the Debian community will [celebrate](https://wiki.debian.org/Debian13th) this birthday around
the world. A lot has happened since Ian's first mail: The project is lead by
its ninth leader and more than a thousand developers are registered to work
voluntarily on one of the largest distributions of Free Software.


**Project Leader Report.** Anthony Towns published a new [report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/08/msg00007.html) in which he resumes the past. Steve McIntyre has been added to the
leader alias and helps managing the project. He reported about two women who
became developers recently, thanked the organisers of this year's [Debian conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0514-debconf), explained
delays for the next stable update, and reported on a meeting with the
Australian Attorney-General's department regarding the drafting of changes to
the Australian copyright act.


**Debian-Installer Etch Beta 3 Released.** Frans Pop [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/08/msg00009.html) the release of the third beta release of the installer for
Debian GNU/Linux etch. It is the first release to install the AMD64
architecture from official Debian mirrors and to use and install the
2.6.16 kernel. 2.6 is now the default kernel for the
[Sparc](https://www.debian.org/ports/sparc),
[MIPS](https://www.debian.org/ports/mips), [little endian MIPS](https://www.debian.org/ports/mipsel) and
[S/390](https://www.debian.org/ports/s390) architectures.
Installation CDs, other media and detailed errata are [available](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/). All
changes are documented in the development version of the [installation guide](https://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual).
