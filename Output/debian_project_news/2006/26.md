Debian Weekly News - June 27th, 2006
====================================


Welcome to this year's 26th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Alan Baghumian [announced](http://lists.parsix.org/?0::737) a [new version](http://lists.parsix.org/?0::803) of
[Parsix](http://www.parsix.org/) a
special Debian-based live and installation CD with Persian support. Joey Schulze [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2006/06/msg00238.html)
that an [RSS feed](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/dwn.en.rdf) for the [weekly news](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/) is generated automatically,
including translations for the current issue.


**Debian Query Language.** Berke Durak from the French
National [Institute](http://www.inria.fr/) for Research in Computer
Science and Control is [seeking](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg01912.html)
feedback and ideas for defining a query language that would be useful to
maintainers, power-users and researchers. They have already developed a [dependency checker](https://bugs.debian.org/365087) based on Boolean
form. Tools for handling the Debian meta data with its evolution in time
are also being implemented.


**Date of last Modification.** Kai Hendry [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy/2006/06/msg00070.html)
that policy's date [field](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields#s-f-Date) is
poorly implemented on `/var/lib/dpkg/available`. Relying instead
on the changelog date for package activity can sometimes be incorrect as some
developers may not update the date on their final change [accordingly](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy/2006/06/msg00033.html).
Joey Hess stepped in and [recommended](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg00529.html)
the use of `dch -r` to update the changelog timestamp when
continuing work on packages.


**Priorities of Alternatives.** Wouter Verhelst [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg02136.html)
why package maintainers are allowed to choose the priority for
alternatives. Naturally they are biased, as demonstrated with
`mcedit` becoming the default for `/usr/bin/editor`.
Using [popularity contest](https://popcon.debian.org/) instead would
ensure that the applications which most people prefer would be the default.


**Improving Debian's Publicity.** RaphaÃ«l
Hertzog [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/06/msg00005.html) the creation of the [debian-publicity](https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/)
mailing list. It aims at helping the press team by preparing
and suggesting announcements and reviving the [press clipping](https://www.debian.org/News/press/) section of the project's
website. It can also be a place to help Debian
developers in drafting announcements intended for the [debian-news](https://lists.debian.org/debian-news/)
mailing list. This initiative is one of the conclusions of the [Representing Debian](https://debconf6.debconf.org/comas/general/proposals/66) meeting held at this year's Debian [conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0514-debconf). Assistance by
non-technical people would be greatly appreciated.


**Tracking Critical Bugs.** Andreas Barth [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/06/msg00011.html) some enhancements in his bts2ldap interface for
[tracking critical issues](http://bts.turmzimmer.net/) in
Debian packages. The interface now takes into account the version of the
package a bug appeared or was resolved in. Steinar H. Gunderson then
[made](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg00869.html) many suggestions to improve tracking the resolution
state of bugs in the Debian [Bug
Tracking System](https://bugs.debian.org/), for example by making the official release-critical bug [graph](https://bugs.debian.org/release-critical)
use the versioning information.


**Separating shared Libraries and Executables.** Goswin von
Brederlow [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg02166.html)
that [policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs#s-sharedlibs-runtime-progs) demands that run-time support programs using a shared library must
not be put in the shared library package. This would prevent the installation
of more than one version of the shared library. Goswin [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg02429.html)
that it would also complicate a conversion to [multiarch](https://multiarch.alioth.debian.org/multiarch-hp-report.pdf).


**Debian in Cuba.** David Moreno Garza [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/06/msg00268.html)
that he has been invited to go to Cuba to support some of Cuban Free Software
initiatives, which some of them are Debian-based. Walter Landry [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/06/msg00274.html)
that it used to be illegal under US law to export crypto to any country, which
has been relaxed though, but does not include Cuba. According to Walter, some
types of communication are allowed, but some are not and even using the
mailing list infrastructure may be a problem for Debian.


**Automatic Loading of Kernel Modules.** Jim Popovitch [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-isp/2006/06/msg00109.html)
that the default installation of Debian loads many more kernel modules than he
needs and wondered how to prevent this. Robert Sanchez [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-isp/2006/06/msg00116.html)
that the system probably has some auto-detection running which automatically
load modules for the hardware they have discovered.


**Stopping Daemons upon Removal.** Michael Prokop [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg02437.html)
about maintainer scripts that fail when they can't stop the daemon process
they try to. Henrique de Moraes Holschuh [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg02470.html)
that stop targets are to exit with a zero exit code 0 if the service is
already stopped. Bert Schubert [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg02483.html)
that the proper solution for `chroot` environments is to add a
`policy-rc.d` script and gave an example.


**Private List Messages sent to Google Mail.** Ian Jackson [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg02531.html)
that the current privacy and processing policies of Google Mail are not
compatible with Debian's policy for its private list. In his opinion Google
should not get a copy of debian-private, even if the only current output is
aggregate keyword hit reports.


**TrueCrypt Licensing.** Karl Goetz [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/06/msg00294.html)
if the [license](http://www.truecrypt.org/license.php) of the
popular multi-platform disc encryption software [TrueCrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/) is free enough to allow
distributing it with Debian. Michael Poole [answered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/06/msg00295.html)
that the license isn't free at all because there are a lot of unclear and
imprecise paragraphs which makes it impossible to distribute TrueCrypt within
Debian.
