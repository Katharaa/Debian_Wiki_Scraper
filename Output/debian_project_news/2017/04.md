Internal News/Happenings
------------------------


**Updated Debian 9: 9.2 released**



The second update of the stable distribution Debian 9 Stretch was
[published](https://www.debian.org/News/2017/20171007) on 7 October 2017.
This update mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable
release, along with a few adjustments for serious problems.




After the 9.2.0 release was made and published, a bug was found
with the sorting of packages in the full DVD, BD and DLBD sets
(other images were not affected).
The 9.2.1 build fixes this bug, and the build scripts have also been updated
to ensure this cannot happen again in future.
For more details about this, see
[the related note at the
images download server](https://get.debian.org/images/release/9.2.1/).



**OpenSSL 1.0 and Qt4 removal in Buster**



For the next release, Debian 10 Buster, it's planned to remove OpenSSL 1.0,
the old version of the toolkit for the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols, in favour of the more modern OpenSSL 1.1 version.
Meanwhile, Debian Qt/KDE Maintainers are also actively working
to remove Qt4, which is long dead upstream. Lisandro DamiÃ¡n Nicanor PÃ©rez Meyer,
for the Debian Qt/KDE Team, has
[blogged](https://perezmeyer.blogspot.com.es/2017/10/qt-4-and-5-and-oepnssl10-removal.html)
about the specific plans related to the OpenSSL support for Qt4 and Qt5 applications in Debian.



**FTP services shutdown**



As previously [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2017/20170425),
the public-facing debian.org FTP services shut down on November 1, 2017.
Debian Developers can use FTP for the uploads to the security archive at
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue`.
More details and other options at
<https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/10/msg00000.html>.



**DebConf mailing lists moved to lists.debian.org**



In order to simplify infrastructure and maintenance, the DebConf mailing lists
have been moved to lists.debian.org (including their archives and subscriptions).
Appropriate redirections have been put in place, but it is recommended for everybody
to update any documentation or bookmarks with the new addresses or web links.
Read the [blog post](http://blog.snow-crash.org/blog/debconf-mailinglists-moved-to-lists.debian.org/)
from Alexander Wirt for more details.
