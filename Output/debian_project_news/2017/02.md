Welcome to the Debian Project News!
-----------------------------------


We hope that you are enjoying this edition of DPN.


This issue is brought to you from DebConf17 in Montreal by the now extended group of Debian Project News editors. So we expect
DPN will see more frequent releases in the future.


For other news, please read the official Debian blog
[Bits from Debian](https://bits.debian.org), and follow
<https://micronews.debian.org> which
feeds (via-RSS) the @debian profile on several social networks.


Debian's Security Team releases current advisories on a daily basis
([Security Advisories 2017](https://www.debian.org/security/2017/)). Please
read them carefully and subscribe to the [security mailing
 list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/).


At the end of this Project News we've added a **Quick Links** section which
links to a selection of the posts made through our other media streams
during the last months.


Internal News/Happenings
------------------------


**New DPL**


In April, Chris Lamb [was
elected](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/04/msg00011.html) as the new Debian Project Leader. Chris has already
posted several monthly updates on his work as DPL, for
[April](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/04/msg00015.html),
[May](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/05/msg00006.html),
[June](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/07/msg00000.html) and
[July](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/08/msg00000.html).


**Stretch released**


In June, we welcomed
[the release of Debian 9](https://www.debian.org/News/2017/20170722)
(codename stretch). If you haven't upgraded your systems yet,
you might like to do so soon to enjoy the improvements in the new
release. Security support for the old Debian 8 release is expected to be available
[until around June 2018](https://www.debian.org/security/faq#lifespan).



A group of CD set images have been dropped in this release, in favor of
the DVD sets and netinst ISOs. With Stretch, several images for usage in
different cloud providers are available too.



**DebConf17 in Montreal, videos online**


DebConf17, the annual Debian conference, has just been held in Montreal.
We have been enjoying many interesting talks and productive discussions.
Videos of many talks are already available by visiting the talks' individual pages
linked from [the schedule](https://debconf17.debconf.org/schedule/ ).
Read [the
article in the Debian blog](https://bits.debian.org/2017/08/debconf17-closes.html) about DebConf17 for more details (including the group photo!).



**DebCamp**


Before the main conference started, some Debian teams gathered
for the DebCamp week of work sessions and discussions.
The Debian Perl Group held a Rolling Sprint at DebCamp, and
the teams for OpenStack, pkg-emacsen and Debian Policy
also held meetings and sprints.
DebCamp17 may have been the biggest DebCamp ever, with 117 attendees.


**Chinese translation of the Debian website**



The Chinese language team has been relaunched with new contributors,
and the Debian Installer, many pages in the Debian website, and other
documents are being updated and translated into Chinese.
If you want to join this effort, ask in
[the Chinese
language team mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-chinese) for details.

**Discussions**


In July 2017, Debian user Rainer Dorsch asked,

when he was trying to perform comparisons (less than/greater than) in the shell.
Darac Marjal
[explained](https://lists.debian.org/msgid-search/20170706085750.uyron62iu6saipa3@darac.org.uk)
what was going on, and TomÃ¡s
[elaborated](https://lists.debian.org/msgid-search/20170706095044.GA24817@tuxteam.de) on that.



**Tips and Tricks**



Jose M. Calhariz has published a series of blogposts about
[crossgrading](https://wiki.debian.org/CrossGrading), starting with small tasks and
evolving to a real-life example:
