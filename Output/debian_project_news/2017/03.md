**The future of Alioth**



[Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org), the Debian forge,

On 18–20 August 2017 a sprint was held in Hamburg, Germany, to discuss
options and the future of the several services currently provided by Alioth.
A service based in GitLab is being worked on as the future git service.
As for the mailing lists hosted on lists.alioth.debian.org, some of them will be
retired and others are elegible to be moved to the lists.debian.org service.
See the [related mail
about mailing lists](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/09/msg00004.html) for how to proceed, and

Reports

**Debian Day 2017 in Brazil and the rest of the world**


From August 16 to 23, 2017,
[seven cities in Brazil](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay/2017)
organised meetings to celebrate the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Debian
Project, and some of them have photos:


* [Curitiba](https://www.flickr.com/photos/curitibalivre/sets/72157685044712731)
* Francisco BeltrÃ£o
* [MaceiÃ³](http://debianbrasil.org.br/debian-day-2017-em-maceio)
* Natal
* [Recife](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipO9F2PQwp69CHbtECZb1OPHJCW7bpsy5fqc82XD8n_4KO6wLcKkWOE2bRJq0pXASQ?key=Qzh1U0NHMjlTd29haE9hVkY2WXBnbWptRGpQNjNB)
* Salvador
* SÃ£o Paulo


In [2016](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay/2016) only two
Brazilian cities organised a Debian Day. This year we had an increase in
the number of cities because we encouraged the local communities to organise
their meetings.



Other cities in the world celebrating this Debian birthday were: Varese (Italy),
La Paz (Bolivia), Montreal and Quebec (Canada), Stockholm (Sweden), Caracas and CumanÃ¡ (Venezuela).

Help needed
-----------


**Help spreading the word about Debian Astro 1.0**



[Debian Astro](https://blends.debian.org/astro/) was released
last June together with Debian Stretch.
Let's help to make Debian Astro 1.0 known to the astronomy community!
If you happen to attend any astronomy related conference or meeting,
don't hesitate to talk to your colleagues about this
[Debian Pure Blend](https://www.debian.org/blends/)
focused for both professional and hobby astronomers,
and the [software packages](https://blends.debian.org/astro/tasks)
covering telescope control, data reduction, presentation and other fields.



**Devscripts needs you**



James McCoy has [blogged](https://jamessan.com/~jamessan//posts/devscripts-needs-you/)
about help needed for maintaining **devscripts**, a set of scripts to make the life of a Debian Package Maintainer easier.
If you're interested in helping out, you can join #devscripts on OFTC and/or send a mail to the list devscripts-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org.



**A Debian theme for the Debian Policy (and other documentation)**


The Debian Policy team is seeking volunteers to design a Debian documentation
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) theme, to be used by the
Debian Policy versions 4.1.0.0 and newer and probably other core pieces of
Debian documentation as they move to the Sphinx documentation generator.
Contact the [Debian Policy Team](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Policy)
to submit your proposal, or the [Debian Design Team](https://wiki.debian.org/Design)
for more design work needed in Debian.



**Packages needing help**


[Currently](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/09/msg00213.html) [1112 packages are orphaned](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/orphaned) and [154 packages are up for adoption](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/rfa): please visit the complete list of [packages which need your help](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/help_requested).


**Newcomer bugs**



Debian has a newcomer bug tag, used to indicate bugs which are suitable for new
contributors to use as an entry point to working on specific packages.
There are [205](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=newcomer)
bugs available tagged newcomer.



More than just code
-------------------

**New translation team: Albanian**



The second edition of Free Libre Open Source Camp (FOSScamp)
took place from 31 August to 03 September 2017 in Syros, Greece.
The Debian Developer Lior Kaplan attended and facilitated the localisation
of Debian installer and other software into Albanian. See the blogposts about
[this](https://liorkaplan.wordpress.com/2017/09/03/fosscamp-syros-2017-day-1/) and
[other](https://liorkaplan.wordpress.com/2017/09/04/fosscamp-syros-2017-day-2/) good
[outcomes](https://liorkaplan.wordpress.com/2017/09/07/fosscamp-syros-2017-day-3/) of the event.
Albanian translators are continuing the work using the
newly created [debian-l10n-albanian mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-albanian/).

Outside News
------------


**Public Money, Public Code**



The Free Software Foundation Europe has recently launched the campaign
[Public Money, Public Code](https://publiccode.eu/),
to request the implementation of legislation requiring that publicly financed
software developed for the public sector be made publicly available under a
Free and Open Source Software licence.



Forty organisations, Debian among them, and more than 7,400 individuals have supported
this call for action by signing the
[open letter](https://publiccode.eu/openletter/) of the campaign.
Visit the website <https://publiccode.eu>
to learn more details, sign the letter, and find other ways of taking action or
spreading the word.


**Videos in Portuguese from Free Software Events**


The Debian Maintainer Paulo Santana (phls) created the website
<http://videos.softwarelivre.org>
to index videos of lectures in Portuguese from Free Software events in Brazil like
[MiniDebConf Curitiba 2017](http://videos.softwarelivre.org/eventos/minidebconf-curitiba-2017.html).
