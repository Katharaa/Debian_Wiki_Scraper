Jessie coming soon!
-------------------


Niels Thykier of the Debian Release team made the [official announcement](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/03/msg00016.html) of a
target release date of Saturday 25 April for Debian 8 Jessie! The date
although announced is still subject to change for critical issues, but otherwise we
are moving into the final stages for release. There will be a quiet period
starting Saturday 18 April; all bug fixes must be in before then.
There is still time to work on and apply fixes, so don't be shy!


The Debian Installer team [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/03/msg00015.html) the second release candidate of the
installer for Jessie. Several improvements were made to brltty-udeb,
console-setup, and tasksel, among other things. Hardware support is also improved,
with the installer providing u-boot binaries for armhf systems without u-boot in flash,
and grub2 support for running the 64-bit Linux kernel on a 32-bit EFI.
There is full translation for 19 of the 75 languages supported.


Steve McIntyre gave a [final update](http://blog.einval.com/2015/03/30#Jessie-EFI_6) to his UEFI Debian installer work for Jessie
to say that all improvements were committed. The latest release candidate works just
as well as the test builds.


Reports
-------



Ulrike Uhlig [detailed](http://apparmor.451f.org/2015/03/09/final-report/) quite extensively her work towards
improving AppArmor support in Debian, as part of her final report on the latest segment of Debian's involvement in the
Outreach Program for Women. She wrote about [first
starting](https://apparmor.451f.org/2014/12/23/how-does-my-apparmor-profile-get-into-debian/) with [AppArmor](http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Main_Page) and
her learning curve both with it and with Debian, sharing the maturation process
from being uncomfortable at first to later [authoring documentation](https://apparmor.451f.org/2014/12/23/how-to-contribute-to-the-apparmor-upstream-profiles/) on how
others could contribute. Although the internship has ended the work continues as
she still plans on contributing as a member of the AppArmor Packaging Team.



Gregor Herrmann [gave an update](http://info.comodo.priv.at/blog/rc_bugs_2015_07_10.html) on RC bugs he worked on towards Jessie's release.


Freexianâs Debian Long Term Support [report](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/03/17/freexians-report-about-debian-long-term-support-february-2015/)
for February 2015 detailed how 58 paid work hours were divided between the four contributors. [Ben Hutchings](http://www.decadent.org.uk/ben/blog/debian-lts-work-february-2015.html) worked on
linux-2.6 version 2.6.32-48squeeze11, userland, and security updates. [Holger Levsen](http://layer-acht.org/thinking/blog/20150310-lts-february-2015/)
worked on the security tracker package. [RaphaÃ«l Hertzog](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/03/06/my-free-software-activities-in-february-2015/) worked mostly on CVE
triage with 41 commits to the tracker, a helper script for that process, and a
sponsorship of e2fsprogs. [Thorsten Alteholz](http://blog.alteholz.eu/2015/03/my-debian-activities-in-february-2015/) uploaded new versions of
php5 (fixing a regression), krb5, unzip, and binutils.


Calls For Help
--------------



The AppArmor Packaging Team is asking for volunteers and interested parties to
please [help improve AppArmor support in Debian](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/03/msg00008.html). They currently need help with
documentation and bug reports.




Are you good at graphic design or artwork? There are several projects right
now that [need artwork](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianArt/RequestArtwork) such as JuggleMaster which needs icons, the Debian wiki
which needs a community icon, and the LTS group which needs a logo.



The Debian Installer team asks for feedback and for help finding bugs and to
further improve the installer.


Interviews
----------


Zlatan TodoriÄ interviewed [Laura Arjona](http://zgrimshell.github.io/interviews-with-floss-developers-laura-arjona/) as part of a series on FLOSS developers.
Laura talked about applying to become a Debian Developer, her future plans in
Debian, self-hosting, and administration.


Next in the series was an interview with [Francesca Ciceri](http://zgrimshell.github.io/interviews-with-floss-developers-francesca-ciceri/) who shared some
history of the non-packaging Debian Developer role, her journey in Debian
through various teams, and how she came to be the voice of Debian's diversity.


[Stefano Zacchiroli](http://stefano.zacchiroli.usesthis.com/) was interviewed by [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/) where he details the equipment
and software that a computer researcher and Debian Developer uses for getting
 the job done. He [followed up](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2015/03/interview_for_The_Setup/) with a small commentary and thank you.


Other news
----------



Following a vote and change to our constitution regarding [term limits for Technical Committee members](https://www.debian.org/vote/2014/vote_004) and the manner in which those positions will
expire, new appointments were [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/03/msg00003.html) for Sam Hartman, Tollef Fog Heen, and
Didier Raboud.



A recap of [miscellaneous developer news](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/03/msg00004.html).


* Gitorious and Codehaus will be closing soon. [Gitorious](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/03/03/gitlab-acquires-gitorious/) will shut down at the
end of May and [Codehaus](https://codehaus.org/) will be removing projects from April 2 onwards.
* There is currently a queue of prospective Debian members waiting for
Application Managers (AMs). If you would like to help please contact the
[New Members Front Desk](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/FrontDesk).
* check-all-the-things is a tool to check all of the things related to an unpacked
or post-build source package or VCS repository. It will [soon be available](https://ftp-master.debian.org/new/check-all-the-things_2015.02.04.html) in
experimental and can be checked out from collab-maint git.
* Debian's hardware donations wishlist has moved to the Debian wiki to allow all
Debian contributors to add their Debian-related hardware wishlists. If you have
a need for hardware to enable your work on Debian, please [add an entry](https://wiki.debian.org/Hardware/Wanted#add) to the
wiki so that hardware donors can contact you about it.
* There has been a change in how the [SSL certificate configuration](https://lists.debian.org/debian-services-admin/2015/01/msg00002.html) is
organised on debian.org hosts. Going forward, DSA-administered machines do not trust any CA certs and will only trust SSL certs for debian.org services.


Upcoming events
---------------


There are several upcoming Debian-related events:


* Reminder: [Bug Squashing party](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/03/msg00121.html) in Salzburg, Austria, 17-19 April 2015.

Ignoring bugs which are easily solved or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about 40 Release-Critical bugs remain to be solved for the release to happen.
