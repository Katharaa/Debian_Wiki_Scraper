Debian Project News - October 22nd, 2015
========================================


Welcome to this year's eight issue of DPN, the newsletter for the Debian community. Topics covered in this issue include:


* [Welcome to the New Debian Project News!](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2015/08/#newdpn)
* [Internal News/Happenings](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2015/08/#internal)
* [Calls for help!](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2015/08/#help)
* [More than just code](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2015/08/#namesuggestionneeded)
* [Reports](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2015/08/#reports)

Welcome to the New Debian Project News!
---------------------------------------


We hope that you enjoy our first newly revised issue of DPN. We have shifted
some of the content around, introduced new sections, and moved some content
onto the [Bits from Debian](https://bits.debian.org/) blog.


Bits from Debian will showcase new packages and interviews, plus some announcements,
and is where we will welcome new DDs.


We are planning to send more short news items via our social network account.
Please be sure to follow us on [identi.ca/debian](https://identi.ca/debian)
(or fall back to the non-official mirrors in other social networks).


One of the major changes is the removal of the DSA security advisories from
the newsletter. Debian's Security Team releases current advisories on a daily
basis ([Security Advisories 2015](https://www.debian.org/security/2015/)), so
please read them carefully and take the proper measures.


If you need to be kept up to date about security advisories released by the
Debian Security Team, please
subscribe to the [security mailing
list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) (and the separate [backports
list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-backports-announce/), [stable updates
list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-stable-announce/), and [long term
support security updates list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/)) for announcements.



We are simplifying and (we hope) improving the help needed section.
From now on, you will find:


* links to packages needing help,
* links to bug reports tagged newcomer,
* calls for help from teams in coordination with the Welcome Team,
 tailored for first-time contributors.


Internal News/Happenings
------------------------


Joerg Jaspert [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/08/msg00009.html) that Squeeze non-LTS architectures were moved to

They have [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/09/msg00000.html)

Debian review efforts](https://wiki.debian.org/WhoUsesDebian), now in the Education subsection.


The DebConf Team is working on writing the
[DebConf15
Final Report](https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf15/FinalReport), and some sections are almost ready, content-wise; for example
[DebConf15 in Numbers](https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf15/FinalReport/InNumbers)
(contact the DebConf Team if you could help with transforming the stats into nice infographics) and the
[Attendee Impressions](https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf15/FinalReport/AttendeeImpressions)
(a comprehensive list of links of blogposts about DebConf15, including some quotes).


Look how the time has flown!
[Christoph
Berg](http://www.df7cb.de/blog/2015/10_Years_Debian_Developer.html) recounts 10 years as a Debian Developer and
[Dirk

The delegations for the Publicity Team have been [updated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/09/msg00007.html) and the team
[restructured](https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2015/08/msg00032.html).
The new Publicity Team will handle social media, blogging, press
releases, announcements, the DPN, and Debian Press functions.

Calls for help!
---------------


**Translators and reviewers needed!**


Help us make Debian (the software, the community) speak your language!
Less than an hour every once in a while - even just a couple of
minutes - can make a difference. 


If you speak a language other than English, you can join the team for
your language and contribute to Debian with translations
and reviews of other people's translations. 


Reviewing translations made by other contributors is particularly needed
(to ensure their quality) and easy (no technical skills needed, just language skills).



More information and contact details at the
[Welcome Translators](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Welcome/Translators) wiki page.



**Packages needing help**


[Currently](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/10/msg00179.html) [671 packages are orphaned](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/orphaned) and [178 packages are up for adoption](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/rfa): please visit the complete list of [packages which need your help](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/help_requested).


**Newcomer bugs**



Debian has a newcomer bug tag used to indicate bugs which are suitable
for new contributors to use as an entry point to working on specific packages.




There are [158](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=newcomer) newcomer bugs available.



More than just code

new version of Hercules, a z/Architecture emulator.
