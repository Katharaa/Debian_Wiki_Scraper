Debian 8 Jessie is released
---------------------------



On April 25, the Debian project
[released](https://www.debian.org/News/2015/20150426) a
[new
stable version](https://bits.debian.org/2015/04/jessie-released.html), Debian 8 Jessie.
Niels Thykier, member of the Release team,
[gave a summary
on his blog](https://nthykier.wordpress.com/2015/05/02/the-release-of-debian-jessie-from-an-rms-pov/) of the release process for Jessie seen from the inside.




The release of Debian Jessie was accompanied by
[the
first beta release](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu-announce/2015/04/msg00000.html) of the Jessie-based
[DebianEdu](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu) and the publication
of [Debian
GNU/Hurd 2015](https://lists.debian.org/20150429224658.GN4713@type.home), a snapshot of Debian unstable at the time of Jessie's
release, for the unofficial Hurd port.




As with the
[Wheezy
release](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/04/msg00870.html), Michael Prokop
[started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/04/msg00382.html)
the New in Jessie game, and invited all Debian contributors to advertise
their new packages present in the brand new Debian stable release.
He started with a list of
[forensics
packages](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/04/msg00382.html) and
[tools related to RPM packages](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2015/05/04/the-newinjessie-game-tools-related-to-rpm-packages/).




Dominique Dumont
[presented](https://ddumont.wordpress.com/2015/04/25/the-newinjessie-game-automatic-configuration-upgrade-and-other-stuff-in-debianjessie/)
some progress in automatic configuration upgrades in the
[lcdproc](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/lcdproc)
package and other new packages.
Jonathan McCrohan
[wrote
about](http://dereenigne.org/debian/new-packages-in-debian-8-0-jessie) his new packages
[dtv-scan-tables](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/dtv-scan-tables)
and
[git-remote-hg](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/git-remote-hg),
and the packages he updated.
Paul Wise
[highlighted](http://bonedaddy.net/pabs3/log/2015/05/05/newinjessie-dev-qa-tools/)
some new developer and QA tools available in Jessie.
The Debian Multimedia team published
[a detailed report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/10/msg00005.html) some time ago listing the new multimedia applications
shipped with Jessie.
Andreas Tille also [mentioned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/04/msg00408.html)
that during Jessie's development cycle, some packages were freed, moving
from non-free to the main part of the archive. The Debian Med
team for example freed
[phylip](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/phylip)
and
[seaview](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/seaview).




This initiative was mentioned by Michael during a
[lightning
talk](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2015/04/28/glt15-slides-of-my-debian-8-aka-jessie-whats-new-talk/) he was giving about Debian Jessie during the [Linuxdays](https://linuxtage.at/) in Graz on the day of its release.



Publicity live coverage
-----------------------


Much like the larger project that houses it, the publicity team is also an
international effort relying on contributors, developers, and volunteers across
the world in nearly every timezone to accomplish a singular task.


For the release of Debian 8 Jessie we did our traditional live coverage
across several timezones and facets of social media as members of the publicity
team passed the social media torch to another waiting member of the team from
Europe to the Americas to Australia.


The coverage of the release started earlier in the week on social media and as
the excitement built an announcement was made that the release team was waking
up and getting their tea and coffee in preparation for #releasingjessie. The
coverage picked up from that point and continued throughout release day and
well into the evening until finally the message heard around the world was:
Debian 8.0 Jessie has been released! There is a new sheriff in town. And her
name is Jessie!


Although we celebrated with everyone else at the posting of the news, we did not
stop there: we further posted tips about the new release, advice, facts about
Debian, and the history of the project.


We learned a lot about how such a release can be handled in the future. We were
able to work dynamically with many of the other teams in Debian and have those
teams work inside of our team as well. We hope our experiences will help us
continue to deliver you interesting and useful information, but in all we hope
that you all enjoyed the coverage!


Results of the DPL elections
----------------------------



Neil McGovern has been elected
by the Debian Developers as the Debian Project Leader.




Lucas Nussbaum, in his last [bits
from the DPL](https://lists.debian.org/20150416144719.GA28835@xanadu.blop.info), said:
It has been a great honor to be the DPL for the
last two years. I would like to thank you all for having made it such as
fantastic experience. Debian is really a unique project to be part of. The
recent times have not been the easiest ever, but I am convinced that the
approaching jessie release will just show how we have overcame the recent
difficulties.




He also congratulated Neil for his election, and thanked Mehdi Dogguy and
Gergely Nagy for running.




More information about the result is available in the
[Debian Project Leader Elections 2015 page](https://www.debian.org/vote/2015/vote_001).
The new term for the project leader started on April 17 2015 and expires on
April 17 2016.



A delegation for the Outreach team
----------------------------------



We welcome the
[announcement](https://lists.debian.org/20150416113514.GB8087@xanadu.blop.info)
of an official delegation for the Outreach team.
The Outreach team is responsible for coordinating Debian's participation
in outreach programs such as Google Summer of Code and Outreachy
(formerly GNOME's Outreach Program for Women) -- but not limited to those two.




Initially, the team will be composed of Nicolas Dandrimont, Sylvestre Ledru,
Molly de Blanc, and Tom Marble. Details about their infrastructure, roles,
and how to reach them can be found at
<https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Outreach>.



Debian welcomes its 2015 Google Summer of Code Students
-------------------------------------------------------



Nicolas Dandrimont on behalf of the new Debian Outreach team welcomed the 17 students
selected to be part of the Google Summer of Code this year, two of them being
Outreachy applicants. They will work on quality assurance and developer tools,
porting and archive-wide enhancements, and packaging-related projects.
The complete list of students and projects can be found in the
[announcement email](https://lists.debian.org/20150501153407.GA20820@werner.olasd.eu).



Long Term Support announcements for Wheezy and Jessie, Report for Squeeze LTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Almost a year after the birth of the Debian Long Term Support (LTS) project,
with Squeeze LTS being considered a success, [it has been announced that
Debian 7 Wheezy and Debian 8 Jessie will benefit from Long Term
Support](https://www.debian.org/News/2015/20150424), along with a call for help from the Debian LTS team for
developer time and/or funding in order to improve and extend the archive
coverage for Wheezy LTS.




Freexian [published](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/04/14/freexians-report-about-debian-long-term-support-march-2015/) its report about Debian Long Term Support for March 2015, and some members of
the LTS team also reported about their work on the project: RaphaÃ«l Hertzog wrote
[an
overview about the LTS project and its contributions](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/04/15/looking-back-at-the-debian-long-term-support-project/), and Ben Hutchings published his
[LTS activities report
for April 2015](http://womble.decadent.org.uk/blog/debian-lts-work-april-2015.html).

about the progress made for debian-installer and related packages, such as: EFI
enhancements, OpenStack images, Debian-live images, and the new architectures.




Now that Jessie has been released, a new development cycle has begun, and with it, the work on
reproducible builds for Stretch, as [reported](https://people.debian.org/~lunar/blog/posts/reproducible_builds_stretch_week_1/) by Lunar.



Bucharest Debian Women mini-DebConf

development board to set up and use for the Debian arm64 port. The board is now

Please help us create this newsletter. We still need more volunteer writers to watch the Debian community and report about what is going on. Please see the [contributing page](https://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/HowToContribute) to find out how to help. We're looking forward to receiving your mail at [debian-publicity@lists.debian.org](mailto:debian-publicity@lists.debian.org).
