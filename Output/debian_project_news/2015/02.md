Reports
-------


Andreas Tille posted the [DebianMed Sprint report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-med/2015/02/msg00215.html), detailing the fifth sprint
collaboration between the DebianMed team, BioLinux, developers, and users. The
event was a great showcase for the Blends concept which also attracted new team
members. Several packages were uploaded and accepted immediately at the sprint,
thanks to the ftpmaster team, which meant work could continue on chains of
dependencies without interruption. More reports
and information about the work by M. Crusoe on screed, S. Steinbiss on barrnap,
Tim Booth on khmer, and other contributors is available on the [DebianMed 2015 Sprint Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/Sprints/2015/DebianMed2015).


Debian LTS work continues with RaphaÃ«l Hertzog working 14.5 hours on the
project. His highlights include a helper script to generate emails to package
maintainers. [Michael Banck](http://www.advogato.org/person/mbanck/diary.html?start=64) worked under sponsorship to keep [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/credativ/postgresql-lts/tree/REL8_4_LTS) updated for LTS, [Ben Hutchings](http://womble.decadent.org.uk/blog/debian-lts-work-february-2015.html) uploaded packages for cups and sudo, and Thorsten Alteholz
worked 14.5 hours uploading new versions of php5, krb5, and e2fsprogs.


RaphaÃ«l Hertzog
[is
reducing](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/03/06/my-free-software-activities-in-february-2015/) his non-work related involvement in Debian. This is
partially to change his focus and partially due to recognising he was being
distracted inside the project with mailing lists, RSS feeds, etc.
He has recently been working with a local political party and the handling of
their digital infrastructure, and specifically voting software.


[Thorsten
Alteholz](http://blog.alteholz.eu/2015/03/my-debian-activities-in-february-2015/) marked 154 packages for acceptance in his role as an FTP
Assistant. He also gives his opinions on some emails about interpretations of upstream
licenses.


A delegation for the Trademark Team
-----------------------------------


We welcome the [announcement](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/02/msg00011.html) of an official delegation for the Trademark team.
The team worked previously in an unofficial capacity as volunteers under the DPL
and were responsible for Debian trademark requests and for reporting violations.
Recently the team has completed the process of [registering Debian's swirl](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/02/msg00010.html) in
the U.S. They are now moving forward to international marks. Although the team
will still work closely with the Debian Project Leader and Software in the
Public Interest, the delegation means the team now functions on its own in its
responsibility for trademark use requests, new registrations, updates, and
extensions of Debian trademarks.


Calls for help: Debian Partners Program
---------------------------------------


Lucas Nussbaum put out a [call for help](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2015/02/msg00070.html) for the [Debian Partners](https://www.debian.org/partners/) program
which thanks and advertises organisations that support and help our project.
The present team has not been able to keep up with recent requests and
additions. Lucas is looking to build a small group in charge of the program
that would be responsible for setting up contribution levels, maintaining
records, and benchmarking the program.


Debian Project Leader Elections 2015
------------------------------------


The [call for nominations](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2015/03/msg00001.html) has started for the next Debian Project Leader election. The
DPL term starts on Friday 17 April 2015. Our [Constitution](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution#item-5) states the
elections should begin six weeks before the post becomes vacant. The process
allows interested developers to nominate themselves and announce their
[platforms](https://www.debian.org/vote/2015/platforms/) in the first week. This is followed with a three week period of the
nominees campaigning for the office, after which the last two weeks are reserved
for Debian Developers to cast their votes in the election. The process started
on 4 March 2015.


The nominees are: Mehdi Dogguy, Gergely Nagy, and Neil McGovern.


Events
------


The announcement has been made that registration is now open for [DebConf15](https://debconf15.debconf.org/),
taking place in Heidelberg, Germany, from Saturday, August 15, 2015 through
Sunday, August 22, 2015. Debconf15 will be preceded by one week of DebCamp,
Sunday, August 9, 2015 through Friday, August 14, 2015. If you would like to
attend DebConf15, please fill out the [registration form](https://summit.debconf.org/debconf15/registration/).


The DebConf Organisation team is happy to [announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/02/msg00009.html) that they can host
team sprints and take care of any logistics for working space, food, and
accommodation for said teams. Interested teams should contact them and plan on
having their sprints take place during DebCamp, 10 - 14 August. This is a
great opportunity for teams to attract other interested people, motivate
contributors, and reach the larger Debian community.


DebConf16 will take place in [Cape Town, South Africa](https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf16/Bids/Cape_Town).


Other news
----------


Stefano Zacchiroli [pointed out](https://identi.ca/zack/note/uf5PfjXhR1S5JciVOXeuZQ) that [Debian](http://www.imdb.com/company/co0504449/) now has an entry in the
Internet Movie Database, thanks to the movie Citizenfour. Debian is given
Special Thanks at the end of the film credits.


DPN asks: DSA, what do you do?
------------------------------



[Debian](https://www.debian.org/) is a large and global community of a lot of small actors, projects, and
teams. This month as part of a special feature we'd like to share with you
something about a project or a team that is working in Debian that you
may not be aware of.




 We reached out to the DSA team with the question: What do you do?




Paul Wise responds:



The [Debian System Administration (DSA) team](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DSA) is delegated to manage the
infrastructure of the Debian project, including machines, core services
and relationships with donors of equipment, services and hosting.


In practice, a nine person team gets to work through a deluge of email,
cron output, monitoring notifications, bouncing Debian member mail,
hoster/vendor notifications, spam, weird mail, misdirected questions,
hardware that fails to reboot, dying hardware, sick hardware, serial
consoles, disk replacements, hardware donations, hardware purchasing,
hardware sponsors, hosting sponsors, guest account requests, group
member changes, inter-release compatibility issues, service admin
prodding, security updates, inter-team co-ordination and much more.


Our tools of the trade include Debian stable (and some backports),
hardware capable of running amd64 VMs, entropy keys, ganeti, puppet,
icinga, munin, ikiwiki, git, postgresql, apache, openldap, gnupg,
openssh, bacula, ferm, sudo and a bunch of homegrown scripts.


We are interested in automation, reliability, speed, privacy, security,
resilience, longevity and try to balance these for the benefit of the
Debian project, members, users, derivatives and the wider world.


As we have a lot to deal with, we mostly leave the actual running of
services to service admins but provide [general guidance](https://wiki.debian.org/ServicesHosting#Recommended_practices_for_Debian_services) as well as
specific guidance on a case-by-case basis.


Our most recent achievement was [modifying the update-ca-certificates code](https://lists.debian.org/debian-services-admin/2014/12/msg00000.html) to
allow for multiple X.509 certificate stores and adding puppet bits to
ensure the 3 certificate stores we wanted are consistent between hosts.


An ongoing project is to [replace our current old LDAP web/mail frontend](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DSA/UserdirLdapRewrite)
with a new one based on Django.



If anyone would like to help out, please take a look at and
feel free to [fix the various bugs that we have filed](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?users=debian-admin@lists.debian.org).




For more information or to contact the team, visit their web page: [DSA Team](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DSA).



Interviews
----------


Zlatan TodoriÄ is conducting a series of interviews with FLOSS
developers, starting with [Joey Hess](https://zgrimshell.github.io/interviews-with-floss-developers-joey-hess/).
This interview touches on the life and lifestyle of
one of the prime movers in the Free Software Community. Joey speaks about
his life after Debian, programming, and living modestly.


Next in the series is an interview with [Paul Wise](https://zgrimshell.github.io/interviews-with-floss-developers-paul-wise/), a constant source of
information, member of DSA, and a member of our very own Publicity team. Paul
shares some of his history, his thoughts on FLOSS, and the future.

Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [Bugs Search interface of the Ultimate Debian Database](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi), the upcoming release, Debian Jessie, is currently affected by 112 Release-Critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about 67 Release-Critical bugs remain to be solved for the release to happen.


There are also [more detailed statistics](http://richardhartmann.de/blog/posts/2015/03/06-Debian_Release_Critical_Bug_report_for_Week_10/) as well as some [hints on how to interpret](https://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats) these numbers.
