Mourning Ian Murdock
--------------------



Debian is saddened to [share
the news](https://bits.debian.org/2015/12/mourning-ian-murdock.html) of the passing of Ian Murdock. Ian was not only the founder
of Debian, but friend and mentor to many. We will miss him dearly.




The publication of this issue of the Debian Project News has been delayed with this sad
news, along with the preparation of a dedicated announcement
that will be published soon on the debian-announce mailing list and
the website.
Thus what should have been the last DPN issue of 2015 has become the
first of 2016. In any case, we hope you find it useful.



The New Debian Project
News
---------------------------


This is our second newly revised issue of the DPN. We have shifted
some of the content around, introduced new sections, and moved some content
onto the [Bits from Debian](https://bits.debian.org/) blog.


Bits from Debian will showcase new packages and interviews, plus some announcements,
and is where we will welcome new DDs.


We are planning to send more short news items via our social network account.
Please be sure to follow us on [identi.ca/debian](https://identi.ca/debian)
(or fall back to the non-official mirrors in other social networks).


One of the major changes is the removal of the DSA security advisories from
the newsletter. Debian's Security Team releases current advisories on a daily
basis ([Security Advisories 2015](https://www.debian.org/security/2015/)), so
please read them carefully and take the proper measures.


If you need to be kept up to date about security advisories released by the
Debian Security Team, please
subscribe to the [security mailing
list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) (and the separate [backports
list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-backports-announce/), [stable updates
list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-stable-announce/), and [long term
support security updates list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/)) for announcements.



We are simplifying and (we hope) improving the help needed section.
From now on, you will find:


* links to packages needing help,
* links to bug reports tagged newcomer,
* calls for help from teams in coordination with the Welcome Team,
tailored for first-time contributors.


Internal News/Happenings
------------------------


**FAI 5.0 released**


After several months of hard work, the FAI team is very happy to
[announce](https://lists.uni-koeln.de/pipermail/linux-fai/2015-November/011147.html)
their new major release 5.0.


FAI (Fully Automatic Installation) is a non-interactive system to
install, customise, and manage Linux systems and software
configurations on computers as well as virtual machines and chroot
environments. FAI is a long-standing project in Debian and was started in
1999.


The new FAI ISO image now supports the installation of Debian 8 with
XFCE or GNOME desktop, Ubuntu 14.04, and CentOS 7.


Read the full feature list, download installation images (for CD/DVD or USB sticks),
or watch screenshots and videos on the
[FAI project website](https://fai-project.org/).


**Official Debian Images for Microsoft Azure**


The Microsoft Azure platform officially endorses and supports Debian,
by providing in their marketplace official Debian images, which are
 created in collaboration between several Debian teams (the Debian Cloud Team,
Debian Trademark Team, and Debian CD Team), credativ GmbH (Debian development partner), and Microsoft.



More info can be found in the
[blogpost by credativ](http://www.credativ.co.uk/credativ-blog/official-debian-images-microsoft-azure-are-now-available) and the [Debian Cloud Team
communication channels](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Cloud).


**Kernel oops collector is back in Debian!**


Debian's Kernel oops collector has returned to Debian thanks to the efforts of
[BÃ¡lint
RÃ©czey](http://balintreczey.hu/blog/kernel-oops-collector-is-back-in-debian/). The kerneloops collector available in [unstable](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/kerneloops) sends reports to
the [Linux Kernel Oops Service](http://oops.kernel.org/), which collects kernel errors from all over the
world helping kernel developers find and fix kernel issues that otherwise are
not reported.


**Mini DebConf at 2015 Latinoware Report**


Giovani Ferreira reported on a [Mini DebConf](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/br/2015/MiniDebconfLatinoware) that occurred on October 15 2015
during [Latinoware](http://latinoware.org/) in Brazil. Debian Developers Antonio Terceiro,
Felipe Augusto van de Wiel, JoÃ£o Eriberto Mota Filho, and Thadeu Lima de Souza Cascardo
were present and presented a number of talks on the Debian Project and ways to
contribute.


At the end of the programme new contributors and speakers spoke about how to
collaborate with Debian specifically in Brazil, and gave an everything you wanted
to know about Debian session. In addition to the presentation, the project had a
stand available at the exposition to receive stakeholders and distribute merchandise.


**Annual Deb Med Advent Calendar**


The [Debian Med
Advent Calendar](http://debian-med.alteholz.de/advent/) ran from December 1 through to 24. This
[annual event](https://lists.debian.org/debian-med/2015/12/msg00006.html)
aims at squashing bugs each day and marking them on their Advent Calendar. This
year they were able to close more than 50% of open bugs, 150 in total! Many
thanks to all who contributed.


**General Resolution: Update Standard Resolution Procedure**


The [Debian
Constitution](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution) had an
[amendment
dealing with our resolution procedures](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution#item-A) proposed and voted on. The
proposal of the amendment, seconds, and voting results were recently
[published](https://www.debian.org/vote/2015/vote_003).

Help needed
-----------


**DebConf16 needs your help to raise funds**



We are well into the organisation of [DebConf16](https://debconf16.debconf.org/),
which will take place in Cape Town, South Africa, in July of 2016.
The Debconf Fundraising Team [asks](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/10/msg00001.html)
every Debian contributor to consider acting as an advocate for Debian,
by asking your organisations to sponsor DebConf, particularly if your organisation
is either entirely new to sponsoring Debian, or has not sponsored Debian recently.
You can download a [brochure](http://media.debconf.org/dc16/fundraising/debconf16_sponsorship_brochure.pdf) and a
[flyer](http://media.debconf.org/dc16/fundraising/debconf16_sponsorship_flyer.pdf)
to help with the effort.
They summarise what Debian and DebConf are and list the available sponsorship benefits.


Although it would be great if the request came from someone known, if you would prefer not to ask directly, please contact
the [Fundraising Team](mailto:sponsors@debconf.org) with any leads.



**Debian will be at 2016 FOSDEM!**


Debian put forth a booth proposal which was accepted by [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/) and we will have
one table at the 2016 FOSDEM event. [A Call for Help](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/be/2016/FOSDEM) is needed for volunteers, organising,
mailing, booth presence, and other items. Help us put our best forward at this
amazing event!


**Packages needing help:**


[Currently](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/12/msg00375.html) [661 packages are orphaned](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/orphaned) and [171 packages are up for adoption](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/rfa): please visit the complete list of [packages which need your help](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/help_requested).


**Newcomer bugs**


Debian has a newcomer bug tag used to indicate bugs which are suitable for new
contributors to use as an entry point to working on specific packages.



There are [153](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=newcomer)
newcomer bugs available.

Reports
-------


**LTS status/updates**



Long Term Support for Squeeze reported 71.50 hours of paid support in [September](https://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/10/16/freexians-report-about-debian-long-term-support-september-2015/),
85.50 hours in [October](https://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/11/13/freexians-report-about-debian-long-term-support-october-2015/),
and 114.50 hours in [November](https://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/12/14/freexians-report-about-debian-long-term-support-november-2015/)
following an ascending curve. Now the project jumped from 50% to 65% of the
objective of the equivalent of a full-time position with a single new
sponsor said [RaphaÃ«l Hertzog](https://raphaelhertzog.com/tag/Freexian+LTS/)
in the monthly Freexian report about Debian Long Term Support,
greeting the first Platinum sponsor: TOSHIBA (through Toshiba Software Development
Vietnam). These work hours are regularly distributed between eight paid
contributors: Ben Hutchings, Chris Lamb, Guido GÃ¼nther, Mike Gabriel,
RaphaÃ«l Hertzog, Santiago Ruano Rincon, Scott Kitterman, and Thorsten
Altenholz. In terms of security, at the end of November, the dla-needed.txt
file listed 19 packages awaiting an update; the list of open vulnerabilities
in Squeeze shows about 22 affected packages in total, which is around the
average of the last months.



Guido GÃ¼nther reported on his contributed LTS work for [August](http://honk.sigxcpu.org/con/archive/2015/09/); he worked on
pykerberos, wordpress and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
triage for nine CVE items. In [September](http://honk.sigxcpu.org/con/archive/2015/10/) he worked on glibc and nss, with nine CVEs.
For the month of [October](http://honk.sigxcpu.org/con/archive/2015/11/) he worked on krb5 and the triaging of 16 CVEs. He also
added indentation support to LTS CVE/list Emacs on his own time, leading into
[December](http://honk.sigxcpu.org/con/Debian_Fun_in_November_2015.html) with work on krb5 and nss. After observing that nss requires frequent updates,
he added autopkg tests to the process and discussed using the same version in all suites.


Thorsten Alteholz reported on his [September](http://blog.alteholz.eu/2015/10/my-debian-activities-in-september-2015/) LTS contributions, work on a new
version of php5, a php5 update, openldap, and rpcbind. In [October](http://blog.alteholz.eu/2015/11/my-debian-activities-in-october-2015/) he worked on
updates for freeimage, polarssl, and libxml along with nine CVEs fixed. For [November](http://blog.alteholz.eu/2015/12/my-debian-activities-in-november-2015/)
he worked on php5, libpng, and libsndfile along with additional security
bugs.


The Debian 6 Squeeze long term support will continue until
February 2016. The LTS cycle of Debian 7 Wheezy is planned to run from
February 2016 to May 2018.

Outside News

**Software Freedom Conservancy Needs Donors!**


The Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) helps promote, improve, develop,
and defend Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects and provides a
non-profit home and infrastructure for FLOSS projects.


Last August, Debian and Conservancy announced a partnership and formed the
Copyright Aggregation Project where, among other things, Conservancy will
be able to hold copyrights for some Debian works and ensure compliance with
copyleft so that those works remain in free software.


Recently, Conservancy launched a [major
fundraising campaign](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/nov/23/2015fundraiser/) and needs more individual
supporters to gain more sustainable and independent funding. This will allow the
Conservancy to continue its efforts towards convincing more companies to comply
with free software licenses such as the GPL and take legal actions when dialogue
turns out to be unsuccessful. Conservancy needs your support now, more than ever!
