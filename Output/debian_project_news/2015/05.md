Reports
-------



The Ruby team posted a [report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2015/05/msg00001.html) on their recent meet at IRILL in Paris from
April 8 to 10 for the [2015 Debian Ruby Sprint](https://bits.debian.org/2015/05/ruby-sprint-2015.html).
Pre-Jessie a large part of the results were sent to experimental; post-release
the changes are being sent to unstable. The team triaged and/or fixed almost
all of the important bugs in Ruby library packages, and while doing so
discovered that the popular text-with-markup parsers bluecloth and redcloth
were unmaintained upstream; the team would like to encourage anyone to work on
these projects upstream.
Obsolete packages were identified and requests for removal filed and/or prepared.
The obsolete githubredir service has been removed, and a long-standing issue with
the handling of the /var/lib/gems/$VERSION paths resolved: for Stretch and beyond,
they will be shipped with the interpreter itself.
The team also worked on improving the support for Reproducible builds,
porting work for Ruby 2.2, whitelisting Ruby Packages in Debian CI, and packaging
improvements.


Niels Thykier updated the [status of experimental ddeb support](https://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg/2015/05/msg00038.html) which aims to
automatically produce debugging symbols for everything in the archive, without
developers needing to add -dbg packages. Currently a consensus has been reached
on using the .deb extension for ddebs for [Automatic Debug Packages](https://wiki.debian.org/AutomaticDebugPackages). Debhelper
has the necessary patches to produce compliant ddebs with the .deb extension.
Work is ongoing on support in dak, as well as progress in debhelper toward removing
and reverting patches. Niels kindly included an FAQ and outlined the most recent
changes. 


Martin Pitt has put forth an idea to enable stateless persistent network
interface names to overcome the problems with the kernel's unpredictable
sorting order of network devices. The proposal would remove the administrative
overhead of having to correct the order by using a round-about manner to keep
and use a stable interface name for firewalls or other network configuration.
His [initial proposal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/05/msg00170.html) called for dropping persistent-net-generator.rules and
enabling ifnames; however, as he received feedback and comments an
[updated proposal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/06/msg00018.html) was made which would include a naming policy using MAC based names
for USB and other devices.


From [Bits from the Debian Hamradio Maintainers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-hams/2015/05/msg00147.html), Ian Learmonth posted updates
on the Debian Hamradio pure blend and the status of its DVD images, work towards live
images based on Stretch, outstanding issue resolutions, and updates on packages
such as direwolf, qsstv, and soundmodem. 


Andrew Pollock [blogged](http://blog.andrew.net.au/2015/05/17#changelogs_back_2015) on fixing a few issues with changelogs.debian.net which
was giving incorrect codes, along with some needed cosmetic upgrades, and working
with api.ftp-master.debian.org. 


A challenge to improve reproducibility
--------------------------------------


GSOC student Eduard Sanou updated his status on [Reproducible builds in Debian](https://dhole.github.io/post/reproducible_builds_debian_gsoc2015/).
Many packages in Debian are built with a fair amount of unique data, such as
build machine names, unique IDs, and timestamps that may unfortunately
produce different results when they are built on different machines. The project goal
is to achieve the same binaries independently of what machine builds the
package for production. Eduard introduces himself with some of his background,
motivation, and separately the benefits of this coding work. 



While JÃ©rÃ©mie Bobbio continued his
[series](https://people.debian.org/~lunar/blog/posts/reproducible_builds_stretch_week_2/)
[of](https://people.debian.org/~lunar/blog/posts/reproducible_builds_stretch_week_3/)
[weekly](https://people.debian.org/~lunar/blog/posts/reproducible_builds_stretch_week_4/)
[reports](https://people.debian.org/~lunar/blog/posts/reproducible_builds_stretch_week_5/)
[about](https://people.debian.org/~lunar/blog/posts/reproducible_builds_stretch_week_6/)
[reproducibility](https://people.debian.org/~lunar/blog/posts/reproducible_builds_stretch_week_7/)
of package builds, and how it is improving over the Stretch development
cycle, Daniel Kahn Gillmor
[proposed
a challenge](http://debian-administration.org/users/dkg/weblog/115), called
one reproducible package a week.
Daniel invites everyone interested in Debian development to find packages on the
reproducible builds web pages which cannot be built reproducibly at
the moment and for which the reason has not been mentioned in the notes yet.
If you find the reason, you can then file a bug against the package with your
diagnosis, and tag it with one of the tags.
It is a good opportunity to discover many aspects of
Debian in a fun and useful way.
Daniel describes his workflow to achieve this, and also refers to the dedicated
[Wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds)
for more information.



Debian Squeeze LTS reports
--------------------------



Freexian sent a
[report](https://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/05/18/freexians-report-about-debian-long-term-support-april-2015/)
about the activities of contributors on the long term
support of Debian Squeeze during the month of April.
[Ben Hutchings](http://womble.decadent.org.uk/blog/debian-lts-work-may-2015.html),
[Thorsten Alteholz](http://blog.alteholz.eu/2015/06/my-debian-activities-in-may-2015/),
[RaphaÃ«l Hertzog](https://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/06/03/my-free-software-activities-in-may-2015/),
[Guido GÃ¼nter](http://honk.sigxcpu.org/con/Debian_work_in_May.html),
[Mike Gabriel](http://sunweavers.net/blog/node/15),
and
[Holger Levsen](http://layer-acht.org/thinking/blog/20150610-lts-may/)
have described on their blogs their work on Debian Squeeze LTS during
the month of May, together with their activities on Debian and more broadly on free software.



An official mirrors redirector
------------------------------



Raphael Geissert
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/05/msg00003.html)
the availability of an official Debian service, httpredir.debian.org,
acting as a Debian mirrors redirector. This service, known as
http.debian.net before it was hosted on Debian infrastructure,
allows many of the nearly 400 Debian mirrors to be available via a single address,
adapting to your network location, IP family
connectivity, and service availability, says Raphael.
To use this service with Debian Jessie, just put
deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian jessie main
in your /etc/apt/sources file.



A glimpse at DebConf15's program
--------------------------------



Monday June 15 is the
[deadline](http://lists.debconf.org/lurker/message/20150603.165921.a84cb7dd.en.html)
