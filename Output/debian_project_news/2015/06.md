Perl team sprint
----------------



The Debian Perl team had its first
[sprint](https://wiki.debian.org/Sprints/2015/DebianPerlSprint)
in May, and it was a success:
seven members met in Barcelona over the weekend from May 22 to
May 24 to kick off Perl development for Stretch and
to work on QA tasks across the more than 3000 packages that the
team maintains. Find all the details in the sprint
[report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-perl/2015/07/msg00009.html).



New documentation guides on the Debian website
----------------------------------------------



On his blog, Osamu Aoki [announced](http://goofying-with-debian.blogspot.ru/)
some updates to Debian documentation. Having created the
[debmake](https://packages.debian.org/sid/debmake) helper script to
produce Debian source packages, to take into account new packaging best practices,
he has rewritten the Debian Maintainers' Guide from scratch, available in the
[debmake-doc](https://packages.org/sid/debmake-doc) package.
Meanwhile, the [Debian
Handbook](https://debian-handbook.info/) is now also available from the
[Debian website](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-handbook/). This version
is built automatically from the
[corresponding
package](https://packages.debian.org/sid/debian-handbook) in Debian unstable. This is also the case for the documentation from
[debmake-doc](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debmake-doc/index.en.html) and more
generally for [other debian-doc related packages](https://www.debian.org/doc/).



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Neil McGovern, Debian project leader, sent a
[report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/07/msg00002.html)
about his recent activities: communication (in particular an
[interview](http://www.mylinuxrig.com/post/122864405658/the-linux-setup-neil-mcgovern-debian-project)
by Steven Ovadia, and an [open questions
session](http://redd.it/3ctb6n) on Reddit), funding management, and work with trusted organisations.



Help rescuing Debian Live Rescue
--------------------------------



Ben Armstrong
[sent](http://syn.theti.ca/2015/06/23/debian-live-rescue-needs-some-love/)
a second call for help to revive the rescue flavour of the Debian Live image,
which missed the Debian Jessie release, with a list of tasks to achieve.
If you are interested in helping with the Debian Live rescue image, contact
the #debian-live IRC channel on irc.debian.org, or send an email to
[Debian Live mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-live/).



Debian switches to FFmpeg for multimedia packages
-------------------------------------------------



For the Wheezy release, the Debian project moved from having [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) as the provider of multimedia libraries
to [Libav](https://libav.org/), which is also in use in the Jessie release.
The Debian Multimedia team
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/07/msg00001.html)
that after a [careful
review](https://wiki.debian.org/Debate/libav-provider/ffmpeg), they have decided to switch back to FFmpeg, and will do their best
to finish the transition for the next stable release, Debian Stretch.



Reproducible builds funded by the Linux Foundation
--------------------------------------------------



The
[Linux
Fundation's Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/)
[announced](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2015/06/linux-foundation-s-core-infrastructure-initiative-funds-three-new)
that
[they will support](https://bits.debian.org/2015/06/reproducible-builds-funded-by-cii.html)
two Debian Developers, Holger Levsen and
JÃ©rÃ©my Bobbio, with $200,000 to advance their Debian work on
[reproducible builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds)
and to collaborate more closely with other distributions such as
Fedora, Ubuntu, and OpenWrt to benefit from this effort.




In the meantime, JÃ©rÃ©my Bobbio
[published](https://people.debian.org/~lunar/blog/posts/reproducible_builds_stretch_week_7/)
[several](https://people.debian.org/~lunar/blog/posts/reproducible_builds_stretch_week_8/)
[issues](https://people.debian.org/~lunar/blog/posts/reproducible_builds_stretch_week_9/)
of his
[weekly](https://people.debian.org/~lunar/blog/posts/reproducible_builds_stretch_week_10/)
[report](https://people.debian.org/~lunar/blog/posts/reproducible_builds_stretch_week_11/)
from the Debian reproducible builds effort: since the last issue of
the Debian Project News, about 500 packages have become reproducible.



Transition to GCC5 and libstdc++6
---------------------------------



Matthias Klose sent a
[message](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/07/msg00000.html)
about the transition to GCC5 and libstdc++6, scheduled for the end of the month.
Bugs were filed for packages
[failing
to build from source](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=ftbfs-gcc-5;users=debian-gcc@lists.debian.org)
with the new GCC version, and for those where
[investigation
is needed](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=libstdc%2B%2B-cxx11;users=debian-gcc@lists.debian.org), to see if the transition to the new libstdc++ affects them.
Details of the transition can be found on the
[dedicated Debian wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/GCC5).



Report from Google Summer of Code students
------------------------------------------



Yuru Roy Shao, mentored by [Ritesh
Raj Sarraf](http://www.researchut.com/blog/gsoc-apport-for-debian), is working on Apport integration in Debian. Yuru posted
a [report](http://blog.yurushao.info/2015/07/Debian-Apport-GSoC/) on
the new features he implemented: uniqueness of the apport-notifyd notification
daemon instance, installation of debug symbols, use of the system APT cache to
avoid downloading packages twice, and Debian BTS integration.
Orestis Ioannou also sent an
[update](http://oioannou.com/2015/blog/gsoc-updates/)
on the work he has done on a new web application, the copyright tracker, as part of
the Debsources project.



Long Term Support reports
-------------------------



[Guido GÃ¼nther](http://honk.sigxcpu.org/con/Debian_work_in_June_2015.html),
[Thorsten Alteholz](http://blog.alteholz.eu/2015/07/my-debian-activities-in-june-2015/),
[Mike Gabriel](http://sunweavers.net/blog/node/16), and
[Ben
Hutchings](http://womble.decadent.org.uk/blog/debian-lts-work-june-2015.html) published their activities in Debian on their blogs, with a special
emphasis on their work on
[Squeeze Long Term Support](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS).



Tips and Tricks
---------------



Several members of the Debian community shared some tips:
Thomasz Buchert [explained](https://tomasz.buchert.pl/blog/2015/06/14/notmuch-response)
how to tag emails which haven't been replied to, using [notmuch](https://packages.debian.org/sid/notmuch).
Simon Josefsson
[explained](http://blog.josefsson.org/2015/06/16/ssh-host-certificates-with-yubikey-neo/)
how to deal with SSH Host Certificates with a YubiKey NEO.
Julien Danjou
[published](https://julien.danjou.info/blog/2015/python-and-timezones)
on his blog an article on the need to always consider timezone
information with any timestamp, and how to do that in Python.
Sandro Tosi [explained](http://sandrotosi.blogspot.com.au/2015/06/cfengine-upgrade-debian-packages.html)
how to tweak the configuration of [CFEngine](https://packages.debian.org/sid/cfengine3) for package upgrades, to deal with
[epochs](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version) in Debian versions.
Michael Prokop
[noticed](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2015/07/02/haproxy-with-debiansqueeze-clients-causing-random-hash-sum-mismatch/)
on his blog that HAProxy causes random Hash Sum mismatch errors with
Debian Squeeze clients. A solution to this issue was proposed in a comment by Petter
Reinholdtsen.



Other news
----------


The 39th issue of the
[miscellaneous news for developers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/06/msg00002.html)
has been released and covers the following topics:


* Android Tools Team
* Google Code closing
* uscan redirector pypi.debian.net
* Derivatives census update
* oldoldstable on DDPO


Martin Michlmayr
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/20150615204618.GA23765@jirafa.cyrius.com)
that support for the D-Link DNS-323 and Conceptronic CH3SNAS has been
removed in Debian Stretch, because the kernel is now too large to fit into
the flash on these devices.



The [technical committee](https://www.debian.org/devel/tech-ctte)
published
[their
decision](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/06/msg00004.html) about the maintainership of the
[aptitude package](https://packages.debian.org/sid/aptitude).




Niels Thykier sent an
[update](https://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg/2015/06/msg00018.html)
on the status of
[automatically generated
debug packages](https://wiki.debian.org/AutomaticDebugPackages), with a summary of the missing pieces, hints on how people can help to
improve the situation, and some answers to frequently asked questions.



He also [introduced
in his blog](https://nthykier.wordpress.com/2015/06/22/introducing-dak-auto-decruft/) a new tool he created with the FTP masters for dak,
the Debian Archive Kit. The purpose of the auto-decrufter is to
identify common types of cruft (such as binary packages no longer
built from any source package), and automatically remove them from
unstable when nothing Depends or Build-Depends on them. Until recently that
removal has been 100% manual and done by the FTP masters.


Pirate Praveen Arimbrathodiyil successfully managed to get a
crowd-funding campaign to work
full time for a month on the Debian packaging for the
[Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/) social network.
He [sent](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/07/msg00277.html)
a report explaining the different tasks he carried out, including packaging 23
dependencies and updating 34 existing packages.
