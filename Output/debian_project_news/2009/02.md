Release update
--------------


Adeodato SimÃ³, on behalf of the release team, sent a
[release
update](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/02/msg00000.html) about the upcoming release of Debian GNU/Linux 5.0
Lenny, which might be released during the weekend of 14 February
2009.


With the recent
[second
release candidate](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/12/msg00006.html) of the debian-installer for Lenny, the archive has
now gone into deep freeze, which means that only packages fixing
release critical bugs will be allowed to enter Lenny. People wanting to help
can fix these bugs, test the debian-installer, or help with the
[release
notes](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc/2008/11/msg00034.html).


Finally he mentioned that a Lenny-and-a-half release is also
planned, which will add drivers needed for newer hardware.


Debian Summer of Code '08: where are they now?
----------------------------------------------


Obey Arthur Liu gave a retrospective
about this year's [Google
Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/) projects,
where students were paid by Google to work on various programming tasks
for free software projects. (See [Part
1](http://www.milliways.fr/2009/01/20/debian-2008-where-now-1/), [Part
2](http://www.milliways.fr/2009/01/28/debian-2008-where-now-2/), [Part
2.5](http://www.milliways.fr/2009/02/01/debian-2008-where-now-2-5/) and [Part
3](http://www.milliways.fr/2009/02/02/debian-2008-where-now-3/).)


Debian had [twelve
projects](https://www.debian.org/News/2008/20080427) granted, one of which was unfortunately abandoned for
personal reasons. The other eleven projects all succeeded to some extent:
some of them are already in use, while others need more development time
before they can be fully used.


At [FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org/2009/), Arthur [gave
some suggestions](http://www.milliways.fr/2009/02/08/fosdem09-gsoc08-slides/) on how to perform better in the 2009 Summer of Code
and volunteered to help implement them.


Dedicating Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 Lenny to Thiemo
ths Seufer
----------------------------------------------------------


As already announced, the Debian Project has decided to dedicate its upcoming
release of Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 Lenny to Thiemo Seufer, who died on
December 26th, 2008 in a tragic car accident.


To this end, Christoph Berg [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/02/msg00001.html)
for GPG signatures of [a particular text file](https://people.debian.org/~myon/dedication-5.0.txt), which will be placed on our mirrors
in the directory docs/dedication along with all the signatures.
Every Debian developer, maintainer, translator, or contributor
in any other field is welcome to join us in signing this dedication.


Open Source study conducted by Heise Open
-----------------------------------------


The German open source portal [Heise Open](http://www.heise.de/open/) conducted a survey on the
use of open source software in German businesses. 1,312 companies
participated: 30% were from companies with less than ten employees, 51%
were small and medium-sized business and 19% had more than 500
employees.


Debian was ranked as the leading server distribution used by 47% of
all companies and as the second most used distribution on the desktop
with 29.9% (for companies with more than 500 employees the adoption rate
was higher, at about 37%). The full survey (German language only) can be
found [here](http://www.heise.de/open/Trendstudie-Open-Source--/artikel/126682).


Bits from the DPL
-----------------


Steve McIntyre published [bits from the DPL](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/01/msg00005.html). While
some of the points in his report have already been covered in the [previous edition of the Debian Project News](https://www.debian.org/News/project/2009/01)
(such as the outcome of the recent votes, and plans for Lenny), others have not,
such as the appointment of two additional members to the Debian System Administrators group: Luca Filipozzi
and Stephen Gran. He thanked James Troup for his long service in this
team.


He also brought up the need for discussions in the community after
Lenny has been released over issues such as constitutional clarifications
and organizational changes. To help track these topics, Miriam Ruiz has
created a [wiki
page](https://wiki.debian.org/DiscussionsAfterLenny).


Finally he mentioned the declassification of the archive of the
debian-private list, which is used for internal discussion. Three years
ago [it was decided](https://www.debian.org/vote/2005/vote_002)
to declassify (at least some of) the contents of the debian-private
mailing list, so volunteers are now needed to work on this.


Google portable devices running Debian
--------------------------------------


Several people have been working on a way to install Debian GNU/Linux
on their T-Mobile G1 Android phones (See for example [here](http://technologyheaven.blogspot.com/2009/01/google-portable-devices-runs-debian.html),
[here](http://www.saurik.com/id/10) or [here](http://www.androidfanatic.com/cms/community-forums.html?func=view&catid=9&id=251#251)).
They have succeeded in running a full fledged Debian OS on their G1
Android cellphones, while retaining all the features which allow it to
function as a cellphone such as receiving and making calls. This is
achieved by creating a chroot environment which can invoked from a shell,
thus making the whole range of Debian applications available to be run on
that device.


Joey Hess, long term developer of the Debian installation system, [analysed](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/investigation_of_an_inelegant_installer/)
their installation system and came to the conclusion that — while working
— it's not as technically elegant as he would wish it to be, since it
mainly extracts an archive containing the chroot environment instead of
calling debootstrap, which would be the correct way to set up a chroot.
More generally speaking, he sees it as a pity that when people want to
get Debian on a new device only about half of them seem to do it right,
by modifying d-i and sending the modifications back to the installer
team.


Best practice in team maintenance of packages
---------------------------------------------


Gregor Herrmann [summarized](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2009/02/msg00006.html)
the results of a Birds of a Feather session during the last Debian
Conference about best practice in team maintenance of packages. Topics
included bringing members of different packaging teams together; getting
an overview of different work flows, tools, and challenges; compiling
generally useful 'models of good practice'; and defining possible areas
for cooperation/tasks of mutual interest. A
[wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Resources) has been set
up for the purpose of collecting tools relevant for packaging teams.


DDPortfolio service available
-----------------------------


Jan Dittberner [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2009/01/msg00474.html)
his [DDPortfolio](http://debianstuff.dittberner.info/ddportfolioservice/)
service. This service can create a page of useful links collecting
together the other web based information services for a given Debian
Maintainer or Developer.


Bits from the Policy Team, call for volunteers
----------------------------------------------


Debian's policy team [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/01/msg00006.html)
that version 3.8.1 of Debian's packaging Policy is in preparation and
will be released very shortly after Lenny has been released. It includes
12 bug fixes and 7 normative changes (affecting the requirements set by
Policy rather than the wording, presentation, or supporting
documentation).


However, there is a general need for more people working on Policy,
including simply participating in discussions on the mailing lists and
evaluating proposals. There's also a need for experienced Debian
developers who have the time and background required to be full Policy
delegates as well as helping to convert Debian Policy from
DebianDoc-SGML to DocBook and formalizing a new structure that would
make it easier to extract bits of information from Policy requirements.


List statistics for Debian mailing lists
----------------------------------------


Andreas Tille [created
some](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2009/01/msg00161.html) statistics about Debian's mailing lists, their usage and their
contributors. He tried to detect healthy projects as well as projects
in need of help, such as Debian's OpenOffice.org maintainers, who have
been looking for help for quite some time.


Debian Project at SCaLE 2009
----------------------------


From Friday 20th February 2009 to Sunday 22nd February 2009, the
Debian Project will participate with a booth at the Seventh Annual
Southern California Linux Expo in Los Angeles, USA. For further details,
see the relevant [events
page](https://www.debian.org/events/2009/0221-scale7x).


Gareth J. Greenaway [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-na/2009/02/msg00000.html) that
Debian developers and users will get a 50% discount off the price of a
full access pass to the show when using a special promotion code.


Other news
----------


The thirteenth issue of the [miscellaneous
news for developers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/01/msg00007.html) has been released and covers the following
topics:


* Security support for new testing (Squeeze) delayed
* New whohas tool displays other distributions that have your package
* Documentation for python-apt
* sbuild and wanna-build status update
* Kernel pseudo-package removed


JÃ¶rg Jaspert [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/01/msg00004.html)
the addition of Mike O'Connor to the archive team. He also added that
this team is in need of fresh blood and mentioned some criteria that
interested people should fulfil.


Bdale Garbee, a former DPL and current Project secretary and Technical Committee chairman,
[gave a detailed
and very interesting interview](http://www.itwire.com/content/view/22859/1090/) for IT Wire,
talking about things those outside the Debian Project are not usually
aware of.


Enrico Zini, a Debian Developer, [gave
an interview to FSFE](http://www.fsfe.org/en/fellows/ciaran/fellowship_interviews/fellowship_interview_with_enrico_zini), talking about Debian, women in FLOSS and
Debian, FLOSS at schools, and social groups, among other subjects.


[Lars
Steinke](http://times.debian.net/?category=interviews#1297) and [Jeremy
Malcolm](http://times.debian.net/?category=interviews#1300) each described how they became Debian Developers, their
present involvement, how they are using Debian, and their interests
outside the Debian Project.


J. A. Watson was [pleasantly surprised](http://www.linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/2009012302335OSHW)
by his experience installing Debian on Alpha machines. The obvious choice was Debian, as it is
well known as a good server distribution, and they still have Alpha distributions and installation
instructions. [..] Less than an hour, and it was up and
running like a charm.


A long time outstanding serious [bug](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=211765)
concerning the licensing of several GLX related files shipped with the
package xorg-server has finally been closed by Bdale Garbee now that the
affected material has been re-licensed under a license considered free
according to the [Debian Free
Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines), the SGI Free Software License B, version
2.0.


JÃ¶rg Jaspert [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/01/msg00008.html)
the creation of a new archive signing key. The key will not be used yet,
but was created to be shipped with Lenny and put in use either with the
first point release for Lenny or on the first of July, when the old key
expires.


The [DebConf](https://debconf.org/) organizer team will soon decide where the eleventh annual Debian Conference will
take place. Current [candidates](http://lists.debconf.org/lurker/message/20090125.230146.efec4bcb.en.html)
are Venezuela, Quito in Ecuador, and New York City or Boston in the
USA.


Daniel Burrows [continued](http://algebraicthunk.net/~dburrows/blog/entry/a-better-map-of-the-apt-state-files/)
creating diagrams explaining the work of APT, aptitude and similar tools.
He has now created a diagram for the different status files used by
APT.


Ana Beatriz Guerrero Lopez [gave
a report](http://ekaia.org/blog/2009/01/25/end-of-backports-and-about-kde-in-lenny/) about the current state of KDE backports and plans for the
future.


New Maintainers
---------------


Michael Hanke and Jan Hauke Rahm were [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2009/01/msg00130.html)
as Debian Maintainers.
