Debian Weekly News - March 13th, 2002
=====================================


Welcome to this year's eleventh issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. It looks like this was a quiet week. However, it was a great
week, since the Woody release process continues well and a Debian Developer
apparently won two Gold medals.


**Woody Release Status.** Anthony Towns sent in another [report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0203/msg00009.html)
covering the Woody release. The [bug count](https://bugs.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/) is still going
down, but more slowly than we might like. Please keep looking through
packages you maintain or use to make sure they are releasable. Again, he
removed a bunch of packages from Woody that seemed to be unreleasable.


**Project Leader Elections Debate.** Randolph Chung sent a [Call
for Questions](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0203/msg00008.html) for the upcoming Debian Project Leader (DPL) Election
debate, as [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0203/msg00004.html) by the project secretary last week. As currently envisioned,
the debate will be moderated by the [panelists](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0203/msg00005.html), and will be broken down into four parts: General questions,
questions directed to the candidates, questions that arise during the above
two parts and, finally, closing remarks and rebuttal.


**XFS based Boot Floppies.** Two people are working towards
integration of XFS into Debian's boot-floppies. Eduard Bloch created the
first installations CD image for Woody and XFS which can be downloaded from [here](https://people.debian.org/~blade/XFS-Install/). Angelo Ovidi
started a new project on SourceForge called [XFDeb](http://xfdeb.sourceforge.net/). He already created a rescue
disk based on kernel 2.4.14 and XFS 1.0.2 and is going to create the root and
drivers floppies, too. His aim is to unify his work with Ionut Georgescu's [Debian
installer with SGI XFS support](http://www.physik.tu-cottbus.de/~george/woody_xfs/) to offer the XFS journaling file system as
an option at installation time.


**Debian Developer wins Paralympic Gold twice.** It seems that
one of our developers, [Bart
Bunting](http://www.paralympics2002.com/athletes/biographies/41002.html), is attending the Paralympics currently being held in Salt Lake
City. He [won](http://www.abc.net.au/news/sport/othersport/2002/03/item20020311102704_1.htm) the gold medal in the visually impaired mens Super-G and Downhill.
Bart, a two-time world champion at the titles in Switzerland two years ago, is
competing at his first Paralympics. Congratulations Bart!


**teTeX Documentation Licenses.** C.M. Connelly is in the [process](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0203/msg00054.html) of
vetting the documentation files that are distributed with the tetex packages.
Most of them are compliant with the [Debian Free Software
Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) (DFSG), partially using the [LaTeX Project Public License](http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt)
(LPPL), [GNU General Public
License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) (GPL), their own DFSG-compliant license, or in the public
domain. There are about 30 documents whose licensing status is less clear, and
those are the ones that are the subject of investigation.


**DebianHelp Needs A New Home.** The web site [DebianHelp](http://www.debianhelp.org/) was created in 2000 and
aims to help out beginners to Debian GNU/Linux. Presently, the maintainer
of DebianHelp himself, Randy Edwards, is asking for help, because the
site will lose its internet connection in a couple of months. People who want
to offer him hosting for the web site or the server should drop [Randy](mailto:redwards@golgotha.net) a line.
