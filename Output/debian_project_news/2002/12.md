Debian Weekly News - March 20th, 2002
=====================================


Welcome to this year's twelfth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. 


**Voting starts on Sunday.** Manoj Srivastava, the
Project Secretary, posted an [update](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2002/debian-devel-announce-200203/msg00013.html)
to the election process. The voting starts on Sunday March 24th 00:00
UTC. At 21:00 UTC, Saturday 23th March, there will be an IRC debate
in #debian-debate on OpenProjects IRC Network. 


**Boot floppies 3.0.21 released.** Adam Di Carlo [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2002/debian-boot-200203/msg01007.html)
for more non-i386 testing of the installation system. This release is
the first one which builds against Woody instead of sid. Like most
releases of boot-floppies, it has an impressive list of changes.
Please help test those so we can get Woody out the door soon. 


**Pre-release XFree 4.1.0-15 .debs.** Branden Robinson
has pre-release .debs available at his [repository](https://people.debian.org/~branden/woody/). As he
[writes:](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2002/debian-devel-200203/msg00531.html)
`<crass bribe>The sooner I can put this release to bed, the
sooner I can work on 4.2.0.</crass bribe>`. So, please
help test those packages and report bugs to the [debian-x mailing list](mailto:debian-x@lists.debian.org).



**Censoring Debian?** irssi-scripts got a [bug report](https://bugs.debian.org/138092) about a racist
joke which was used as a kick message. This spawned a long, long [thread](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2002/debian-devel-200203/msg00829.html)
about censorship with both tongue-in-cheek and serious comments. We
won't even *try* to summarize the thread here. However, it
spawned some interesting threads about censorship, whether perl is
offensive and whether Debian Jr. should conflict with offensive
packages.


**CeBIT Trip Report.** Even though the Debian project
wasn't able to acquire a booth at this year's CeBIT exhibition, which
is the largest computer show in Europe, there have been some
interesting activities with regard to Free Software and GNU/Linux.
Several Free Software advocates attended this event. We found out that
the only CDs containing GNU/Linux that were handed out to visitors
contained a derivative of the Debian system: [Knoppix](http://www.knoppix.de/), which was distributed by
the [Agency for IT Security](http://www.bsi.bund.de/) of
the Federal Ministry of the Interior of Germany, and a specialized
system that we are going to report about in our next issue. It seems
that the hype is over and GNU/Linux is becoming an accepted operating
system among others.


**update\_output.txt explained.** The scripts which
install packages into testing generate two files which are useful to
understand why a package isn't moved into testing. Those are [update\_output.txt](https://release.debian.org/britney/update_output.txt)
and [update\_excuses.html](https://release.debian.org/britney/update_excuses.html).
Those are somewhat explained at Jules Bean's [Unofficial
Testing FAQ](https://people.debian.org/~jules/testingfaq.html). In addition, Anthony Towns [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2002/debian-devel-200203/msg00901.html)
it some more. 


**Linda announced and pre-released.**
Steve Kowalik wrote a replacement for lintian, [Linda](https://people.debian.org/~stevenk/linda/), which is in
python instead of perl. She was [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2002/debian-devel-200203/msg01097.html)
and pre-released this week. Linda follows in lintian's footsteps by
being modular and extensible, although she checks packages a lot
faster than lintian. Steve tells us that he hopes Linda will be
uploaded to the archive when the crypto-in-main confusion dies
down.


**Debian GNU/Linux User is Poor Hacker?** Several
months ago, Franck Alcidi made some interesting drawings, which show the
respective GNU/Linux users' image: Debian Geek, Red Hat Geek, SuSE
Geek, Mandrake Geek and so on, as shown in the [72nd issue](http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue72/alcidi.html) of Linux Gazette. He described the Debian Geek as a poor and real
hacker.


**How to split packages?** Junichi Uekawa [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2002/debian-devel-200203/msg01399.html)
how to split packages. Colin Watson gave some [advice](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2002/debian-devel-200203/msg01414.html)
on it, and how he handled the split of groff into groff and
groff-base.


**Securing Debian Manual 2.0 released.** Javier
FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino PeÃ±a informed us that he had updated the [Securing
Debian Manual](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/). The translations are not up-to-date yet. [Javier](mailto:jfs@computer.org) is looking for people to fix
the FIXMEs and translate the manual.


**New or Noteworthy Packages.** The following packages
were added to the Debian archive recently.


 Because of the ongoing crypto-in-main transition, dinstall seems
to have been stopped, so we are postponing this week's New Packages
List to the next issue.



**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.


* No security advisories this week!


**Got News?** Please inform us about everything that is
happening in the Debian community. We are always looking for any interesting
stories to add, especially new items by volunteer writers, and topics we tend
to miss. We're looking forward to receiving your mail at [dwn@debian.org](mailto:dwn@debian.org).
