Debian Weekly News - April 24th, 2002
=====================================


Welcome to this year's seventeenth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for
the Debian community. Since the Debian project joined (is planning to join) [OASIS](http://www.oasis-open.org/) (Organization for the Advancement
of Structured Information Standards) we will keep an eye on them. One thing
that was reported last week covered IBM's [patent
reservation](http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/ebxml-cppa/200203/msg00155.html) which would render ebXML (an open standard for electronic
transactions and business collaboration) useless. However, later IBM [clarified](http://lists.ebxml.org/archives/ebxml/200204/msg00004.html)
the issue.


**Debian GNU/FreeBSD Base Tarball.** Nathan Hawkins recently
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0204/msg00021.html)
a new base tarball for those of you who would like to see Debian GNU/FreeBSD
live. A whole bunch of packages had to be [modified](https://people.debian.org/~utsl/freebsd-i386/patched/) for
this purpose, but the work seems to be worth it. People should also check the
[status](https://people.debian.org/~utsl/freebsd-i386/status.html)
of this port.


**Say Thanks.** As a reaction to the most recent [flamebait](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg01289.html)
Sean Perry [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg01316.html), that we should say thanks to the people who make our day easier.
He says, that just mailing out a big "thank you, your work is used every day
and I love it" is worth more than anything.


**Why XFree86 4.2 Isn't in Woody.** As another reaction to the
most recent [flamebait](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg01289.html) on missing XFree86 4.2 packages Branden Robinson sent an [article](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg01343.html) to
the list. He explains that he has been busy with getting 4.1.x stable, which
has to run on no less than 11 architectures. [XFree86](http://www.xfree86.org/) doesn't test or prepare
distribution tarballs for several of these architectures. Hence, Debian is
the de facto portability laboratory for XFree86 on Linux.


**Hurd Ceased?** Some people may have noticed that all
packages from the hurd-i386 architecture have been removed recently. Don't
worry too much, since Jeff Bailey [requested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd-0204/msg00096.html)
this, so the Hurd team can start uploading packages with the new [ABI](https://foldoc.org/ABI) (Application
Binary Interface), the interface by which an application program gains access
to operating system and other services. It's probably best to wipe out your
existing Hurd system and re-install it. No effort has been made to make this
an easy transition.


**Activating Keys on Extended Keyboards.** It's a frequently
asked question from laptop owners: How is one supposed to make use of
additional keys? If the Linux kernel and XFree86 generate key codes for them,
[hotkeys](https://lists.debian.org/debian-laptop-0204/msg00369.html)
or just plain [xmodmap](https://lists.debian.org/debian-laptop-0204/msg00376.html)
may be helpful. If Linux doesn't know about the keys, you'll have to go [patching](http://fake.by-infonet.de/laptop/) the kernel first.


**Potato's Fate?** Several users [wondered](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://debianplanet.org/article.php?sid=646) what will
happen to Debian 2.2 alias Potato when Woody has been released. Those who
have slow or small machines that run Potato just fine, may be reluctant to
upgrade to Woody, since Woody requires more space and more powerful machines
than Potato. One thing is certain, once Woody is released, the Potato release
will be moved to the [archive](ftp://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/dists/) where other
old releases like buzz, rex, bo, hamm and slink are saved. The security team
might support the old stable release for a while after Woody has been
released, but it would be better not to depend on that, revealed Josip Rodin.
