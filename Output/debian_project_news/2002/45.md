Debian Weekly News - November 19th, 2002
========================================


Welcome to this year's 45th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. If you don't know yet what to give for Christmas,
check out this [Debian art
collection](https://lists.debian.org/debian-commercial-02/msg00002.html). There's more good news, since Drew Scott Daniels [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0211/msg00160.html)
that the LZW patent runs out in the U.S. on December 20th, 2002. LZW is used
as compression method in several data formats, such as TIFF.


**Draft W3C Patent Policy.** Attorney Larry Rosen [reports](http://www.newsforge.com/newsforge/02/11/14/2012210.shtml?tid=17)
that the [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3c.org/) (W3C)
needs feedback on their [last-call
draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-patent-policy-20021114/) of a new patent policy. The good news is that this latest draft
calls for all W3C specifications to be freely implementable. Larry says "The
community now needs to be heard supporting this policy so that it is not
undone during the public input and W3C Advisory Council phase." Comments are
being accepted until December 31st, 2002, at [www-patentpolicy-comment@w3.org](mailto:www-patentpolicy-comment@w3.org).


**Packages Removed by Release Manager.** In accordance with
the [announcement](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0210/msg00019.html) last month, Anthony Towns [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0211/msg00006.html), that about thirty packages that were removed from the distribution.
However, at least three more packages were removed from the [non-US](http://satie.debian.org/~troup/removals.txt) distribution as
well. Anthony states that these packages may be reuploaded and will be
considered new packages with the usual processing. Please make sure that any
known bugs are actually fixed before you do so, though.


**Prerelease of OpenOffice.org available.** Chris Halls [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-openoffice-0211/msg00048.html)
a new set of prerelease packages for the OpenOffice.org (OOo) application
suite. If no problems are found these packages are supposed to be uploaded to
unstable soon. Additionally, [upstream](http://www.openoffice.org/) asked for help with a new [initiative](http://www.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=458885&listName=announce) to make OOo a well behaved citizen on ones harddisk by using
the systems native installer to become the default way to install, modify, or
uninstall it. Naturally, Debian packages are already listed as being
supported by the next release.


**Voting Amendments.** The current [constitution](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution) has some ambiguities and
different people have different ideas about what the constitution says should
be done if Debian ever has a ballot where some of the choices require amending
the constitution and others don't. Also, some of these [interpretations](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0210/msg00024.html)
could give disappointing results for elections with big ballots with popular
choices. Several people are [working](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0211/msg00020.html) on a
[revised
voting procedure](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0211/msg00061.html) which doesn't have these ambiguities, and which
disregards as few votes as possible even for elections with big ballots and
lots of popular choices.


**Update on Statistics about Debian on the Desktop.** An [ongoing
survey](http://www.desktoplinux.com/cgi-bin/survey/survey.cgi?view=results&id=10292001114910) on Desktoplinux.com asks which GNU/Linux distribution users prefer
for desktop computing. [Last month](http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS3606633376.html),
Debian was placed fourth at 8.9 %. This time, with 14.1 % of the vote,
Debian has stormed ahead of Red Hat and SuSE to be second only to Mandrake.
Around 1300 more votes were registered since October, totally over 6200
responses.


**Alignment with the Linux Standard Base.** Steve Greenland [raised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg01276.html) some
concerns over how run-parts from the [debianutils](https://packages.debian.org/stable/base/debianutils)
package should handle file names. Run-parts is used to execute a number of
scripts or programs found in one directory (for example, scripts in
`/etc/cron.daily`). The "run-parts" program requires
these script filenames to consist entirely of letters, digits,
underscores or hyphens. Any filenames containing a period are ignored, so
scripts like "script.dpkg-new" are passed over. A bug was filed suggesting
that the period be allowed in filenames, for example "script.sh" and it was
pointed out that the [Linux Standard
Base](http://www.linuxbase.org/) requires the period to be allowed. Rather than make sudden changes
to run-parts, Steve thought it would be a good idea to find a standard way for
all programs of this nature to behave within Debian.


**MAME to become licensed under the GPL?** It was [reported](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/11/13/220204) that
the developers of the Multi Arcade Machine Emulator (MAME) have indicated that
they [consider](http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html)
releasing future versions under the GNU [General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) (GPL).
MAME's [current license](http://www.mame.net/readme.html) contains
certain restrictions that render it non-free according to the [Debian Free Software
Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines). MAME adopting the GPL would be a positive addition to Free
Software, although most of the game ROMs that MAME uses remain very
non-free.


**Help with Signed Packages.** Javier FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino PeÃ±a
[asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg00714.html)
for help with integrating signature checks in the Debian user infrastructure.
Ian Jackson raised additional [concerns](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg01118.html)
about tainted systems and having the need for a Certification Authority.
However, Javier still depends on per-package signatures and Anthony Towns [explains](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg00738.html)
with details why this is not the way for Debian to go, again.


**Getting rid of undocumented Manpages.** Manoj Srivastava [reports](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg00819.html)
that there is a proposal under consideration for changing the undocumented(7)
manpage. The proposal states more explicitly that the lack of a manpage is a
bug and should be reported to the Bug Tracking System.


**URLs in the Package Description.** David Goodenough (as an
example for others) [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg00839.html) whether
upstream URLs could be added to the package description on our [packages pages](https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages). RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg00864.html) that
it's already documented in the best packaging practice to add an upstream URL
to the description. Joey Hess, however, [complained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg01260.html)
that the Description field is not intended to be a random dumping-ground for
any information that cannot fit into some other field. Branden Robinson
finally [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg00926.html) that the [policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-docs.html#s-copyrightfile)
already mandates upstream URLs, but in the copyright file.


**Phoenix Prerelease Packages.** Eric Dorland [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg01090.html)
prerelease packages for the [Phoenix](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/) web-browser, which
is a redesign of the Mozilla browser component, similar to [Galeon](http://galeon.sourceforge.net/). There are no source
packages yet, because Eric hasn't come up with a good way to package the
source, and he doesn't want to package unnecessary components, since it's
really rather large.


**Debian Accessibility Project.** Mario Lang [summarized](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg01291.html)
the current state of issues regarding accessibility in Debian, and also tried
to give a bit of [overview](https://people.debian.org/~mlang/DebianAccessibilityProject.html) of tasks which are necessary to ensure that Debian is accessible
to people with disabilities. It includes references to software that is
already part of Debian, and tries to summarize the situation as well as
provide a list of tasks for people interested in helping.


**Knoppix-Med.** By virtue of the large success of [Knoppix](http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html) people from
the [Debian-Med](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-med/) subproject [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-med-0211/msg00012.html) a
Knoppix-Med effort to include several pieces of medical software in it.
The [document](http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/*checkout*/gnumed/gnumed/gnumed/test-area/knoppix/readme.html) that describes how to remaster Knoppix to include GNUmed and
other medical software, is finally online.
