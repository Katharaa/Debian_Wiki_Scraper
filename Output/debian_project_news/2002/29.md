Debian Weekly News - July 30th, 2002
====================================


Welcome to this year's 29th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. If you ever wanted to know how you could fund Free Software
development, see what Drew Scott Daniels [sent](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2002/29/mail#mail1) us. You may also find a good job in the UK, that recently released a
[policy](http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/news/newonsite/oss-policy.htm)
for using Free Software within the UK government.


**New Jigdo Howto.** This week we found out that Peter Jay
Salzman wrote a [Debian
Jigdo mini-Howto](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/Debian-Jigdo/) which was added to the Linux Documentation Project
recently. Getting Debian ISOs has always been a painful, slow and supremely
inefficient process. Jigdo is a new tool for obtaining Debian iso images in
an easy, fast and very efficient manner. This HOWTO describes why you should
use jigdo, adds a small explanation how it works and how it is used to get and
update Debian iso images.


**Policy for Woody Point-Releases.** [Several](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg01411.html) [developers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg01416.html)
[would](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg01614.html) [like](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg01483.html) to add
new packages and updates to their packages to the recently released stable
distribution of Debian. Adding new packages and random updates to the stable
distribution, however, would nullify the entire idea of having a stable
release, Joey [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg01641.html). Hence, the same policy as before will be used for
point-releases of woody.


**Gnome2 for Woody.** Gustavo Noronha Silva [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome-0207/msg00222.html) that he was backporting Gnome2 for Woody. For installing his
packages, you have to add the line `deb
http://gluck.debian.org/~kov/debian woody gnome2` to your
`/etc/apt/sources.list`. Gustavo is backporting some applications
as well. Here are screenshots of [gdm2](https://people.debian.org/~kov/shots/gdm2-woody.png) and [Gnome2](https://people.debian.org/~kov/shots/gnome2-woody.png).


**A Review of the Release Process.** Anthony Towns [wrote](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0207/msg00094.html) a
review about the woody release process. He gave a short summary of the
release history and pointed out the main blocking things: a six month delay
before trying to release, the twelve-month-development of boot-floppies, the
fact that the CDs weren't ready in time and the late noticing that security
wasn't ready. His wishlist for sarge includes less wasted time, better
communication and transparency and a testing distribution which is kept
permanently in a releasable state.


**Help Needed with GIMP Bugs.** Martin Michlmayr [investigated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg01274.html)
bug reports against packages for GIMP 1.0 and 1.1. Both were removed from
Debian a while ago, but several bug reports are still open. Martin is looking
for someone who has some time and knows GIMP well to go through these bug
reports and either close them with an appropriate message if it's fixed in 1.2
or reassign them to the corresponding gimp1.2 package.


**Solving the libpng Problem.** Marcelo Magallon [investigated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg01106.html)
the situation with `libpng` version 2 and 3 and lists development
packages that depend on the older version of this library. Junichi Uekawa [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg01319.html) an
upgrade path for libraries that depend on the old `libpng` package.
However, people disagree on the need to change the library's SONAME when
changing the version of a library dependency.


**Ceasing Support for Linux 2.0 in Glibc.** Ben Collins [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg01627.html)
that he's going to cease support for Linux kernel prior to 2.2.0 in the
upcoming glibc release for Debian unstable. This change only affects the
architectures i386 and m68k. All others already have a similar default. This
means that if you have machine that runs a 2.0.X kernel and Debian unstable,
you'd better stay with woody or upgrade the kernel.


**Status of the debian-installer.** Tollef Fog Heen wrote a [status
report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0207/msg00546.html) about what is supposed to be the installer for sarge. Tollef will
lead its development and says that it already works for users on i386 if you
tell them what buttons they are supposed to press. Anthony Towns added some
interesting [bits](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0207/msg00548.html) to that. For those who would like to try it, [here](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0207/msg00441.html) are
step-by-step instructions for building the system.


**Future glibc Maintenance.** Ben Collins [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-glibc-0207/msg00020.html)
that he copied the Debian part of the glibc package into [CVS](http://cvs.debian.org/glibc-package/?cvsroot=glibc). In order
to use it, you'll need the glibc\_2.2.5.orig.tar.gz tarball from the archive to
go with it. Log messages of code commits are forwarded to the [debian-glibc](https://lists.debian.org/debian-glibc/) list so people
stay updated.


**Perl 5.8.0.** RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [reports](https://lists.debian.org/debian-perl-0207/msg00016.html) that
Perl 5.8.0 is released and once again we have a binary incompatibility for
binary modules. With Debian growing, this affects more packages than last
time, of course. Brendan O'Dea, the current Perl maintainer, [intends](https://lists.debian.org/debian-perl-0207/msg00019.html) to
set up a [staging area](https://people.debian.org/~bod/perl/README)
in his home directory on people.debian.org that should
help a smooth transition. In order to speed up this effort, non-maintainer
uploads (NMU) are discussed.


**Reviving SuperH.** It seems that the Debian SuperH people
would like to revive the SuperH port -- and add four new architectures with
it. Takeshi Yaegashi (八重樫剛史)
[requested](https://bugs.debian.org/154179)
the creation of binary directories for the four architectures sh3, sh4, sh3eb
and sh4eb. There is still an ongoing [discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-superh-0207/msg00016.html) about the binary incompatibility between SH3 and SH4,
though.


**Ceasing /usr/doc/.** Joey Hess [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0207/msg00023.html)
what other developers think about if he would remove the code in debhelper
that makes postinst scripts manage `/usr/doc` links. Joey added
that since we'll be recompiling a lot of packages due to the gcc 3.0 transition
anyway, we will lose the links in `/usr/doc` stuff essentially for
free. However, Adam Heath [objected](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0207/msg00039.html)
to this proposal in order to support backwards compatibility.
