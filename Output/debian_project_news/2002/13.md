Debian Weekly News - March 27th, 2002
=====================================


Welcome to this year's thirteenth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for
the Debian community.


**Daemon Outages During Upgrade.** Adrian Bridgett [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0203/msg00707.html)
a drawback of Debian, in his eyes. Before an upgrade daemons will be
stopped, then the package gets upgraded, and finally they are restarted. On
fast machines you won't notice the outage normally, but on slow machines
there's a certain amount time where the daemon in question is not running.
Adam Heath [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0203/msg00822.html) that daemons have to be stopped before an upgrade, since
`start-stop-daemon` checks the binary on the disk.


**Packages Still Located in Potato.** Otto Wyss [published](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0203/msg01548.html) a
list of packages whose files still reside in the `potato` directory
of the Debian archive. Before releasing Woody, somebody probably needs to
check if they are suitable for release and request their removal if not.
Some packages may not even be required anymore.


**Crypto Software in the Main Archive.** Anthony Towns finally
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0203/msg00019.html) that cryptographic software is permitted to be uploaded to the
main archive of Debian. Some time ago (January 2000?) the US government decided
that cryptographic software was actually already available outside the US and
that it wouldn't matter too much if the controls were relaxed. A specialized
group, consisting of Debian developers and lawyers, have prepared [legal advice](https://www.debian.org/legal/cryptoinmain) for this.
Please see Anthony's article for details.


**Preparing Another Stable Revision.** In another quixotic
attempt, Joey is [working](http://master.debian.org/~joey/2.2r6/)
on an update to the stable Debian version (alias 2.2). The list of packages
contains no less than 24 security uploads and seven important updates
currently. The plan is to get this revision out at the beginning of
April. People should comment to [Joey](mailto:joey@debian.org)
directly if they disagree.


**New IceWM Maintainer Required.** JÃ©rÃ´me Marant [told us](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0203/msg01816.html)
that the IceWM package does not have any active upstream developers anymore.
What a pity for such a nice window-manager. Since the Debian maintainer for
IceWM doesn't want to become the upstream maintainer new people are required
to keep this piece of software alive. It's been added to the [list of unmaintained free
software](http://www.unmaintained-free-software.org/).


**Project Leader Election.** The Debian Project Secretary [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0203/msg00216.html) the
first call for votes for the Debian project leader election 2002. Votes must
be received by 23:59:59 UTC on April 16th, 2002. Manoj Srivastava rewrote the
voting machinery which works a little bit [differently](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0203/msg00217.html)
to before. Apparently, there were some [problems](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0203/msg00218.html)
encountered, which have now been resolved.


**New Boot-Floppies 3.0.21.** The boot-floppies team has [released](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0203/msg01059.html) a
new set of Woody boot-floppies. Robert Bihlmeyer submitted a [success
report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0203/msg01566.html) afterwards. This set of boot-floppies is not available for
alpha, arm, s390 and sparc yet. Porters need to take care of these
architectures.

that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
