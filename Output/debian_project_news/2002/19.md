Debian Weekly News - May 8th, 2002
==================================


Welcome to this year's nineteenth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for
the Debian community.


**Hardware Detection Libraries.** People keep thinking that
Debian does not come with any sort of hardware detection. This is wrong, as
Petter Reinholdtsen [demonstrated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg02132.html),
when he wondered why Debian has so many hardware detection packages. [Jeff
Licquia](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg02415.html) and [NoÃ¨l KÃ¶the](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg00024.html)
replied and explained the virtue and history of each.


**Open Standards: Principles and Practice.** One of the
problems Bruce Perens is [facing](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg02451.html) when
he is representing SPI and Debian in various standards organisations is that
every one of them has a different definition of an Open Standard. Almost all
standards organizations allow the incorporation of software patents,
discriminatory licensing, or other features that seriously damage the
"open-ness" of the standard. Thus, Bruce is [presenting](http://perens.com/OpenStandards/) to you the first draft
of [Open Standards:
Principles and Practice](http://perens.com/OpenStandards/Definition.html) with a link for the discussion list.


**New European Debian Machine.** Wichert Akkerman [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0204/msg00019.html) a new machine to host certain parts of Debian in Europe. As
pandora has been suffering from a lack of diskspace and intermittent
networking problems for a while now, it will be replaced by satie, which is a
VA2240 donated by [VA Linux Systems](http://www.valinux.com/) and
hosted by the [Student Net Twente](http://www.snt.utwente.nl/) of
the [University of Twente](http://www.utwente.nl/). Pandora has
hosted [QA](https://qa.debian.org/), [NM](https://nm.debian.org/), [non-US](http://non-US.debian.org/) and [security.debian.org](http://security.debian.org/).


**New Debian Developer's Reference Structure.** Adam Di Carlo
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0205/msg00086.html)
his first draft of a thorough re-organization of the [New Debian Developer's
Reference](https://www.debian.org/doc/developers-reference/) which is available [here](https://people.debian.org/~aph/developers-reference/developers-reference.html/index.en.html#contents).
His intent of the re-organization is to collect the duties, resources, packaging
hints, and other things to do beyond packaging in their own chapters.


**Debian Preinstalled on HP Blade Server.** This will be of
interest mostly for those of you who use Debian in a professional environment.
Hewlett-Packard announced that their [HP Blade Server bh7800](http://www.software.hp.com/blade-servers/)
are delivered with Debian GNU/Linux (2.2r3) [preinstalled](http://www.software.hp.com/blade-servers/debian_img.htm).
The HP Blade Server bh7800 contains multiple server blades. Each server blade
is a single-board computer, running a separate operating system.


**Subproject Howto.** Ben Armstrong [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0205/msg00069.html)
writing a [subproject-howto](https://people.debian.org/~synrg/subproject-howto.html/) in debiandoc sgml. Based on the experiences starting and
sustaining a development subproject within Debian, Ben Armstrong explains how
to start a subproject within Debian, and why they are important to the
vitality and quality of Debian.


**Debiandoc-SGML Version 2.** Osamu Aoki
(青木 修) [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0205/msg00040.html) to
discuss improvements for the next generation document generation. Since Woody
is practically frozen and debiandoc-sgml is in a very complete shape for the
release, it seems to be time to collect a list of requested improvements. He
already supplied an initial list of items he would like to have changed.


**New or Noteworthy Packages.** The following packages were
added to the Debian archive recently or contain important updates.


* [fnorb](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/interpreters/fnorb)
 -- A pure Python ORB.

**Orphaned Packages.** 1 package was orphaned this week and

thanks to the previous maintainers who contributed to the Free Software
community. Please see the [WNPP pages](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/) for
the full list, and please add a note to the bug report and retitle it to ITA:

**Seen something interesting?** Please drop us a note whenever you
see something noteworthy that you think is appropriate for inclusion in DWN. We
don't see everything, unfortunately, and this month will be a busy one for us.
Of course, we are also thankful for completely written items from volunteer
writers. We're looking forward to receiving your mail at [dwn@debian.org](mailto:dwn@debian.org).
