Debian Weekly News - September 10th, 2002
=========================================


Welcome to this year's 35th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. The most interesting news for this week probably is the
removal of Qmail from Debian's [list
server](http://murphy.debian.org/lists/). Thanks to the admin and listmaster team, the [server](http://murphy.debian.org/mrtg/) now happily runs Postfix.
Additionally, those who own an X-Box, may want to run [Debian](http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/articles.php?aid=2002248060056)
on it.


**Placement of PHP Files.** Matthew Palmer wondered where [libraries](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg00063.html)
and [programs](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg00065.html) for PHP packages should be installed. There is a mini policy in
[development](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg00109.html) that will probably document the correct location for PHP
extension libraries which are written in PHP. Installing the files into
`/var/www` may end up in the wrong web space, however, installing
them into another directory and linking it into the real web space may not [work](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg00358.html) with
all web servers.


**Handling of Task Packages.** Javier FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino PeÃ±a
[asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg00119.html)
how tasks are currently handled in Debian. Joey Hess [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0209/msg00018.html)
that the canonical source of the task information is the source of
`tasksel`. Information about tasks is extracted by some program
belonging to the release manager and used to generate the relevant overrides file. That in
turn is used to populate the information to the Packages files, which are then seen by
`tasksel` and `aptitude`.


**CPU optimized OpenSSL packages?** Christoph Martin [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg00267.html)
whether there is an opinion or policy on optimized library versions. Mike
Stone [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg00278.html) that OpenSSL has processor-specific assembly routines that are
selected at compile time and Christoph [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg00394.html)
that optimizing for 80486 instead of 80386 causes a [speedup](https://bugs.debian.org/139783) of 2 times and optimizing for
sparcv8 instead of sparcv7 even results in a [speedup](https://bugs.debian.org/139996) of 8 times. Selecting some
optimization at run time would probably be worth it.


**Download of non-US illegal in US?** Richard Atterer [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0209/msg00002.html)
that the [CD FAQ](https://www.debian.org/CD/faq/#nonus) tells US residents that
it's OK for them to download software in non-us for private use. However,
since crypto software is included in the main archive, much of what is left
over in the non-US archive, includes patent-encumbered software. If a US
citizen downloads and uses such software, he might violate U.S. patents
unknowingly.


**Input from Donald Knuth on TeX License Discussion.** David
Carlisle found a [statement](http://groups.google.com/groups?ie=UTF-8&selm=5nd91y6eix.fsf%40sun.dante.de) from Donald Knuth on the distribution of modified Computer
Modern TeX fonts, that [heats](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0209/msg00058.html) up
the discussion. Even though the fonts are placed in the public domain,
modified versions should not be named as the original, which would cause a [violation](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0209/msg00073.html)
of Debian's guidelines if this is required.


**Debian Trademark in Spain.** Back in May, a person
associated to a Spanish training company obviously registered the term [Debian](http://www.marcanet.com/Acceso_Gratuito/CPRespMN.ASP?Num=1&L1=1&N=1&C1=42&Nmb=debian&Tp=Es&Sob=Marca) as trademark. Jacobo Tarrio [found out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0209/msg00033.html)
that there are three such applications. Ignacio GarcÃ­a FernÃ¡ndez [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0209/msg00096.html) an
explanation by the company in question.


**Java Policy Discussion.** Ola Lundqvist [wrote](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0208/msg00100.html) that
since woody is released he would like to propose that the proposed [Java
Policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/java-policy/) be made official. Ola is seeking comment on it and requests a
discussion. The proposed policy talks about virtual machines, Java libraries,
programs and compilers.


**Renaming Boot Script Utilities.** Henrique de Moraes
Holschuh [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0209/msg00038.html) the transition of invoke-rc.d, policy-rc.d and update-rc.d to
rc.d-invoke, rc.d-policy and rc.d-update. The transition requires a policy
change to demand the use of the new scripts now and another policy change
after sarge is released to require the use of the new scripts. Symlinks for
compatibility will be installed, so the transition won't break an existing
installation or package. Anthony Towns, though, [considers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0209/msg00047.html)
it a waste of time, for no technical benefit.


**Monitorless Installation.** Mario Lang [tries](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0209/msg00122.html) to
figure the best way to integrate accessibility support into the
debian-installer. The goal is to allow installation with completely different
display types than a normal monitor. This will allow easier installations for
the visually impaired.


**Graphical Installer?** Michael Cardenas [released](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0209/msg00062.html)
his patch to cdebconf that adds a gtk2.0 frontend. It still required a
little bit of work but others finished it and Tollef Fog Heen already [committed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0209/msg00082.html)
it. This is an important step forward in the direction of a graphical
installer for Debian.


**Bug Reports as a Mailbox.** Adam Heath [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg00468.html)
that he installed a new CGI program for the [Debian Bug
Tracking System](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/). The new CGI program supports mime parsing of the debbugs
log data and thus provides the ability to download the entire bug report and
answers as a standard mailbox file. All attachments to a particular mail also
contain download links for easy retrieving of the attachment.


**Evaluating Package Integrity.** JÃ©rÃ´me Marant [reminded](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg00066.html)
developers of a talk Martin Michlmayr gave at [Debian Conference 1](https://www.debian.org/events/2001/0704-debcon) on regression
testing of packages. Regression tests are tests that are made to ensure that
the behaviour of a given program has not changed across releases. Testing the
[installation](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg00076.html) could done by using [pbuilder](https://packages.debian.org/pbuilder). Additionally, an
existing [framework](https://packages.debian.org/debian-test) for
testing the behaviour of a package is already included in Debian.


**On Moving Configuration Files.** Joey Hess [exhorted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg00405.html)
that it is the duty of a package or its scripts respectively to deal with
moving a configuration file if the files were moved between updates. The [policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-maintainerscripts.html#s-mscriptsinstact) mentions that the maintainer should check for an upgrade to a
version in which the conffile no longer exists, and use debconf to ask the
user whether or not they would like the conffile removed.


**New DebianEdu Subproject.** RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0209/msg00001.html) the birth of the DebianEdu subproject. This subproject aims to
make Debian the best distribution available for educational use. He hopes
that this subproject will cooperate with similar initiatives like the French
[Debian Education](http://logiciels-libres-cndp.ac-versailles.fr/)
distribution (French only) and [SkoleLinux](http://developer.skolelinux.no/projectinfo.html.en) in
Norway.


**Technical Review for Debian Securing Manual.** Javier
FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino PeÃ±a is [seeking](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-0209/msg00009.html)
people for a technical review of the [Debian Securing Manual](https://www.debian.org/doc/user-manuals#securing).
Some sections require a rewrite, especially the configuration checklist, which
is no longer reflective. Also, not all translations are
up-to-date.


**Changing the Documentation Structure.** Rob Bradford [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0209/msg00015.html) to
tidy up the way the [Debian Documentation Project](https://www.debian.org/doc/ddp)
implements its namespace. Currently there doesn't seem to be a consistent
scheme. Therefore he proposed to use a directory structure like
`/doc/manuals/<lang>/<manual-name>/<format>/`,
together with specially crafted index files in each subdirectory. This will
be quite an excessive change compared with the current directory
`/doc/manuals/<manual-name>/` for HTML and
`/doc/manuals/<lang>/<manual-name>.<format>` for
other formats for most (but not all) documents. Unfortunately this would also break [content negotiation](https://www.debian.org/intro/cn).


**Reviewing Policy.** Manoj Srivastava [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0209/msg00050.html) to
review pending bug reports against [Debian Policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/). He commented on twelve such reports. They cover perl
module [naming](https://bugs.debian.org/114920), postscript file [requirements](https://bugs.debian.org/119821), [adding](https://bugs.debian.org/123074) the GNU [Free Documentation License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) to
the list of free licenses, the [menu
policy](https://bugs.debian.org/128681) and others.
