Debian Weekly News - May 29th, 2002
===================================


Welcome to this year's twenty-second issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for
the Debian community. We're sorry for a rather small issue, but Joey is
currently too busy with other things. Therefore, it is rather unlikely that
we'll be able to create an issue for the next week. One of our own [news articles](https://www.debian.org/News/2002/20020522) was apparently [quoted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg02378.html) in
the Sydney Morning Herald.


**Bandwidth Monitoring.** Brian May [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg01822.html)
what the best way with Debian would be to monitor IP packets sent/received
over an external (i.e. volume charged) connection? He wants to know how many
bytes a host A did receive on what port, which internal host received the most
external traffic etc. He included a summary and [summarized](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg01955.html)
answers as well.


**Apt Preferences** Brian May was [confused](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg01829.html)
about how `apt` treated his preferences. His setup includes the
pinning feature many people use when they mix testing and unstable. Not many
people replied, not many probably grok this feature.


**On Packaging WineX.** Last week there was some [confusion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg02165.html)
since Marc Leeman sent an [ITP](https://bugs.debian.org/147303)
(Intent to Package) for WineX, which is WINE with compatibility for games
developed using DirectX. Upstream [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg02463.html)
Debian not to distribute this package, it was said that distributing it would
hurt the upstream company and it was even said that they have [threatened](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg02174.html)
to change their license to specifically ban Debian from having such a package.
Later Marc dropped the package and [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg02823.html)
why.


**New Debian Flyers.** With regard to the upcoming [LinuxTag](https://www.debian.org/events/2002/0606-linuxtag) exhibition and
conference Jens Schmalzing and Michael Banck created a new bilingual (German
and English) flyer for Debian. This time it is created with Free Software as
long as that was possible. Even though LaTeX was involved, the [design](https://www.debian.org/events/materials/flyers/general/flyer.ps) doesn't
reflect what most people expect from it. Karl Hammar already [translated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0205/msg00436.html)
the flyer into Swedish and Brazilian people seem to be interested as well.
Printing in Germany is sponsored by [credativ](http://www.credativ.de/).
