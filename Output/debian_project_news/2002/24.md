Debian Weekly News - June 25th, 2002
====================================


Welcome to this year's twentyfourth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for
the Debian community. In order to improve the quality of DWN and to let new
contributors know how we put together each issue, we updated the [contributing page](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/contributing). Here's a nice
[quote](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0206/msg01234.html)
from JÃ©rÃ´me Marant: The good work Debian folks are doing on their packages is
the real secret for APT's magic.


**Preliminary XFree86 4.2.0 Packages.** Branden Robinson
finally [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-x-0206/msg00029.html) preliminary [packages](https://people.debian.org/~branden/sid/) for XFree86 4.2.0. Thanks to Branden and [Ishikawa
Mutsumi (石川むつみ)](https://lists.debian.org/debian-x-0206/msg00014.html)
for the great work. As Branden has mentioned before, Debian
provides the cross-platform testbed for XFree86. The XFree86.org developers only build
for i386. Additionally, Werner Heuser set up a [Mini HOWTO](http://mobilix.org/debian_xfree42.html) about
Debian-XFree86 v4.2, and Adam Heath and Tollef Fog Heen set up a [mirror list](http://raw.no/x4.2/).


**Debian used in French Schools.** The Debian system is used
as basis for a [distribution](ftp://ftp.logidee.com/debian-educ/iso/) of GNU/Linux used in French schools. It uses a customized
installer. The system will
install on a single disk, either empty or with a single vfat partition. In
order to install it, the user only has to boot from the CD. The installation
process is in French and installs a working Debian system in less than 20
minutes. There is more [information](http://logiciels-libres-cndp.ac-versailles.fr/annonce.html)
with links pointing to French documents.


**Developer's Reference Updated.** RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0206/msg00007.html) that a new version of the [Developer's
Reference](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/) has been installed in the archive. The number of changes is
said to be impressive and include: documentation of testing, the Package
Tracking System, the new incoming system, IRC channels, `madison`,
new maintainer sponsoring and a completely new chapter covering Best Packaging Practices.


**GNU FDL 1.2 Draft Comment Summary Posted.** The [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) finally released the
[comments](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.2-comments.txt) they
received after publishing the [license draft](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.2-draft.txt) for the
GNU Free Documentation License (FDL), which Branden Robinson [asked for](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0205/msg00076.html)
quite a while ago. However, since Branden is unhappy with the current
situation, he [intends](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0206/msg00036.html)
to develop the Debian Free Content License (DFCL) which will be unambiguously
DFSG-free. Hence, the [APS
Free Game License](http://aps.sacredchao.net/legal.shtml#rag) and the [Design
Science License](http://dsl.org/copyleft/dsl.txt) were mentioned.


**Additional Restrictions for the GPL?** A [question](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0206/msg00156.html)
came up on the [debian-legal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/) list whether the author is permitted to add some kind of
advertisement clause to the license of a package which is otherwise licensed
using the GNU [General Public
License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). Branden Robinson [explains](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0206/msg00178.html) in
detail why this package doesn't seem to comply with the [Debian Free Software
Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines).


**Prettyprinting Java Code?** Every once in a while
programmers would like to print their code on paper, either for review or for
archiving. However, plain code does look boring. Hence, it's always good to
use a beautifier before actually printing the code, so keywords get printed
bold, etc. For e-mail there are [mp](https://packages.debian.org/mp)
and [muttprint](https://packages.debian.org/muttprint), for C, C++,
Java, Shell, Perl and Verilog there is [trueprint](https://packages.debian.org/trueprint). For Java you may
also use [tinyc2l](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/tinyc2l.html).


**Multilingual General Debian Flyers.** Several Debian people have
recently worked on an updated general [flyer](https://www.debian.org/events/materials/flyers/general/) that informs about
the Debian project and the Debian distribution. It should be used at
[international exhibitions](https://www.debian.org/events/) whenever the Debian
project is invited to attend. It uses free software
(i.e. LaTeX) and is organized as bilingual flyer when printed on both sides of
a sheet of paper. The copyright has been [assigned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0206/msg00246.html) to [Software in the Public Interest, Inc.](https://www.spi-inc.org/) and
the flyer source is already available in
[German](https://www.debian.org/events/materials/flyers/general/deutsch.tex),
[English](https://www.debian.org/events/materials/flyers/general/english.tex),
[French](https://www.debian.org/events/materials/flyers/general/francaise.tex),
[Italian](https://www.debian.org/events/materials/flyers/general/italiano.tex),
[Dutch](https://www.debian.org/events/materials/flyers/general/nederlands.tex),
[Portuguese](https://www.debian.org/events/materials/flyers/general/portugues.tex)
and
[Swedish](https://www.debian.org/events/materials/flyers/general/svenska.tex).


**PGI based Woody Installer.** Branden Robinson [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0206/msg01348.html)
that in light of the imminent release of Debian 3.0, also known as Woody,
Progeny Linux Systems is publishing a beta version of a Woody installer, which
is based on their [Progeny Graphical
Installer](http://hackers.progeny.com/pgi/) (PGI) software. ISO Images of this installer are available from
[archive.progeny.com](http://archive.progeny.com/progeny/pgi/).


**Reorganizing Debian's Documentation.** Osamu Aoki
(青木 修) [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0206/msg00075.html) to
reorganize the documentation which Debian installs on the users system in
`/usr/share/doc`, similar to RFC and HOWTO documents.
This will provide more consistent file location and other benefits like easier
integration on CDs, documentation, which is easier to find, and consistency.


**Easier Translation of Debian's Web Pages.** Denis Barbier
posted a [request for comments](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0206/msg00147.html) to [debian-www](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www/) regarding a new way to do translations. Earlier, there have
been many problems regarding the so-called slices, in which multiple languages
are present in the same file. This causes problems for some multi-byte
encodings, such as Japanese. Denis came up with a solution which uses the
familiar gettext method and .po files.


**Debian on Rank 35 on Supercomputer List.** The last [International Supercomputing Conference](http://www.isc2002.org/)
recently took place in Heidelberg, Germany. The [University of Heidelberg](http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/) did not only
host this year's conference but also built their own cluster at
the [Interdisciplinary
Center for Scientific Computing](http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/) (IWR), which uses Debian as
basic operating system. This cluster is the world's fastest computer cluster
running GNU/Linux and made it to [rank 35](http://www.top500.org/list/2002/06/).
