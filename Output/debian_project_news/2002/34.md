Debian Weekly News - September 3rd, 2002
========================================


Welcome to this year's 34th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Good news is coming from Venezuela, since [Linux Today](http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-08-30-011-26-NW-LL-PB) reports that all software developed for the government must be
licensed under the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).


**OpenOffice.org uploaded to Unstable.** Chris Halls recently
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-openoffice-0208/msg00126.html) that Rene Engelhard has finally uploaded OpenOffice.org 1.0.1-5
to unstable/contrib. The packages contain a large set of help documents and
internationalization files for 18 languages. However, since the package is
new to the Debian archive, it will take a while before the files appear in the
public archive. Chris Halls also [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-openoffice-0208/msg00138.html) translated [help
files](http://sf1.mirror.openoffice.org/miscellaneous/helpcontent).


**Revising old ITP Reports.** Bas Zoetekouw [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01632.html)
that he is going to move very old ITP bugs (Intent to Package) into RFP bugs
(Request for Packaging). He only plans this for reports that are one year old
or even older. For such old intents it is unlikely that the original reporter
is still working on these packages. However, some of them were already
uploaded very recently and will be excluded.


**Security Notification Script.** Rob Bradford [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01644.html) a
[script](http://www.robster.org.uk/files/security-update-check.py)
that compares locally installed packages with those on [security.debian.org](http://security.debian.org/). Furthermore it
provides a description of the problem and the name of the Debian advisory if
the package is mentioned in the [DSA RDF](https://www.debian.org/security/dsa.rdf)
file. The [Resource Description
Framework](http://www.w3.org/RDF/) is used as an information interchange format for various things.


**Wearable Debian.** We have been notified that Debian is [used](http://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/mithril/overview.html) at
the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu/)
(MIT) for a research platform for wearable computers. The goal of the [MIThril](http://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/mithril/) project is the
development and prototyping of new techniques of human-computer interaction
for body-worn applications. The systems running Debian are based on a StrongARM
processor.


**The Debian Bug-Fixing Game.** Andrew Suffield [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0208/msg00210.html)
whether turning bug-fixing into a game would help Debian reduce the list of
open bugs. This could be a counterbalance to the huge quantities of time
which moon-buggy and frozen-bubble have taken away from Debian development.
Andres Salomon [warned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0208/msg00212.html)
that this could change the goal people have to changes from fixing bugs to
simply closing them. Here's a [summary](https://people.debian.org/~mbanck/debbugs-log) from an
associated IRC discussion.


**No uncompressed Packages Files anymore.** Anthony Towns [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0208/msg00008.html) that in a couple of days time uncompressed Packages files for unstable
will cease to be generated, and bzip2'ed Packages files will be generated in
their place. Similarly, the Contents-\*.gz files for unstable will probably be
switching to .bz2 in the not too distant future. Adam Heath [pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01970.html) out
that this is likely to break `apt-get` when using file uris.


**Automatic Bug Closing revised.** Gerfried 'Alfie' Fuchs was
annoyed by the current system of how bugs are closed and [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01795.html) a
change. Bug reports referring to bugs in testing or stable will be
automatically closed when a new package was uploaded into unstable, even
though the bug still exists in stable and testing. Alfie [proposed](https://bugs.debian.org/158434) a stronger connection
between the Bug Tracking System and the testing scripts and offered
his assistance.


**Problems with Testing Migration?** Michael Meskes [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01685.html)
that packages don't seem to make it into the testing distribution currently
and wondered if there are any serious problems. Anthony Towns [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01710.html)
that the glibc package in unstable has release critical bugs assigned against
it, which keeps it out of testing, which in turn keeps other packages from
entering testing, if they depend on glibc.


**Debian Developer Packages Overview.** Igor Genibel [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01692.html)
the new [interface](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php/)
to the packages overview system. It is meant to combine links to all
information that is relevant for a package maintainer. The interface helps a
maintainer to keep track of what is going on with their packages with a
particular focus on dependencies and porting issues. At one time it was discussed
start my.debian.org for such purpose.


**Free TrueType Fonts?** Michael Cardenas [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0208/msg00294.html)
how to continue to be able to distribute more free fonts (other than dustismo
and metatype). He came across a [list](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/originalfonts.html) of original
font authors and [contacted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0208/msg00323.html) some
of them. Simon Law pointed at the [freefont](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freefont) effort and the
[ttfmod](http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/TtfMod/) utility for
creating and modifying TrueType hinting. Additionally, Peter Novodvorsky
(Петр
Новодворский)
pointed at [fonts](ftp://ftp.gnome.ru/fonts/) that were converted
from GPLed URW PostScript fonts with manual rehinting done and cyrillic glyphs
added, and Brian Carlson [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0208/msg00419.html) links
to public domain fonts.


**Is Apsfilter non-free?** Ville Muikkula [stomped](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0208/msg00360.html)
over potential [postcardware](https://foldoc.org/postcardware) in the apsfilter package. The license, though, looks more
like a "should" and not a "must", which should be fine. However, in order to
solve this issue Osamu Aoki (青木 修)
[contacted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0208/msg00370.html)
the author.


**Customizing Applications for a common Look.** Erich Schubert
[wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01916.html)
whether Debian should create and distribute a nice Debian theme for KDE and
GNOME, like other distributors do. Yenar Calentaure [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01925.html) that
every other major distribution has its own look, Debian can differentiate from
them by sticking with the upstream look and proposed providing Debian
wallpaper, logos and icons.


**Debian based CD based Distributions.** Dale Scheetz [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg02018.html)
about two distributions that are based on Debian and run directly from CD.
Dale says that it appears that Debian is finally being used in the ways that
the project had been wishing for since before Bruce Perens was project leader.
Dale includes a report about [Knoppix](http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/) from a German development group and [Demolinux](http://www.demolinux.org/) from a French development
group.


**Uploading more than one Architecture.** Dale Scheetz [pondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg02027.html)
whether it would be useful and helpful to upload packages for more than one
architecture in parallel with the source. Ryan Murray [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg02032.html)
that it won't speed up the build process a lot since build daemons pick up new
packages once they're accepted by the archive. However, it could be even
worse if the maintainer misses an architecture-specific transition and the
package requires a binary-only upload for the particular architecture.
