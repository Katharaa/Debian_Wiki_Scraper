Debian Weekly News - December 17th, 2002
========================================


Welcome to this year's 49th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. David Graham, leader of the [Open and Free Technology Community](http://www.oftc.net/) (OFTC)
which hosts several IRC channels for Debian, [talks](http://www.newsforge.com/newsforge/02/12/01/1559223.shtml?tid=11)
about how OFTC manages itself.


**Is the Debian Project unmanageable?** Recent discussions
about the [voting
system](http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~wwwstoch/voss/comp/vote.html) of Debian lead David Welton to [ask](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0212/msg00051.html) [whether](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0212/msg00041.html) the
Debian project has reached a state where it is no longer manageable. Maybe
Debian needs to recognize that the power is already in the hands of those who
actually do things, and align the control structures accordingly.


**Online Browsing of Changelog and Copyright Files.** NoÃ¨l
KÃ¶the [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00558.html) to extract changelog and copyright files of Debian packages and
placed them on a [webserver](http://changelogs.credativ.org/).
This is something that is currently missing from [packages.debian.org](https://packages.debian.org/), however, it [should](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00560.html) be
possible to use the lintian lab on gluck for this, now that lintian is running
regularly, said Colin Watson.


**Helping External .deb Producers.** Aaron Isotton [intends](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00594.html) to
work on a new document that explains how software producers can distribute
their software directly in the .deb format. He is seeking input and
suggestions for this document. Sean Perry, however, [said](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00624.html) that
it does only make little sense for a third party to provide Debian packages since
the LSB requires rpm support only.


**New Glibc in Preparation.** Jeff Bailey [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-glibc-0212/msg00099.html)
that he is about to finish a new set of glibc source, which should build fine
on most architectures and is already tested on some. It should also fix
several known problems in the current version. It will also conflict with
older versions of some other packages that broke with the current glibc.


**PornView's problematic Debut.** PornView is an image viewer
that was recently added to the Debian archive. Christian Surchi [pointed out](https://bugs.debian.org/171988) that certain images in
PornView lacked copyright permissions and Jan Schumacher [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0212/msg00112.html)
whether the logo qualified as pornography. This problem was fixed, however,
Oliver Bolzer [pointed out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0212/msg00159.html)
the [allegation](http://www.homa.ne.jp/~ashie/diary/?200212b&to=200212122#200212122) (Japanese only) that PornView uses much source code from
GImageView, but stripped the original copyright notices. Brian Nelson [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0212/msg00168.html)
that this is already fixed upstream.


**Debian-Installer with SE Linux Kernel.** Brian May [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00540.html)
that he created a [debian-installer
disk](http://www.microcomaustralia.com.au/debian/net-1440.img) with a kernel that has SE-Linux, EVMS, FreeS/WAN support, and ACL
support. Whilst the image cannot yet be used to install Debian, Brian thought
that it was a good demonstration of what is possible with the modular design
of debian-installer.


**APT Manual Pages.** Earlier this year, Susan Kleinmann [pointed out](https://lists.debian.org/deity-0211/msg00103.html) some
deficiencies in the apt\_preferences manual page. Thomas Hood sent an [update](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00659.html)
advising that Susan has rewritten the entire manual page. Feedback and
revisions are now being taken and a final product is expected soon.


**Testing Packages for Unstable?** Marek Habersack [complained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00809.html)
that too many developers are uploading packages to sid (unstable) without
doing enough testing first. It seems to Marek that some packages are uploaded
without even being installed on the developer's system first. Some people [thought](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00816.html)
Marek was being too harsh, while others [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00908.html)
improvements to the development system. Matt Zimmerman [advised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00917.html)
that he has the beginnings of a UML-based tool for automatic package testing,
however he has limited time and his hands full with other projects.


**Downgrading from Sarge to Woody.** DebianPlanet carries an
[article](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://www.debianplanet.org/node.php?id=880) about how to
downgrade from a Debian sarge system (testing) to a woody system (stable).
The writer explains that his second workstation has now become another server
and needs the stability and security of Debian woody. The article describes
the process of downgrading with several scripts and command snippets.


**Why OpenOffice.org is not in Main?** When John Goerzen read
the last issue of DWN, he [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00721.html)
why OpenOffice.org resides in contrib instead of main, since it was released
under the [GNU General Public
License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). Steve Langasek explained that the package currently depends on
specific non-free Java implementations, but Guido Guenther [mentioned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00777.html)
that Red Hat builds OpenOffice.org with gcj only.


**Private Katie Installation.** Katie (or rather Debian Archive Katie) is
the software that manages the Debian archive (for non-US, security and the
main archive). Brian May [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00735.html)
that he got the [katie
system](http://cvs.debian.org/dak/?cvsroot=dak) running and explained the steps and configuration issues he worked
on. However, James Troup even actively [discourages](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00752.html)
to use this suite.


**Free Scripts with non-free Interpreters.** Steve Langasek [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0212/msg00161.html)
how to treat scripts that were released under the GNU General Public License,
but don't run on a sufficiently free interpreter. The Free Software
Foundation [states](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq#InterpreterIncompat)
that there is no problem as long as the script is only interpreted but not
linked to a non-free component.


**Creating a GUI for Jigdo?** Chris Severance [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0212/msg00020.html) that
Jigdo currently lacks a graphical user interface (GUI) and proposed how it
should work. Richard Atterer already [planned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0212/msg00028.html) such a
program but ran into trouble assigning time to it. His current favourite idea
is that the Jigdo GUI application registers itself with the web browser. That
way a popup window will open if one clicks on the first ".jigdo" link.


**Adding ReiserFS Support to parted.** Timshel Knoll is [seeking](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0212/msg00041.html)
advice on how to add support for ReiserFS to the disk partition and resizing
program [parted](https://packages.debian.org/parted). The solution
seems to be to dynamically load a particular version of the shared ReiserFS
library.


**Shipping XML/SGML Documentation with Source?** Adam Di Carlo
[wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0212/msg00036.html) whether it is good practice for SGML and XML documentation to be
shipped with the corresponding source code? The [consensus](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0212/msg00130.html)
on the debian-doc list (with the exception of Colin Walters) was that XML/SGML
source is in fact source and shouldn't be there bloating binary packages.


**Proposed SPI By-Laws Amendment.** Jimmy Kaplowitz [proposed](http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-general/2002-December/000523.html) an amendment to the [by-laws](https://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/by-laws/) of [SPI](https://www.spi-inc.org/) that will reduce the quorum for
meetings to four people. Article five requires that 14 contributing members
second this proposal in order for it to be considered. After this, the
secretary has 30 days to put it to a vote of the contributing membership.
Some people [objected](http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-general/2002-December/000573.html) against this since a too small part of the board of directors
could make decisions.


**Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 Updated.** Nearly five months
after Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 was released, Debian finally [updated](https://www.debian.org/News/2002/20021216) the woody release. This
revision adds 59 security updates to the stable release, that were formerly
distributed through [security.debian.org](https://www.debian.org/security/), and
33 important bugfixes to various packages. Details of this update are on the
[preparation page](https://people.debian.org/~joey/3.0r1/).
