Debian Weekly News - July 16th, 2002
====================================


Welcome to this year's 27th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. This week we received an [article](http://members.optusnet.com.au/~knigits/articles/switched_back.html) from somebody who switched back from GNU/Linux and another [article](http://people.trustcommerce.com/~adam/top10/wrong.html) that
lists major alleged deficiencies of GNU/Linux. They may contain problems from
a users point of view, which developers take care of. If you want to know
what happens when Debian geeks are bored on IRC, read this [logbook](https://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa-0206/msg00049.html).


**GNU/Linux Team Fighting?** The FIFA World Cup 2002 in Korea
and Japan ended on June 30, 2002. Surprisingly, the Korean Republic impressed
everybody in the world in both soccer game and supporters power
(i.e. spirit of the Red
Devils). Before the end, an interesting [fun image](http://www.piselli.com/images/linux_team_fighting.jpg) was
posted on the news group [han.comp.os.linux.advocacy](http://groups.google.com/groups?group=han.comp.os.linux.advocacy). This kind of parody is based on "Korea
Team Fighting" which means "Go Korea Team". Penguins, Gnu, Chameleon and
Dragonfly are displayed in the Korean soccer team uniform.


**DebConf 2 successfully finished.** The third Debian
Conference, this year held in Toronto, Canada, is over. Thanks go out to Joe
Drew for hosting the conference. He has already posted some of his [experiences](https://people.debian.org/~drew/). Michael Cardenas from
Lindows.com also wrote a [report](http://www.hyperpoem.net/debconf/debconf2.html) and James
Treacy took a [bunch of
pictures](https://people.debian.org/~treacy/debconf/). Tollef Fog Heen created a [list](http://raw.no/debconf2/) of some of the different
presentations.


**Debian on your Cellular Phone?** No, it won't run Debian.
At least, it won't run it at the moment, but we'll better check what
processors future cellular phones will be built upon. Christian Wenke [played](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2002/27/mail#mail1) with [scmxx](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/comm/scmxx), which
exchanges data with Siemens mobile phones, such as logos, address books short
messages etc. The Debian logo included in that package is useful for large
screens only, but Christian created [one](https://www.debian.org/events/materials/cellular/debian-logo-sm25i.bmp) for small displays (like for the M25i or S35i), based on the [image](http://gnuart.onshore.com/images/debian/buttons/button_4.jpg)
from onShore. Christian provided the commandline required for uploading the
image to your phone.


**What Packages need to go into Non-US?** Matt Kraai [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0207/msg00029.html) which
packages still have to go into the non-US repository. Free software that
makes use of cryptographic methods [may](https://www.debian.org/legal/cryptoinmain) be uploaded into the main archive
already, however, non-free software, that uses cryptography, must not. The
non-US repository also contains program code which needs to be stored on a
non-US server because of United States patents.


**Hewlett-Packard chooses Debian.** Robert McMillan wrote
in [Linux
Magazine](http://www.linux-mag.com/2002-03/debian_01.html) about HP announcing plans to standardize its internal Linux
development on one distribution: Debian. Cnet also featured a similar [article](http://news.com.com/2100-1001-257405.html), which itself is
based on a [message](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0105/msg00769.html)
from Bruce Perens from May 2001, in which he announced that HP choose Debian
as the selected development platform (among others) for their Linux work.
Bruce explains that the [Debian Free Software
Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) (DFSG) are a critical component used for that reasoning.


**Debian Mini-Conf in January.** The upcoming [Linux Conference Australia](http://www.linux.conf.au/) (LCA) will
host a miniature DebConf on January 20th and 21st, two days prior to LCA. The
Debian part will be organized by Jonathan Oxer, who has already set up a [preliminary schedule](http://lca.apt-cacher.org/) and is looking for
interesting talks and presentations. If you would like to attend this
Mini-Conf, please check the above page.


**New Stable Revision Released.** Joey finally got around and
[released](https://www.debian.org/News/2002/20020713) another revision (r7) of
Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (codename `potato'). This revision adds 12 more security
updates to the stable distribution of Debian, covering packages like analog,
Apache, CUPS, IMP/Horde, listar, sudo and UUCP. A few important corrections
were added as well, which cover packages like erlang, qpopper and vrweb. See
the [preparation page](https://people.debian.org/~joey/2.2r7/) for
details.


**Rendez-vouz with Ian Jackson.** Robert McQueen [interviewed](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://www.debianplanet.org/node.php?id=735) Ian Jackson
for [DebianPlanet](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://debianplanet.org/), a Debian member
since the early days. He joined the Debian effort, because he got fed up of
maintaining his system by hand (a common reason, together with the [sophisticated ideology](https://www.debian.org/social_contract) behind
the project, by the way). Ian explains how `dpkg` was introduced
and how he believes that package maintenance should interact with a user
frontend.


**Creating a Free Font.** Dustin Norlander, an amateur font
designer, [contacted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00300.html) the Debian people, seeking help with licensing a new font family
which should be considered a free font with regards to the [DFSG](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines). Jim Gettys
[asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00325.html)
that it might be wise to retain control of the name of the font, even while
allowing other derivative works. This way there won't exist conflicting
versions of the same font using the same name. David Starner [raised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00405.html) some
important questions, though, which remained unanswered.


**Checking Package Integrity?** Jakub Turski [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00336.html) if
it currently was possible to add a malicious package to the main ftp site and
nobody noticing this? Anthony Towns [pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00421.html) to
a [script](https://people.debian.org/~ajt/apt-check-sigs) that
checks signatures and checksums. Colin Watson [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00481.html) that
the [ftpmaster's
key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/ziyi_key_2002.asc) needs to be added to the `trustedkeys.gpg` files instead of
the regular `pubkey.gpg` file.


**Sending Patches Upstream?** Mateusz Papiernik [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00563.html)
whether patches to Debian packages, which fix bugs, should be sent upstream as
well. Simon Law [answered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00570.html)
that we want upstream packages to be bug-free, too. That said, all useful
patches, which make Debian packages more stable, less buggy, improve their
portability etc., should be sent upstream as well.


**Glibc up for Adoption.** Ben Collins [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00670.html)
that he doesn't have the time to work properly on the GNU C library. Hence,
he's looking for one developer with shitloads of time and skill, or a team of
2-3 with average time, and good skills. The library requires an extra amount
of clue, so as not to break the 11+ architectures that depend on it to work
perfectly. Ben would love to see `binutils`, `gcc` and
`glibc` maintained by a single coordinated team, and the three
built in some sort of bootstrap setup.


**Debian at Webb.it 2002.** Federico Di Gregorio sent in a [report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0207/msg00006.html)
about the [Webb.it 2002 event](https://www.debian.org/events/2002/0705-webbit) in
Padova, Italy. Federico says that almost 40Â % of the people coming to the
booth never heard of Debian or Free Software before. Hence, it was a pleasure
to talk to them and explain about our philosophy. The report also contains
links to three picture archives.


**New or Noteworthy Packages.** The following packages were
added to the Debian archive recently or contain important updates. Aside from
the following packages, a lot of kernel and port specific packages were
included (such as legacy utilities for powerpc and m68k machines and a lot of
Hurd packages).


* [mls](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/mail/mls)
 -- MailListStat displays statistics about mailbox files.
* [numlockx](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/numlockx)
 -- Control the state of NumLock.
* [php4-pear-log](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/php4-pear-log)
 -- Log module for PEAR.
* [tlf](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/hamradio/tlf)
 -- Console mode purpose CW keyer, logging- and contest program.


**Orphaned Packages.** One package was orphaned this week and
requires a new maintainer. This makes a total of 83 orphaned packages. Many
thanks to the previous maintainer who contributed to the Free Software
community. Please see the [WNPP pages](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/) for
the full list, and please add a note to the bug report and retitle it to ITA:
if you plan to take over a package.


* [aethera](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/mail/aethera)
 -- Email and PIM application for KDE.
 ([Bug#152941](https://bugs.debian.org/152941))


**Seen something interesting?** Please drop us a note whenever
you see something noteworthy that you think is appropriate for inclusion in
DWN. We don't notice everything, unfortunately. Of course, we are also
thankful for completely written items from volunteer writers. Please see the
[contributing page](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/contributing). We're
looking forward to receiving your mail at [dwn@debian.org](mailto:dwn@debian.org).
