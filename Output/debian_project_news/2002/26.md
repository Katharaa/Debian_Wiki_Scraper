Debian Weekly News - July 9th, 2002
===================================


Welcome to this year's 26th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for
the Debian community. Michael Golly informed us that you can finally
order Woody on a DVD+R (for i386) at his [online shop](http://www.liniso.de/shop.php). From the
ministry of truth: What if you were a package? Don't know? [Find out
yourself](http://www.pigdog.org/features/dpn.html).


**500 Users in German Debianforum.** Sebastian Feltel
told us that [debianforum.de](http://www.debianforum.de/)
has added its 500th registered member. The forum has been running for about six
months and aims at German speaking users. With threads like "how to
install X", debianforum.de has turned into an important site for both the
Debian beginner and the professional in German speaking countries.


**RFC: LaTeX Public Project License.** Claire Connelly
[reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0207/msg00005.html) that the LaTeX Project is in the process of considering
changes to the LaTeX Project Public License. She tried to summarize
some of the concerns that Debian people have expressed regarding the changes.
Hence, Frank Mittelbach asked for reviews of the draft of version 1.3
of the [LaTeX
Public Project License](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0207/msg00007.html) rather than of the current version (1.2).


**Managing a System's Configuration.** Alex Borges [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0207/msg00003.html)
the Debian community how they manage configuration since he recently
arrived at the point where he requires revision control for his
configuration. The answers were impressive and included [prcs](https://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0207/msg00004.html),
[comfortable rcs](https://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0207/msg00007.html), [Emacs](https://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0207/msg00008.html),
[rcs](https://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0207/msg00016.html) with Makefile and an extended version using [cvs](https://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0207/msg00054.html).


**Permissions on Multiuser Web Server.** Jason Lim [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0207/msg00033.html)
how he is supposed to set up directories and permissions on a web
server with user owned directories mentioned in the configuration of
Apache. If such a directory gets removed, Apache won't start anymore.
In return, Peter Palfrader [provided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0207/msg00037.html)
a complex but working setup.


**Lost Speed for LaTeX Startup?** Rainer Dorsch [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-tetex-maint-0206/msg00020.html) that `latex` descended his entire home
directory at startup. On large home directories and network mounted
systems this can slow down its startup significantly. It [turned out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-tetex-maint-0206/msg00021.html) that this behaviour was triggered by a double slash in
the search path for kpathsea, which refers to scanning the entire
directory structure from that point. [kpathsea](http://www.tug.org/kpathsea/) is a library for path
searching, which is mainly used for TeX and its utilities.


**Development of Debian FreeBSD i386.** Nathan Hawkins
[released](https://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0205/msg00000.html) his plans for porting the Debian system to FreeBSD on the
i386 architecture. The midterm goals include to get a build system
up, running a buildd (Debian's own automatic package builder) and to
become a [supported
architecture](https://bugs.debian.org/146977) in the Debian Archive. Interestingly, XFree86 is
already [running](https://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0205/msg00003.html) but needs patches to be cleaned up.


**Experimental NetBSD Install Disks.** Matthew Garrett
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0206/msg00005.html) highly experimental [installation
disks](http://www.srcf.ucam.org/debian-netbsd/floppies/) for Debian GNU/NetBSD. After booting they continue with a
network installation of the Debian system. However, these disks are
only useful for development and don't install an entire operating
system. You should not use them on a system that contains important
data which you haven't stored in a backup.


**Woody Release Status.** Anthony Towns sent in
another [status report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0207/msg00005.html) in which he discusses the reasons that currently
delay the Woody release. The security build infrastructure still has
its flaws that need to be addressed. There is still a backlog of
security related problems which need to be fixed before the release.
Even with those problems, it looks like the release is close.


**Wiki-based Documentation Project.** Morten Hustveit
brought up the idea of using a [Wiki-based](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0205/msg00206.html)
system where users can freely add and modify documentation about the
Debian project. The purpose of any Wiki is to provide an easy medium
to share information with anyone who wishes to learn. A [Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/) system associated to the
Debian project has already been set up and even contains a
collaborative document for [system
administration](https://wiki.debian.org/SystemAdministration). Alternatively, the [Debian](http://www.superant.com/cgi-bin/slencyclopedia.pl?Debian)
section of the [SuperLinux
Encyclopedia](http://slencyclopedia.berlios.de/) could be used.


**Introducing NEWS.Debian.** Joey Hess [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00267.html)
from a discussion they had during DebConf about the issue of overuse
of debconf notes for warning the user of things like major changes on
upgrades. One idea that came up is adding a NEWS.Debian file to
supplement the README.Debian and changelog.Debian files. This would
require tools like [apt-listchanges](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/apt-listchanges) to parse and display this file.


**To su in X.** Osamu Aoki (青木 修) is [soliciting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00259.html)
learned opinion and would like to know which recommendation he should
give to the reader of the [Debian
Reference](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/quick-reference/) for running graphical programs as root while using X as
user. The main question, however, is where to place legacy code to
reduce typing. An unpackaged tool [sux](http://fgouget.free.fr/sux/sux-readme.shtml) was
mentioned as a possible solution, but since it's not yet available in
Debian...


**Rewriting MAKEDEV?** Andres Salomon [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00270.html)
to work on a replacement for the `MAKEDEV` script which
does nasty things and has some flaws. Since it's located in the
system binaries directory, it must not depend upon anything from
`/usr`, so using a highlevel language isn't possible; this
leaves shell and C.
