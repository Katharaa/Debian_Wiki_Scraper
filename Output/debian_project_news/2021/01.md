The Release Team announced that [bullseye reached the soft freeze milestone on 2021-02-12](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2021/02/msg00002.html). This freeze
allows only small targeted fixes for the next release. New transitions or

Important Debian Security Advisories
------------------------------------


 Debian's Security Team releases current advisories on a daily basis
([Security Advisories 2021](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/)). Please
read them carefully and subscribe to the [security mailing
list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) to keep your systems updated against any vulnerabilities.


Some recently released advisories concern these packages:
[pygments](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4870),
[tiff](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4869),
[flatpack](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4868),
[grub2](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4867),
[thunderbird](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4866),
[docker.io](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4865),
[firefox](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4862),
[screen](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4861),

The Debian website also [archives](https://www.debian.org/lts/security/)
the security advisories issued by the Debian Long Term Support team and posted to the
[debian-lts-announce mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/).



Securing GRUB2 UEFI SecureBoot 2021
-----------------------------------


Since the [BootHole](https://www.debian.org/security/2020-GRUB-UEFI-SecureBoot)
group of bugs announced in GRUB2 in July 2020, security researchers and
developers in Debian and elsewhere have continued to look for further issues
that might allow for circumvention of UEFI Secure Boot. Several more have been
found. See [Debian Security Advisory 4867-1](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4867)
for more complete details. Debian published a very informative
[statement](https://www.debian.org/security/2021-GRUB-UEFI-SecureBoot/)
aiming to explain the consequences of these security vulnerabilities, and what
steps have been taken to address them.



News on Debian bullseye
-----------------------


**Homeworld, the default artwork and theme for bullseye**



We send congratulations to Juliette Taka for her winning submission of
[Homeworld](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianArt/Themes/Homeworld),
which will be the default theme and artwork for Debian 11 bullseye. Over
5,613 votes were cast between [18
submissions](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDesktop/Artwork/Bullseye). We thank all who contributed and voted in the process which
was a delightful refresher showing how much of a community Debian truly is.

bugs need to be fixed by Debian Contributors to get Debian 11.0 bullseye released.


However, in the view of the Release Managers,
[**182**](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?release=bullseye&patch=&pending=&security=ign&wontfix=&upstream=&unreproducible=&forwarded=&claimed=&deferred=&notmain=ign&notbullseye=ign&base=&standard=&merged=ign&done=&outdatedbullseye=&outdatedsid=&needmig=&newerubuntu=&fnewer=&fnewerval=7&rc=1&sortby=source&sorto=asc&cpopcon=1&cseverity=1&ctags=1)
need to be dealt with for the release to happen.


Please see [Interpreting the
release critical bug statistics](https://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats) for an explanation of the different numbers.

Discussions
-----------


Debian Developer Stephan Lachnit asked: [*Is it
possible to contribute to Debian without using one's real name out of privacy concerns*](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2021/02/msg00282.html)?


William Torrez Corea asked: [*How to
upgrade the O/S to Debian buster*](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2021/01/msg00321.html)? The thread discussion regards
reinstalling vs. upgrading vs. rebuilding, and a synopsis of Sid/Stable/Testing.



Jerry Mellon asked: [*How to add
a hard drive to an existing system*](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2021/01/msg00584.html)? Easy read which shows some pitfalls
and workarounds to this very common task.



Dan Hitt asked: [*How to install
Debian 10 without CD or USB access but with ethernet and Hard Disk
usage*](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2021/01/msg00746.html)? This discussion covers a very fast bios, pxeboot options, grub
menuentry entries, netboot, and a hd-media kernel solution.


John Berden asked: [*How to fix
an incorrect password in Debian 10.8 after installation*](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2021/02/msg00164.html)?. This thread
touches on grub editing at startup, grub persistence, a miniature emacs and grub
editor syntax lesson, and canonical shell behaviour.

* Craig Small, explains the [CPU/pcpu
field of the ps program](https://dropbear.xyz/2021/01/18/percent-cpu-for-processes/), most of us run it as ps aux. Here is a great
