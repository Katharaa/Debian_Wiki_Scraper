Debian & Stuff podcast
----------------------



Asheesh Laroia and Sam Erbs have started a podcast entitled
[Debian and Stuff](http://www.debianandstuff.com/).
The first episode,
[Moin Moin Vs.
MediaWiki](http://www.debianandstuff.com/listen/1mmvm), was recorded at DebConf14 and contains a little bit
of Debian and a lot of stuff discussed between Sam and Asheesh.



Debian switching back to GNOME as the default desktop
-----------------------------------------------------



Joey Hess [shared](https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/tasksel/tasksel.git/commit/?id=dce99f5f8d84e4c885e6beb4cc1bb5bb1d9ee6d7)
why Debian is likely switching back to GNOME as the default
desktop environment, based on preliminary [results](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDesktop/Requalification/Jessie) which show GNOME
coming out ahead in the requalification. This change is also supported by accessibility
and to some extent systemd integration.



Contributing to Debian in other ways
------------------------------------



Vincent Sanders blogged about contributions to Debian and how, surprisingly,
they do not always need to be software related. He
[demonstrated](http://vincentsanders.blogspot.de/2014/10/it-is-bad-plan-that-admits-of-no.html) this with a
project to cool Debian down a bit. The project shows how doing some behind the
scenes work, which may seem small, really makes a major contribution to Debian,
and occasionally provides that excuse needed to buy more tools.



The Ada initiative and the Outreach Program For Women
-----------------------------------------------------



Matt Zimmerman [shared](http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2014/10/01/join-me-in-supporting-the-ada-initiative/)
an update on the [Ada Initiative](http://www.adainitiative.org/), a non-profit organisation
which has helped create positive change for women far past its inital goal of
supporting women working in open source communities. Matt asked for and
financially matched donations for the Initiative.




Nicolas Dandrimont [posted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/09/msg00004.html)
a call for projects and participants in the Outreach
Program for Women. The GNOME Foundation started the Free & Open Source Software
Outreach Program for Women in 2006; this year, Debian will participate and offer
(pending sponsorship) up to three internships. OPW allows applicants
to work on any kind of project to increase the number of women in FOSS. Interested parties
are encouraged to apply. More information about Debian's contribution and an overview is available on the
[Outreach Program for Women](https://wiki.debian.org/OutreachProgramForWomen) wiki page.



Who is 15?!
-----------



Today in [world domination news](http://blog.bofh.it/debian/id_452), we wish you a Happy WHOIS! 15 years ago
Marco d'Itri thought the process of acquiring WHOIS information should be
simpler and should not require hunting through multiple registries.
He authored a Debian version of [WHOIS](https://github.com/rfc1036/whois) to replace the BSD-derived
version that used to ship with Debian. Marco's version of WHOIS and his
continued work in the background over the years for a WHOIS that knows which
server to query for IP addresses and ASNs has a database that is often more up
to date than the official IANA database. Marco's WHOIS is now the default WHOIS
client on all Linux distributions.



Squeeze long term support reports
---------------------------------



RaphaÃ«l Hertzog [reported](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2014/09/30/my-debian-lts-report-for-september/)
on 11 hours of paid support work on Debian LTS. 23
commits were made to the security tracker consisting of patch reviews, uplinks,
and changes to [the
list of packages that require LTS updates](https://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/secure-testing/data/dla-needed.txt?view=co).
A fair amount of research goes into the effort
beyond just reviewing or triage. He detailed some of the efforts taken to ensure
quality and stay abreast of vulnerabilities.




Freexian's [second
report about Debian Long Term Support](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2014/10/15/freexians-second-report-about-debian-long-term-support/) showed that compared
to last month, we have gained five new sponsors and now provide almost
25% of a full-time position. 39 packages needed updates in Squeeze, which is nine
more than last month. Contributors paid by Freexian handled 11 updates
last month, which gives an approximate rate of three hours per update with CVE
triage included. Given that the list of sponsors is
almost exclusively comprised of European companies, readers are
asked what can be done to convince others to join
the effort.




[Holger
Levsen's September 2014 LTS report](http://layer-acht.org/thinking/blog/20141001-lts-september-2014/) relayed work on the Debian Security
Tracker which he is happy to announce looks good and professional. Eight bugs were
squashed, a backport of dgit was uploaded to wheezy-backports, and uploads to
squeeze-lts were made for apache2, nss, libplack-perl, icinga, libstrus1, and
wordpress.




Thorsten Alteholz [reported](http://blog.alteholz.eu/2014/10/my-debian-activities-in-september-2014/)
11 hours in September on Squeeze-LTS, uploading new
versions of eglibc, curl, php5, and fex. He also collaborated with
RaphaÃ«l Hertzog on a new version of python-django. In other areas Thorsten
uploaded a new version of [net-dns-fingerprint](https://packages.qa.debian.org/n/net-dns-fingerprint.html)
and worked in his role as FTP assistant with 312 packages accepted.



General Resolution: init system coupling
----------------------------------------



In February of 2014 the
[technical committee](https://www.debian.org/devel/tech-ctte)
selected [systemd as the default
init system](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/02/msg00005.html) for Debian. Since that selection there has been a multitude of
discussions on many mailing lists both for and against the change. Lucas
Nussbaum [posted](http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=845) a tentative summary of each of the proposed amendments
in the [init system coupling General Resolution vote](https://www.debian.org/vote/2014/vote_003.en.html)
that is to occur shortly.



Bits from the Debian Multimedia Maintainers
-------------------------------------------



Alessio Treglia posted [bits
from the Debian Multimedia Maintainers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/10/msg00005.html) regarding
Jessie. They have been very busy with codec updates, from libavcodec (which has
been updated to the latest upstream to provide for HEVC, Opus, Matroska, and
Apple ProRes) to libeburl128, libltc, libva, and LADI Session Handler for JACK
applications. Included is the LV2 Toolkit and a LADSPA plugin bundle. New
multimedia applications include Advene, Ardour3, dvdwizard, flowblade, Groove
Basin, and mpv, among others. As the overall goal is to improve quality, a few packages
were dropped, such as beast, plotmn, phat, and mplayer. The team invites
interested parties to join them on the
[pkg-multimedia-maintainers mailing list](mailto:pkg-multimedia-maintainers@lists.alioth.debian.org)
on [Alioth](https://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pkg-multimedia-maintainers)
or on the OFTC #debian-multimedia IRC channel.



Debian Quiz Game, help wanted!
------------------------------



Lucas Nussbaum revisited the [Debian Quiz Game](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2014/10/msg00002.html) based on the original TCP/IP
drinking game with 23 newly added questions. He asks for a few adopters to
assist with pushing the process forward. Readers can check the [current state](https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/debian-quiz.git/) of the quiz with
its posted answers on collab-maint.



Debian DebUtsav'14
------------------



On October 17-18 at the Amrita School of Engineering,
Debian-India held a Debian Festival: DebUtsav'14.
Despite some last-minute political turmoil, the event planners
persevered.




Pirate Praveen [wrote](http://www.j4v4m4n.in/2014/10/23/debutsav-14-at-amrita-a-rewarding-experience/)
of the excitement and enthusiasm of working with students
who were already familiar with FOSS and in seeing women participating in FOSS.
He also shared his insight into how DebUtsav came to be created and how
this event that marries a Mini-DebConf and FOSS conference can move forward
as a brand and serve as a blueprint for other organisations.




Shirish Agarwal [posted](https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/2014/10/23/debutsav-2014-experiences-day-0/)
sharing his experience and timeline of the planning processes that went into the location, hosting
facility, and media aspects of the event.




Balasankar C [blogged](http://balasankarc.in/tech/celebrating-deepavali-differently-debutsav-14/)
about the hackfest, the keynote from Krishnakant Mane, and some of the
sessions that took place during the event. The wrap-up comes with a nice
summary: An event full of FOSS, Fun, and Food.




R. Harish Navnit [described](http://harishnavnit.wordpress.com/2014/10/20/the-debutsav14-experience/)
how an email this April about the possibility of a Mini-DebConf in Amritapuri
led to an idea, collaboration across several teams, a guest speaker, and finally an event.



Other reports
-------------



As well as the LTS report mentioned above, RaphaÃ«l Hertzog's
[Free
Software Activities in September 2014](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2014/10/02/my-free-software-activities-in-september-2014/) included updating
Django 1.7 in experimental and pushing for its inclusion in unstable. He noted that
the pace of development on tracker.debian.org slowed down a bit, with only 30
new commits in the repository to close six bugs. RaphaÃ«l has also been
packaging for a new upstream version of Publican, and sponsoring new
uploads of dolibarr, tcpdf, and tryton-server.




Thomas Goirand shared a [detailed](http://thomas.goirand.fr/blog/?p=207) OpenStack report showing his activity for the
month of September 2014. He highlighted the work done in the background for the
packages Icehouse and Juno (in Sid/Experimental, with backports for Wheezy). His overview focuses on the
daily uploads, fixes, and collaboration with other Debian Developers and teams.
