SteamOS, a game oriented Debian derivative
------------------------------------------



[Valve Software](http://www.valvesoftware.com) has made
available images for
[SteamOS](http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamOS/),
a Debian derivative aimed at providing a gaming experience built for the big screen.
This gaming operating system is based on Debian 7 (codename Wheezy).
Installation instructions are available from the
[SteamOS website](http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/buildyourown).
[A dedicated page in
the Debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census/SteamOS) lists additional information about this Debian derivative.



Mini-DebConf in Phnom Penh
--------------------------



[FOSSASIA](http://fossasia.org) is inviting Debian contributors and
fans to Phnom Penh, Cambodia for a Mini-DebConf from February 28 to March 2, 2014.
After previous events in Vietnam and a successful
[Mini-DebConf 2010](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianVietnam/MiniDebConf2010)
in Ho Chi Minh City it is time to bring together some of the awesome Debian folks in the region
again and organise another Mini-DebConf: Phnom Penh 2014. The event
will be held at Norton University, the leading IT institution in
Cambodia, and will bring together a number of free software projects. Please
join us,
[add
your name to the wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianCambodia/MiniDebConf2014), and spread the word!



Mini-DebConf in Barcelona
-------------------------



[Debian Women](https://www.debian.org/women) is proud to
[announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2013/12/msg00011.html)
that
[a
Mini-DebConf](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianWomen/Projects/MiniDebconf-Women/2014) will be organised in Barcelona on 15-16 March 2014.
The idea behind the conference is not to talk about women in free
software, or women in Debian, but Debian subjects more inclusive for women.
Everybody is invited, but speakers are expected to be all people identifying
themselves as women.
Conference organisers are seeking proposals for papers, presentations,
discussion sessions, and tutorials.
If you have one or more proposals, send them to
proposals@bcn2014.mini.debconf.org.



Greens/EFA Group in the European Parliament to use Debian for email encryption
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[Rebecca
Harms](http://www.rebecca-harms.de/index.php/lesen/trustworthy-encryption-a-small-step-to-stop-the-pollution--32935), co-president of the Greens/EFA Group in the European Parliament, announced
[a
project to use trustworthy encryption](http://www.greens-efa.eu/software-procurement-11372.html) in cooperation and dialogue
with European Parliament IT services and Debian.
Recognising that we live in a digital environment polluted by pervasive surveillance,
she sees encrypted software as a small first step to
ensure nobody but the intended recipent of an email can read it. Greens/EFA will
use a selection of Free Software from Debian running on regular consumer laptops.
As Greens in the European Parliament we are very pleased
that we are supported by Debian [...], a community of programmers and developers
abiding to a [social contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract) to share and
maintain their common resource
which they call Free Software, she said.



An automatic list of Debian contributors
----------------------------------------



Enrico Zini [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/12/msg00009.html)
that a list of known Debian contributors is available at
<https://contributors.debian.org/>.
The list will never be fully comprehensive, but it will try to be the
best effort Debian can possibly make to credit everyone, Enrico said.
The list is created from [data sources](https://contributors.debian.org/sources/)
which can be added to take into account new types of contributions.
Please refer to Enrico's message for implementation details.



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Lucas Nussbaum sent his
[monthly
report of DPL activities for November 2013](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/12/msg00003.html).

[participation
of Debian](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/11/msg00070.html) in the
[Outreach Program for Women](http://gnome.org/opw/).
He also started a [discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/11/msg00455.html)
about the role of release goals, and a proposal to replace them with procedures
built on the existing recommended practices for mass bug filings.




Lucas also recently updated delegations for
[the Policy Editors](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/12/msg00004.html),
[the Debian Keyring Maintainers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/12/msg00005.html),

[the Debian System Administrators](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/01/msg00001.html).
He also officialised the existence and the powers of the Release Team
by
[publishing the first delegation](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/12/msg00007.html)
for this team.



Bits from the Release Team
--------------------------



Niels Thykier sent some
[bits
from the Release Team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/12/msg00008.html), with a precise timeline of events
that need to happen before the freeze for the next stable Debian release, Jessie,
which is scheduled for November 5 2014.
He also mentioned that the results from [piuparts](https://piuparts.debian.org/),
a tool to test installation, upgrade and removal of Debian packages, are now integrated
into Britney, the software taking care of the migration of packages from unstable to testing.



Interviews
----------


There have been
[DebianEdu interviews](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/tags/intervju/)

[Klaus Knopper](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Edu_interview__Klaus_Knopper.html),
who both describe, among other things, how they got involved in Debian Edu and their views about it.

----------



The third update of the stable distribution of Debian (codename Wheezy)
[was released on December 14](https://www.debian.org/News/2013/20131214).




Jakub Wilk [posted on his blog](http://jwilk.net/blog/20131225-udput)
a one-liner script, named Î¼dput, to efficiently replace dput or dput-ng
for package uploading on a flaky network connection.




Martin Zobel-Helas sent
[minutes
of the DSA Team Meeting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2014/01/msg00003.html), held on December 13, 2013.

[Debian Administrator's
handbook](https://debian-handbook.info/), prefaced by Lucas Nussbaum,
the current Debian Project Leader, and Stefano Zacchiroli, Debian Project
Leader from 2010 to 2013, is
[available](https://debian-handbook.info/2013/major-update-of-the-debian-administrators-handbook-for-debian-7-wheezy/)
for download from the website of the book, or as the
[debian-handbook](https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/debian-handbook)
on Debian systems running unstable.




Niels Thykier
[announced](http://nthykier.wordpress.com/2013/12/23/automated-reprocessing-of-packages-on-lintian-debian-org/)
that he has automated the reprocessing of packages in the Debian archive when
there is a new version of [Lintian](https://lintian.debian.org/), a
tool to find bugs and policy violations in packages. Reprocessing the whole
Debian archive with Lintian 2.5.20 is expected to take about 3 to 4 weeks.

Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [Bugs Search interface of the Ultimate Debian Database](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi), the upcoming release, Debian Jessie, is currently affected by 476 Release-Critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about 330 Release-Critical bugs remain to be solved for the release to happen.


There are also [more detailed statistics](http://richardhartmann.de/blog/posts/2013/12/27-Debian_Release_Critical_Bug_report_for_Week_52/) as well as some [hints on how to interpret](https://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats) these numbers.
