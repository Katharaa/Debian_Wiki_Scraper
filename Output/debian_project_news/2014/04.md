Debian Technical Committee chooses systemd
------------------------------------------



Don Armstrong
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/02/msg00005.html)
that the
[Technical Committee](https://www.debian.org/devel/tech-ctte), which was asked in
[bug #727708](https://bugs.debian.org/727708) to decide which init
system would be the default init system for Debian, had reached the decision
that for Linux architectures the default in Jessie should be systemd.
Additional discussions regarding the technical policy necessary for
implementing this decision are still ongoing and can be followed
on the
[debian-ctte](https://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte/)
mailing list.



Debian selected for Google Summer of Code 2014
----------------------------------------------



Debian has been
[selected
as a mentoring organisation](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/list/public/google/gsoc2014) for the
[Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2014](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014),
a program that allows post-secondary students aged
18 and older to earn a stipend writing code for free and open source software
projects during the summer.
Nicolas Dandrimont
[sent a call](https://bits.debian.org/2014/02/call-for-students-gsoc-2014.html)
for mentors and students to participate in this year's Summer of Code.
Mentors for prospective projects can submit proposals on the
[project ideas list](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2014/Projects).
Eligible students can take a look at the list of projects, engage in discussions
with mentors and prepare their applications.
People interested in this program are encouraged to come and chat with the
Debian GSoC team on the #debian-soc IRC channel on irc.oftc.net, or to send an
email to the
[SoC coordination mailing list](https://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/soc-coordination).



DebConf14 organising team needs your help to raise funds
--------------------------------------------------------



The DebConf team is well into the planning for
[DebConf14](https://debconf14.debconf.org/)
which will take place in Portland, Oregon, USA during 23â31 August 2014.
They are now contacting potential sponsors from all around the globe.
If you can think of interested organisations, please feel free to reach out to
them, and ask, or if you are not comfortable asking directly, to contact the
[sponsors-team](mailto:sponsors@debconf.org) with any leads.



Barcelona Debian Women mini-DebConf
-----------------------------------



MÃ²nica RamÃ­rez Arceda
[sent
a public invitation](https://bits.debian.org/2014/02/minidebconf-barcelona-announce.html) for the mini-DebConf in Barcelona on 15â16 March organised
by [Debian Women](https://www.debian.org/women).
The [schedule
of talks](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianWomen/Projects/MiniDebconf-Women/2014/Talks) is already available.
[Registration](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianWomen/Projects/MiniDebconf-Women/2014/Participants) of participants is recommended.
The organisers are still raising funds to cover the costs of running the
conference and to offer travel sponsorship to people who can't pay for it.
Please consider donating any amount you can to our
[crowd-funding campaign](https://freedomsponsors.org/core/issue/427/),
or [contact them](mailto:debian-miniconf@cpl.upc.edu)
if you would like to become a sponsor.
For more information, visit the
[website of the event](http://bcn2014.mini.debconf.org).



Debian France's new contributor game
------------------------------------



[Debian France](http://france.debian.net) is
[organising](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/02/msg00009.html)
a small GSoC-like operation to recruit new Debian contributors. It will be mainly of
interest for French-speaking candidates since the reward is a paperback copy of the
[French translation](http://raphaelhertzog.fr/livre/cahier-admin-debian/)
of the
[Debian Administrator's Handbook](https://debian-handbook.info).
Debian France is now actively looking for potential mentors to propose projects. The
scope of the projects is much smaller than a Google Summer of Code (from about
16 to 32 hours of work).
If you want to mentor such a project, submit your ideas
on the [dedicated
wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianFrance/NewContributorGame).
