ARM64 help wanted
-----------------



Wookey sent [a report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-arm/2014/05/msg00078.html) about the state of the ARM64 port.
Currently, the port has 2 buildds running, and over 4200 packages built.
The ARM64 porters are
asking for help and volunteers to assist with over 300 packages that need
small trivial updates. They also need assistance with bug filing, [wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/Arm64Port) updates,
and programming language porting.



edos.debian.net back as qa.debian.org/dose
------------------------------------------



Ralf Treinen [announced](https://lists.debian.org/20140522201040.GA4119@free.fr)
that the analysis of packages that could not be installed due to dependency issues,
carried out from 2006 onward under the name edos.debian.net, is back on a Debian project
machine as qa.debian.org/dose. This comes with some enhancements: the use of
[dose-debcheck](http://dose.gforge.inria.fr/doc/tools/debcheck-primer.html),
a multiarch-aware tool; improved explanations of non-installability; and a classification according to the duration of
non-installability (going back to April 5, 2014).



Bits from the Debian GNU/Hurd porters
-------------------------------------



Michael Banck sent some [bits
from the Debian GNU/Hurd porters](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/05/msg00006.html), retracing the evolution of the GNU/Hurd
port during the last two years. Since their
[last
message](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/02/msg00002.html), they have been working on several fronts:
whereas Debian Wheezy does not provide an official Hurd port,
last year they released a Wheezy-like version of
[Debian
GNU/Hurd sid](http://ftp.debian-ports.org/debian-cd/hurd-i386/current/), as qemu and Debian Installer images.
  

On the archive coverage front, more than 80% of the packages available
in the archive now build successfully for hurd-i386. The
stability and uptime of the Hurd autobuilder has been improved, and the
up-to-date package count for wanna-build statistics recently reached 98%.
  

As a result of last year's GSoC work by Justus Winter, the init system has
been switched to SysVinit. This goes together with numerous advances in the
upstream GNU/Hurd and GNU/Mach projects.
