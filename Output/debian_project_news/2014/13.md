Bits from the release team and Jessie's freeze
----------------------------------------------



Adam D. Barrat published
[some
release team news](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/09/msg00002.html). The window for new transitions closed on September
5, and ongoing transitions should be completed as quickly as possible. The final
architecture check was completed in mid-September, and the current agreed list
of architectures for Jessie is amd64, armel and armhf, i386,
kfreebsd-amd64 and kfreebsd-i386, mips, mipsel, powerpc and s390x. The final
decision for kFreeBSD ports, for which human resources is a concern, and arm64
and ppc64el ports, which made good progress and have strong support, is expected
in the very beginning of November.
The freeze for Jessie is scheduled for November 5. In order to get their
packages into Jessie before the freeze, maintainers of packages should take into
account the fact that starting from October 5, the migration delay for all
packages uploaded to unstable to enter Jessie will be 10 days.




On a related topic,
Lucas Nussbaum asks, Will the packages you rely on be part of Debian Jessie?,
with a helpful [series of steps](http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=837) you can use to be prepared.
Please also read the [Freeze Policy for Jessie](https://release.debian.org/jessie/freeze_policy.html) to ensure you are in fact ready,
prepared, and aware of the procedures taking place.



DebConf14: Talks, thoughts, comments and progress
-------------------------------------------------



The annual Debian developer meeting took place in Portland, Oregon, 23 to 31
August 2014. [DebConf14](https://debconf14.debconf.org/) attendees
participated in talks, discussions, workshops and programming sessions. Video
teams captured a lot of the main talks and discussions for streaming for
interactive attendees and for the [Debian video
archive](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/). Between the video, presentations, and handouts the coverage came
from the attendees in blogs, posts, and project updates of which a few
have been gathered for your reading over on the [DebConf blog](http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf14/wrap-up.dc).



DebConf15 dates are set, come and join us!
------------------------------------------



The dates for [DebConf15](https://debconf15.debconf.org) are set:
the conference will take place from 15 to 22 August 2015 in Heidelberg.
Members of the public are invited to the Opening Weekend, where a wide range
of content and events will be offered. DebConf will also be preceded by
DebCamp.




The DebConf15 team presented their conference plans in a full session at
DebConf14 (watch [the
video](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2014/debconf14/webm/DebConf15_in_Heidelberg.webm)), and provided an executive summary during the closing ceremony ([slides
available](http://media.debconf.org/dc15/pres/dc15_lightning_pres_at_dc14.pdf)).
People wanting to contribute to the organisation of DebConf15 are encouraged
to have a look at the [wiki
pages](https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf15/Germany), join the
organisational IRC channels, and subscribe to the mailing lists.




Announcements will also be made available on the
[DebConf blog](http://blog.debconf.org).



Help DebConf15 raise funds
--------------------------



The DebConf fundraising team [have
announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/09/msg00003.html) that they are now contacting potential sponsors from all around the
globe, with [a
brochure](http://media.debconf.org/dc15/fundraising/debconf15_sponsorship_brochure.pdf) that summarises DebConf and the available sponsoring benefits. If
you can think of interested organisations, please consider asking them to
sponsor. If you would prefer not to ask directly, please contact the
[fundraising team](mailto:sponsors@debconf.org) with any leads.



Discussions about OpenPGP
-------------------------



A certain number of interesting blog posts about cryptography were published
recently in the Debian community. Simon Josefsson advocated
on his blog
[the
case for short OpenPGP key validity periods](http://blog.josefsson.org/2014/08/26/the-case-for-short-openpgp-key-validity-periods/).
Bernhard R. Link posted [his
point of view about where expiry dates for cryptographic keys are useful, and where
they are not](http://blog.brlink.eu/index.html#i68).
Gunnar Wolf [summarised on his blog](http://gwolf.org/node/3950)
several cryptography-related discussions which occurred during
DebConf14. As a Debian keyring maintainer, he gave a presentation at DebConf together with
Daniel Kahn Gillmor and Jonathan McDowell
about the status of the Debian OpenPGP keyring, after which it was decided to
[remove
keys shorter than 2048Â bits from the Debian keyring by the end of the year](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/08/msg00015.html).
One month after this presentation, Gunnar posted on his blog [some nice graphs](http://gwolf.org/node/3951) about the evolution of the
Debian keyring. In the meantime, Clint Adams
[presented
some statistics about connectivity in the Debian keyring](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2014/09/msg00137.html), before and after
the DebConf14 key signing party.



Long Term Support (LTS) Reports
-------------------------------



Freexian's offer to bring together funding from multiple companies in order to
sponsor the work of multiple developers on [Debian LTS](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS) also required
paid contributors to provide a public monthly report of their paid work.
In July and August of this year Freexian sponsored
[Holger Levsen](http://layer-acht.org/thinking/blog/20140819-lts-july-2014/) and
[Thorsten
Alteholz](http://blog.alteholz.eu/2014/07/my-debian-activities-in-july-2014/), who have both reported on their progress in July.
While Freexian has not reached its minimal goal of
funding the equivalent of a half-time position which is reflected in the results, the
program has learned a few things such as that paid contributors handle almost 70%
of the updates, and counting only on volunteers would not have worked. It is
also worthy of note that quite a few companies that promised help have
not delivered on the promised help yet, though that should not distract from
the fact that this project wouldnât exist without the support of multiple
companies and organisations who did step up.




Raphael Hertzog posted an [August
update](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2014/09/02/my-free-software-activities-in-august-2014/) on his Free Software Activities.
Distro Tracker has Python 3 compatibility, and the full test suite passes with Python 3.4
and Django 1.6. [Help](https://tracker.debian.org/docs/contributing.html)
is still needed. Django 1.7 had patches applied for
[horizon](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=755651),
[django-restricted-resource](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=755607)
and [django-testscenarios](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=755661).
Raphael was also able to contribute towards the French translation for Dpkg.




Thorsten Alteholz posted an [August
update](http://blog.alteholz.eu/2014/08/my-debian-activities-in-august-2014/) on his current work on the FTP team, where he accepted over 237
packages, and on Squeeze LTS, with new security updates for several packages.



Cinnamon environment now available in testing
---------------------------------------------


Margarita Manterola [announced](https://lists.debian.org/CAP+fKSoksg-ZfQvUryx7fn9EF6OnpE-EW4FyUjMFcDau9T1kPg@mail.gmail.com)
that the Cinnamon environment is now available in testing. She gave instructions
for installing the packages, noting that there still are bugs that they
haven't found yet, so bug reports are welcomed. Contributions via the
pkg-cinnamon project on alioth are also encouraged.


Debian turns 21, and celebrates!
--------------------------------



On Saturday, August 16, Celebrations were held [around the world](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay/2014)
as our beloved Operating System turned [21 years old!](https://bits.debian.org/2014/08/21-birthday-debian.html)
The annual [Debian Day](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay)
gatherings hosted LAN parties, bug squashing, and of course cake!



Google Summer of Code
---------------------



Juliana Louback, via blog post, updated the status of [JSCommunicator](http://julianalouback.com/tech/2014/08/14/jscommunicator-2.0-is-live/)
which was part of Google's Summer of Code 2014. JSCommunicator is a SIP
communication tool developed in HTML and JavaScript. The code was designed
to make integration with a website or web app as simple as possible. Users
may check out the [live demo here](https://rtc.debian.org/).




Matthias Klumpp shared via blog post an [update to the Debian implementation of
AppStream](http://blog.tenstral.net/2014/08/appstreamdep-11-debian-progress.html), [DEP-11](https://wiki.debian.org/DEP-11), and the
work of his GSOC intern Abhishek Bhattacharjee's [DEP-11 generator](http://abhi11.github.io/jekyll/update/2014/08/15/DEP-11-Metadata-Generator/)
which pulls metadata from multiple sources and converts them into YAML, working towards
the larger possibility of a software centre. The generator will be a part of
the Debian Archive Kit used to manage Debian archives on the FTP servers.



Rebuild of Debian using Clang
-----------------------------



Sylvestre Ledru blogged about an updated [rebuild
of Debian using Clang](http://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/2014/09/11/rebuild-of-debian-using-clang-3-5). Clang 3.5.0 has been released, and has seen a [marked
decrease](http://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/media/blogs/sylvestre/evolution-clang-sept-2014.png?mtime=1410087335) in build failures
from 2,040 packages (9.5%) to 1,261 (5.7%). Upstream fixes started
with bugs such as [conflicting
types](https://clang.debian.net/status.php?version=3.5.0&key=CONFLICTING_TYPE) and [changes
of the default constructor](https://clang.debian.net/status.php?version=3.5.0&key=DEFAULT_CONSTRUCTOR),
then moved to a different parallel approach of focusing on improving GCC
compatibility with a warning category instead of errors.



Other news
----------



Laura Arjona [posted](http://larjona.wordpress.com/2014/09/20/happy-software-freedom-day/)
about [Software Freedom Day](http://softwarefreedomday.org/) with information on Debian
Derivatives, F-Droid, Jabber/XMPP, and the upcoming DebConf15.




Wookey sent a
[detailed
report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/08/msg00013.html) of the bootstrap/crossbuild sprint, which took place in Paris, in mid-August.
In this report, he presents various problems with early bootstrapping,
a discussion of partial archives for different ISAs, the state of the effort to get cross-compilers into
Jessie, cross compile support in source packages, bootstrap and crossbuild
quality insurance, build profiles, and the tools
[rebootstrap](https://wiki.debian.org/HelmutGrohne/rebootstrap) and
[botch](https://gitorious.org/debian-bootstrap/botch).




Lior Kaplan wrote an article about
[the
importance of close integration between distribution and upstream](http://liorkaplan.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/the-importance-of-close-integration-between-distribution-and-upstream/), using
as an example the maintenance of PHP in Debian and how it had a positive effect
on the quality of the upstream release of the 5.6.0 version.



Interviews
----------



Stefano Zacchiroli has [shared](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2014/09/interview_for_the_gnu_linux_setup/)

Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [Bugs Search interface of the Ultimate Debian Database](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi), the upcoming release, Debian jessie, is currently affected by 408 Release-Critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about 360 Release-Critical bugs remain to be solved for the release to happen.


There are also [more detailed statistics](http://richardhartmann.de/blog/posts/2014/09/26-Debian_Release_Critical_Bug_report_for_Week_39/) as well as some [hints on how to interpret](https://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats) these numbers.
