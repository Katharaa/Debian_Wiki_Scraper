Call for projects and mentors for Debian GSoC 2014
--------------------------------------------------



Nicolas Dandrimont asked all Debian contributors for
[projects
and mentors](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/02/msg00001.html)
to help Debian participate in the tenth year of the
[Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/).
Everyone (member of the Debian project or not, student or not) is welcome to
submit their ideas, and to try and find people willing to mentor the projects,
explained Nicolas in his mail.
If you have an idea, please publish it on the
[wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2014/Projects),
and send an email to the
[coordination mailing list](mailto:soc-coordination@lists.alioth.debian.org).
You can also contact Nicolas and the other GSoC administrators for Debian on
their mailing list or on their IRC channel, #debian-soc on irc.debian.org.



Bits from the Release Team
--------------------------



Niels Thykier sent some
[bits
from the Release Team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/01/msg00008.html).
The Release Team recently reviewed the status of the architectures in sid,
and decided that
[IA64
should be removed from testing](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/01/msg00009.html), and
[will
soon be removed from unstable and experimental](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2014/02/msg00035.html).
Niels also indicated in his message that auto-removal from testing
of non-leaf RC-buggy packages has been suspended until there is a way to
properly notify the maintainers of reverse-dependencies that the removal will occur.
In the meantime, thanks to the work of Ivo De Decker and Paul Wise,
the [Package Tracking Service](https://packages.qa.debian.org/)
will now display a warning for packages that are about to be
auto-removed from testing. The auto-removals are also listed,
[thanks
to Lucas Nussbaum](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2014/01/msg00574.html),
on the [Debian Maintainer Dashboard](https://udd.debian.org/dmd/)
and by the [how-can-i-help](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/how-can-i-help)
package.



Reports from recent Debian Sprints
----------------------------------



Antonio Terceiro
[sent a report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2014/02/msg00028.html)
of the
[Debian Ruby Sprint](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Ruby/Meeting/Paris2014),
held in Paris on January 15â17,
as a satellite event of the
[Paris Mini-DebConf](http://france.debian.net/events/minidebconf2014/).
He explained in his message the efforts of the
team regarding the removal of the now deprecated 1.8 version of the Ruby interpreter, and the goals
of the Ruby team for Jessie.




The Debian Med team organised their
[fourth sprint in Aberdeen](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMed/Meeting/Aberdeen2014)
from January 31 until February 2. Several members of the team posted
[reports](https://lists.debian.org/debian-sprints/2014/02/msg00000.html)
[of](https://lists.debian.org/debian-sprints/2014/02/msg00001.html)
[their](https://lists.debian.org/debian-sprints/2014/02/msg00002.html)
[activities](https://lists.debian.org/debian-sprints/2014/02/msg00003.html)
during the sprint, including packaging, bug fixing, and presentations of
software.




The Ruby Team thanks IRILL for hosting the meeting, and both teams thank the
generous Debian sponsors for funding the expenses required for the sprints.
