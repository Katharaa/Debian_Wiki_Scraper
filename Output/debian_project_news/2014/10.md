A logo for DebConf15
--------------------



[DebConf15](https://debconf15.debconf.org/), which will be held
in Heidelberg, Germany, ran a logo
competition in May. After the votes were tallied, they are pleased to
[announce](http://lists.debconf.org/lurker/message/20140602.042106.6f42799c.en.html)
Valessio Brito as the winner with his submitted design.
The winning design (with ongoing work on optimisation for print, web, etc.) can be found on the
[DebConf15 artwork page](https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf15/Artwork).



Hello, MATE!
------------



Mike Gabriel from the MATE package team [announced](https://lists.debian.org/20140603113844.Horde.zKYk0_iwPq7s6PKFDuIMLg7@mail.das-netzwerkteam.de)
that the MATE 1.8 desktop environment has fully arrived in Debian. MATE is a
fork of what was previously the GNOME v2 desktop environment. It is available
in unstable, testing, and wheezy-backports. Feel free to use and test via the
meta-packages mate-desktop-environment and mate-desktop-environment-extras.



The Debian Continuous Integration project
-----------------------------------------



Antonio Terceiro wrote on his [blog](http://softwarelivre.org/terceiro/blog/an-introduction-to-the-debian-continuous-integration-project)
about how new versions of packages can potentially break some functionality in other
packages, and what can be done about this. He detailed the Debian Continuous
Integration project which checks inter-package dependencies across the entire
Debian archive. The origins of the project go back to the introduction of
the [autopkgtest tool](https://packages.debian.org/autopkgtest),
which tests packages in their installed form, and was later adopted as the
[DEP-8 standard](https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/autopkgtest/autopkgtest.git/plain/doc/README.package-tests.rst).
The continuous integration tool, called
[debci](https://packages.debian.org/debci), is run against the entire archive for
packages that declare a test suite using the DEP-8 format. Debian CI runs at most four tests per day
and publishes its results at [ci.debian.net](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2014/10/ci.debian.net) every
hour along with a global status. With the introduction of Debian CI earlier
 this year there has been a rise in the number of packages with test suites.
 Maintainers are encouraged to use test suites in their packages and read the
 [documentation](http://ci.debian.net/doc/) about the system.
