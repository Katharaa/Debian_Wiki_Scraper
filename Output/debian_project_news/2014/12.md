Debian Day 2014
---------------



[Debian Day](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay)
is celebrated on August 16 of each year and
[this year](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay/2014)
it falls on a Saturday. So far it looks as if sixteen towns or cities in six countries
will be celebrating Debian Day in 2014.
If you have a celebration planned,
please register on the wiki and add a page about it. If you don't yet have one
planned, why not join us in celebrating Debian?



Help needed with ejabberd testing
---------------------------------



If you are a user of the ejabberd package (an XMPP server), Philipp Huebner is
[looking](https://lists.debian.org/53BECF23.2040706@debian.org)
for help testing the latest version which he recently uploaded.



2014-Debian Developers per Country
----------------------------------



Christian Perrier's [annual report](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2014/07/29#devel-countries-201308)
on the number of Debian Developers per Country has been updated for 2014.
The report includes data for each year from 2009 to the present.



OpenAmbit is now in unstable
----------------------------



As reported by Christian Perrier in a [weblog entry](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2014/07/18#openambit),
OpenAmbit, a project which is developing open software for the Suunto Ambit
sports watch, is now in unstable.



Debian arm64 port at 85%
------------------------



Wookey posted to the Debian ARM list [declaring
the arm64 port open and making a request for help](https://lists.debian.org/debian-arm/2014/08/msg00096.html). The port is 84.5% built
with 180 packages currently queued, which places the overall project extremely
close to the 85% needed for [qualification](https://ftp-master.debian.org/archive-criteria.html).
There are many packages not yet built from Debian sources which need assistance
towards the goal of bootstrapping arm64 in time for Jessie. A list of the
[arm64 port
blocking packages](https://people.debian.org/~wookey/bootstrap/blockerlist) is generated once a day.



First steps towards source-only uploads
---------------------------------------



As a first step towards mandatory source-only uploads, Ansgar Burchardt
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/08/msg00002.html)
that source-only uploads into the Debian archive are now accepted, under some
conditions: in particular, the source packages must be already present in the
archive and must not create new binary packages, and only architecture specific
binary packages can be dropped from the list of files upload.



Check the schedule for DebConf14
--------------------------------



DebConf, the annual conference of the Debian project, will be held this year
in Portland, Oregon, USA, from August 23 to August 31. For people who cannot
attend the conference, DebConf talks will be broadcast live on the Internet
where possible, and videos of the talks will be published on the web along
with the presentation slides. Please check the
[full schedule](https://summit.debconf.org/debconf14/) on the
[website](https://debconf14.debconf.org/) of the DebConf14 conference.



Interviews
----------


There has been
[a DebianEdu interview](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/tags/intervju/)
with
[Bernd Zeitzen](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Edu_interview__Bernd_Zeitzen.html) (in English)
who describes, among other things, how he got involved in Debian Edu and his views about it.

DebConf.
