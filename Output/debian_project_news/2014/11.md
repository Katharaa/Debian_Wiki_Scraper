Google Summer of Code updates
-----------------------------



S.M. Floris gives an status update to [Muon package integration with apt-listbugs](http://web2unu.ro/?p=51):
apt-listbugs will warn users when installing packages if those packages have
serious, grave, or critical bugs. The muon package is available in the
[Git repository for the muon package on Alioth](https://salsa.debian.org/qt-kde-team/kde-extras/muon)
under the gsoc-floris-2014 branch.
Ian S. Donnelly takes us through his 4 week experience and process of
implementing a Three-Way merge algorithm for Elektra KeySets in C++ towards the
[kdb merge tool](http://community.libelektra.org/wp/?author=2).
Andrew Schurman shares his latest update on the [Java Project
Dependency Builder](https://lists.debian.org/debian-java/2014/06/msg00088.html) which aims to check all of the dependencies in a project
to assure that the sources are actually "free".



The first set of talks for DebConf14 have been accepted!
--------------------------------------------------------


* [Outsourcing your webapp maintenance to Debian](https://summit.debconf.org/debconf14/meeting/16/outsourcing-your-webapp-maintenance-to-debian/)
We moved away from statically-linked C/C++ programs a long time ago and now
live in a nicely-packaged shared library world. This talk will examine the
decision that the Libravatar project made to outsource much of its maintenance
burden to Debian by using system packages for almost everything.
* [bugs.debian.org â Database Ho!](https://summit.debconf.org/debconf14/meeting/15/bugsdebianorg-database-ho/)
Brief overview of the current state of the BTS, new features, and new
developments in the ongoing onslaught of bugs.
* [use Perl; # Annual meeting of the Debian Perl Group](https://summit.debconf.org/debconf14/meeting/12/use-perl-annual-meeting-of-the-debian-perl-group/)
The pkg-perl team will again take the opportunity to meet in person for
discussing current topics and planning future work.
* [Status of the Debian OpenPGP keyring](https://summit.debconf.org/debconf14/meeting/11/status-of-the-debian-openpgp-keyring/)
Introduce keyring-maint's work processes and policies to get them better
understood by the overall Debian community.
* [Seeing Debian through a functional lens](https://summit.debconf.org/debconf14/meeting/9/seeing-debian-through-a-functional-lens/)
Using Nix's functional package management as inspiration, let's look at Debian
from a functional programming perspective.
* [Debsources: powering sources.debian.net](https://summit.debconf.org/debconf14/meeting/7/debsources-powering-sourcesdebiannet/)
[Debsources](http://sources.debian.net) provides web access to the
entire historical Debian source code from archives to current and
experimental. Users can browse or search source packages online through the
web instance or use Debsources via its [API](http://sources.debian.net/doc/api/)
* [A glimpse into a systemd future](https://summit.debconf.org/debconf14/meeting/5/a-glimpse-into-a-systemd-future/)
Technologies covered include journald, systemd-networkd, socket activation,
timer units, containers, and systemd user sessions. Goals include reducing boot
time, reducing duplicate configuration, improving system manageability,
improving battery life, and unifying graphical session startup.
* [New Network Interface Manager for Debian: ifupdown2](https://summit.debconf.org/debconf14/meeting/6/new-network-interface-manager-for-debian-ifupdown2/)
A proposal for ifupdown2, a new implementation of debian ifupdown package written in python.


These are just the first accepted talks and we are still accepting talks about
Debian-related ideas, proposals, and stories. Details on
[how to submit your own talk](https://debconf14.debconf.org/talks.xhtml)
are available on the events page.



Debian is moving (back) to GLIBC
--------------------------------



Five years ago Debian moved from using GLIBC to the EGLIBC fork as the standard
C library. Now that course of action is being reversed and [Debian is switching
back to GLIBC](http://blog.aurel32.net/175) due to the demise of the EGLIBC project and [the dissolution of
the GLIBC steering committee](https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2012-03/msg01038.html). With the GLIBC committee gone, GLIBC became
open for peer review, shared repositories, removal of the ports/ directories,
 and has had most of the important EGLIBC features merged back into it. The
new glibc package is available in experimental.



Other news
----------



The HackFest of the [Tails (the
amnesic incognito live system)](https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html) project will take place on JulyÂ 5-6 in
Paris, hosted by IRILL. The [Tails HackFest](https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/HackFest_2014_Paris/)
will bring together anyone interested in making Tails more usable and more
secure. If you want to learn about the challenges faced by Tails, and how
you can be part of the solution, this open event will be an intense mix of
teaching, drawing, coding, sharing, learning and celebrating, supported by
Debian, IRILL, Mozilla and the Tor project.
