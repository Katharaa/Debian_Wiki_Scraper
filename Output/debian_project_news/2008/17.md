Release Update
--------------


Luk Claes
[reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/12/msg00006.html)
about the state of the upcoming stable release Debian GNU/Linux 5.0
Lenny. While there are still a lot of release critical bugs open, he
explained that there is only a short list of bugs that must
absolutely be fixed for Lenny. At the moment the most important blocking
issue is the missing second release candidate for the debian-installer, which
is still [being worked
on](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2008/12/msg00209.html). Christian Perrier
[pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2008/12/msg00228.html), that the best way to help the debian-installer team is to test the so
called daily builds of the installation images, which are available from
the [debian-installer
website](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/).


The release could also be affected by the outcome of the recently [started vote](https://www.debian.org/vote/2008/vote_003) on the General
Resolution titled Lenny and resolving DFSG violations. The vote has
been discussed controversially on the debian-vote mailing list; for the full
discussion please refer to the mailing list
[archives](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote).


In related news, Peter Palfrader
[wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-hppa/2008/12/msg00000.html)
whether the PA-RISC architecture (also known as "HPPA") is currently fit to be
released with Lenny, since Debian's own HPPA infrastructure is in very bad
shape. When several people offered their private HPPA hardware, Martin
Zobel-Helas [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2008/12/msg00381.html), that the real problem is not missing hardware, but a kernel related
issue, which needs to be fixed. Helge Deller [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-hppa/2008/12/msg00009.html) on
progress regarding that issue, but it is not yet fixed completely.


General Resolution: Project membership procedures
-------------------------------------------------


A recently finished
[General Resolution](https://www.debian.org/vote/2008/vote_002) was
concerned with the proposal by Debian Account Manager JÃ¶rg Jaspert about [Debian
membership](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/10/msg00005.html) changes, especially in regard to non technical /
package-oriented contributions to the project. Lucas Nussbaum
[blogged about](http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=322) the
different options, and the general meaning of this General Resolution. In the
end, the second option, Invite the DAM to further discuss until vote or
consensus, leading to a new proposal, won.


Better backports.org Support
----------------------------



Gerfried Fuchs
[announced](http://alfie.ist.org/blog/debian/backports-support.en.html)
two services that facilitate the tracking of what's going on on
[backports.org](http://www.backports.org), an unofficial service
offering updated packages for the current stable release. One of the new
services is a
[security
tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/status/release/stable-backports), the other one is a version [comparison](http://backports.deb.at/) between the
different Debian releases and the package versions available on backports.org.


Future of GTK 1.2
-----------------


Since version 1.2 of the
[GTK tool kit](https://packages.debian.org/src:gtk+1.2) has been
orphaned by its upstream developers as well as its Debian maintainers for quite
some time and has also collected a number of
[bugs](https://bugs.debian.org/src:gtk+1.2) in the meantime, it is
scheduled to be removed during the releasing cycle for Debian Squeeze,
the version following Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 Lenny. However, several
packages are still depending on that library. Josselin Mouette
[created](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/12/msg00294.html) a
list of the concerned packages and tried to find alternative applications.


Morten Kjeldgaard
[argued](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/12/msg00304.html),
that there are still a lot of useful (scientific) applications depending on
GTK+ 1.2, which are still in use. Charles Plessy
[explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/12/msg00355.html),
that with nobody taking care of GTK+ 1.2, there is no other choice but to port
these applications to newer versions of that tool kit, which has worked very
well for other examples.


Bug Squashing Party held at MIT
-------------------------------


Greg Price
[reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/12/msg00513.html)
about a Bug Squashing Party which was held last Sunday and was hosted by the
student computing group of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 15 people
contributed to resolutions or partial resolutions of 11 RC bugs, lowering the
number of release critical bugs to 105. Greg also pointed to
[some scripts](http://debathena.mit.edu/debian-bts/) they found useful
to create lists of relevant bugs.


Other news
----------


The 11th issue of the
[miscellaneous
news for developers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/12/msg00001.html) has been released and covers the following topics:


* CD/DVD images for Lenny
* License AGPL v3.0 is suitable for main
* Building CD/DVD images made easier
* Mono 2.0 transition in progress
* SOAP interface to the PTS
* Tracking GCC 4.4 related build errors
* Mirror of git repositories on Alioth


Charles Plessy
[wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/12/msg00108.html)
if it would help the release to file properly justified 'requests for removal'
bugs for packages that have a low [popularity
contest value](https://popcon.debian.org), more or less inactive maintainers and generally seem to be
in bad shape, maybe even orphaned upstream-wise. Christian Perrier's
[answer](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/12/msg00113.html)
affirmed this idea.


JÃ¶rg Jaspert [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/12/msg00003.html)
that Frank Lichtenheld has been added to the FTP team.


Junichi Uekawa [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/12/msg00256.html)
an upcoming meeting taking place in [Tokyo,
Japan](https://tokyodebian.alioth.debian.org/2008-12.html).


Charles Plessy [proposed
a peer review system](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/12/msg00442.html) for the copyright files of Debian packages.


New Maintainer
--------------


One applicant has been [accepted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/12/msg00049.html)
as Debian Maintainer since the prior issue of the Debian Project News.  

Please welcome Eugene V. Lyubimkin into our project!


Release-critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [unofficial
RC-bugs count](http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php), the upcoming release Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 Lenny is
currently affected by 112 release critical bugs. 39 of them have already been
fixed in Debian's unstable branch. Of the remaining 73 release critical bugs,
30 already have a patch (which might need testing) and 7 are marked as pending.


Ignoring these bugs as well as release critical bugs for packages in contrib or
non-free, 34 release critical bugs remain to be solved for the release to
happen.
