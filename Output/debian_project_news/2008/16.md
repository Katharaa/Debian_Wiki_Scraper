Debian Project News - December 2nd, 2008
========================================



Welcome to this year's 16th issue of DPN, the newsletter for the Debian
community. Topics covered in this issue include:


* Etch-and-a-half installation images updated
* GNU Affero General Public License suitable for Debian main
* Security Teams Meeting in Essen
* ... and much more.


**Etch-and-a-half installation images updated**


As a result of the release of the first release candidate for Lenny of
Debian Installer (D-I RC1) on November 12th, the installer images for
[Etch-and-a-half](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/etchnhalf) have
also been updated. A consequence of this update is that during installation of
Etch-and-a-half using the currently available images, a newer kernel version
(2.6.26) will be used. However, the kernel used for the installed system
remains unchanged at version 2.6.24. In some cases this can mean that hardware
which is supported during the installation does not work after the reboot into
the installed system because support for it was added after the 2.6.24
version.  
  

Old Etch-and-a-half businesscard and netinst CD images remain usable. Old
netboot images are no longer usable and will need to be replaced with a current
image. The
[Etch-and-a-half
Debian Installer web page](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/debian-installer/etchnhalf) has links to the new images and to the release
announcements which give an overview of changes in the installation system. The
Debian Installer team is currently preparing the second release candidate (RC2)
of the Lenny installer, which will again result in an update of the installer
images for Etch-and-a-half. The kernel version used during installation will
remain at 2.6.26.


**GNU Affero General Public License suitable for Debian "main"**


JÃ¶rg Jaspert, representing the FTP Archives team, has released a
[position
statement](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2008/11/msg00097.html) about the inclusion in main of works licensed under
[GNU Affero General
Public License version 3](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) (AGPLv3). In short, the statement says that such
works are suitable for Debian/main, even though the AGPL has an additional
clause when compared to the [GNU General Public
License](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) (GPLv3). The clause in question requires software to offer the
source code to a user when interacting with it remotely through a computer
network.


**Security Teams Meeting in Essen**


Martin 'Joey' Schulze [reports](http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200811301247) on the
Debian Security meeting which took place 28-30 November 2008 in Essen, Germany.
Members of both the stable and the testing security teams attended as did the
developers who are currently working on security updates for the backports
archive.


The attendees discussed issues with regard to future security work in the
Debian project and for the Debian distribution. Specific topics were
cooperation between the different teams (both in terms of work as well as in
terms of archive management), as well as long term support for Debian GNU/Linux
installations which cannot support an upgrade every two years (such as large
clusters of Debian GNU/Linux systems). Notes taken during the meeting will be
sent to the [debian-devel-announce
mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce) and summarized in the [Debian Project News](https://www.debian.org/News/project/).


**New Stable SuiteTelecentro 2.0**


The new stable version of [SuiteTelecentro](http://sourceforge.net/projects/suitetelecentro) is now
available for download from Sourceforge. SuiteTelecentro is a customisation of Debian and is built at the Free Software
Laboratory of the IT Board of Banco do Brasil, the largest and oldest public bank in Brazil.


As [already
covered](http://times.debian.net/?category=success-stories#1242) at [Debian Times](http://times.debian.net),
SuiteTelecentro is a GNU/Linux solution which allows the use of low performance
CPU and memory computers as affordable thin clients at telecentres for the
poor. Over 4 million users now have affordable access to an Internet enabled
computer thanks to this Free Software project.


SuiteTelecentro is based on Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 (Etch) and LTSP 4.2. The new 2.0 version features
easy installation, uses the GNOME graphical environment and includes: the OpenOffice.org suite, MySQL,
PHP, Apache, MediaWiki and the Ocara telecentre management software.


**Dependency based boot sequencing release goal completed**


Petter Reinholdtsen [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/11/msg00007.html)
that the release goal of supporting a dependency based boot sequence has been
completed. This allows system services to be started in an order which is
calculated from their dependencies on each other instead of a hardcoded order.


He adds that 99.8% of all packages in unstable now have the necessary
dependency information, with only 2 packages missing them. However, more
testers are needed to identify problems with currently untested combinations of
packages.


**Debian bugs #600000 and #1000000 contest**


Christian Perrier announced that as the [bug #500000](https://bugs.debian.org/500000) mark was turned on
September 24th 2008, Debian developers and contributors need a new challenge.
So a small contest has been set up again. The principle is very simple:
participants should place a bet (one per person) about the day bugs #600000 and #1000000
will be reported. The winners will be the persons placing their bets
as close as possible to the real moment bugs #600000 and #1000000 are
reported.


The [bet page](https://wiki.debian.org/600000thBugContest) is
hosted in the Debian wiki. It will be closed on December 31st, 2008. Bets will
be kept statically until bug #600000 is reported. Then the page will be
reopened with a new list of bets for bug #1000000. Thus, there will be four
sets of bets for bug #1000000 with even more suspense and fun.


**Inter-distribution collaboration for maintaining games**


Initiated by members of the merged Debian and Ubuntu games teams and Hans de
Goede from Fedora, a [mailing list](http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/games)
[was
created](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/games/2008-November/000006.html) to foster collaboration between operating systems for the
maintenance of games. The goal is to share and review patches that the
upstream project is slow or unwilling to accept, or to take over as the new
upstream for software in cases where the original upstream has died.


At this time, members of Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora, Fink, FreeBSD, Gentoo,
NetBSD, OpenSolaris, PC-BSD, Slackbuilds, SUSE and Yellow Dog Linux are on this
list as well as GNOME and KDE members.


**Call for talks for the Debian Developers' room at FOSDEM**


Wouter Verhelst [called
for talks](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/12/msg00000.html) for the Debian Developers' room at the upcoming Free and Open
Source Developers European Meeting (FOSDEM): a yearly community meeting that
takes place at the universitÃ© libre de Bruxelles in Brussels, Belgium and which
concentrates on bringing developers of Free Software together. As during
previous events, Debian has the opportunity to hold its own one and a half day
conference sub-track.


**When to do non-maintainer uploads?**


A recent non-maintainer upload of the
[php5 package](https://packages.qa.debian.org/php5) caused
[some
discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/11/msg00643.html) about how and when non-maintainer uploads should be done. While
fixing release critical bugs is indeed a very important topic (especially for
long standing bugs without action from the maintainer), release team member
Steve Langasek
[reminded](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/11/msg00666.html)
that developers should still inform the maintainers about any plans to perform
a NMU, while Thomas Viehmann
[reminded
maintainers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/12/msg00012.html) that they should fix, or at least comment on, release critical
bugs within two weeks.


**Popular packages in Ubuntu that are not in Debian main**


Petter Reinholdtsen did a
[survey](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/11/msg00659.html) on
the question of which popular Ubuntu packages are not included in Debian/main
and why. In order to determine the packages' popularity, Petter used their
popcon ratings. He ended up with a list of 152 popular Ubuntu packages which
are currently not in Debian/main, a number he considered surprisingly low.


Many of these packages are not in Debian due to different package structure or
other differences between Debian and Ubuntu, while others are already available
in contrib or non-free. Of the remaining packages
many are multimedia related. Petter thinks it would
be very nice to have these packages available in Debian and wants to encourage
their packaging.


In related news James Westby did a
[survey](http://jameswestby.net/weblog/ubuntu/04-revu.html) on the
quality of the Ubuntu packages which are not included in Debian using their
records in the Ubuntu bug tracking system.


**Developer News wanted**


RaphaÃ«l Hertzog, the author of the Misc Developer News
[asks](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/12/msg00014.html)
developers to (regularly)
[share](https://wiki.debian.org/DeveloperNews) short news about their
work and plans so they can be published in the Misc Developer News. Possible
news covers everything which is related to Debian development and not worth a
dedicated mail to debian-devel-announce. The news is published whenever five
news stories have come together. RaphaÃ«l points out that the Misc Developer
News can also be used to post calls for help.


**Need for an unofficial public community repository?**


The [rejection](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/11/msg00641.html)
from the queue for some new packages to be added to Debian by the ftp-masters
caused some discussion about the need of a
[repository for](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/11/msg00603.html)
[unofficial
packages](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/11/msg00607.html) not meeting Debian's standards or being otherwise unsupported.
Holger Levsen [pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/11/msg00604.html)
to [debian-unofficial.org](http://debian-unofficial.org), which
isn't [flawless](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/11/msg00605.html).
This caused Holger to think about a
[solution](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/11/msg00606.html)
inside of [debian-community.org](http://debian-community.org). The
proposal to [use](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/11/msg00612.html) [apt-get.org](http://apt-get.org) has been
[criticised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/11/msg00633.html)
as well.


**New maintainer**


One applicant has been
[accepted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/11/msg00071.html)
as Debian Maintainer since the prior issue of the Debian Project News. Please
welcome JÃ¶rg Sommer into our project!


**Bits from the buildd world**


Adeodato SimÃ³ sent
[bits
from buildd world](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/11/msg00006.html). Buildds are a part of Debian's infrastructure,
organising which automated build system (build daemon) is building which
package for which architecture. Beside some personnel changes, he also explains
the proper ways to contact the buildd team, as well as where the source code of
the buildd infrastructure is maintained.


**Release critical bug stats for the upcoming release**


According to the [unofficial
RC-bugs count](http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php), the upcoming release Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 Lenny is
currently affected by 118 release critical bugs. 43 of them have already been
fixed in Debian's unstable branch. Of the remaining 75 release critical
bugs, 33 already have a patch (which might need testing) and 5 are marked as
pending.


Ignoring these bugs as well as release critical bugs for packages in contrib
or non-free, 36 release critical bugs remain to be solved for the release to
happen.


**Important Debian Security Advisories**


Debian's Security Team recently released advisories for these packages (among others):
[python2.4](https://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1667),
[xulrunner](https://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1669),
[iceweasel](https://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1671),
[wireshark](https://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1673) and
[phpmyadmin](https://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1675).
Please read them carefully and take the proper measures.


Please note that these are only a selection of the more important security
advisories of the last two weeks. If you need to be kept up to date about
