Debian Project News - November 3rd, 2008
========================================



Welcome to this year's 14th issue of DPN, the newsletter for the Debian
community.  

Some of the topics covered in this issue include:


* Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 updated
* Debian membership
* First Lenny Bug Sprint finished successfully


**Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 updated**


The Debian project is pleased to announce the fifth update of its stable distribution
Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 (codename Etch). This update mainly corrects security
problems in the stable release, along with a few adjustments to serious problems.
Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have to update many
packages and most updates from security.debian.org are included in this update.
New CD and DVD images containing updated packages are available at the regular locations.


Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the aptitude (or apt-get)
package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to one of Debian's many FTP or
HTTP mirrors. A comprehensive list of mirrors is available [online](https://www.debian.org/mirror/list).


More information is available in the [press release](https://www.debian.org/News/2008/20081023).


**Debian membership**


After talking to several of the groups involved, JÃ¶rg Jaspert
[proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/10/msg00005.html) changes in the way
Debian membership is handled. The motivation for these changes is to make it possible for people
who contribute to Debian without maintaining packages (such as translators or documentation writers)
to become members of the project. He later [wrote](http://blog.ganneff.de/blog/2008/10/24/developer-status.html)
some comments additional to his proposal. However due to the scope of the envisioned changes, several developers
proposed to [stop these changes until](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2008/10/msg00193.html)
they have been decided upon via a general resolution, while Peter Palfrader
[asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2008/10/msg00266.html) to be allowed to continue trying to solve
this problem.


Lars Wirzenius and others would like to see the whole
[membership system rethought](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/10/msg00145.html), not only the process
by which membership is granted. Lars proposed that membership must be periodically renewed, while
People should be allowed to join Debian when there is reasonably widespread consensus that they
agree with the project's goals, are committed to working on those goals, and are trustworthy.


Martin Krafft [argued](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/10/msg00061.html) that instead of introducing
different classes of membership Debian should instead define different privileges and criteria for how to obtain
them. Since these privileges already exist it would be easier to define the criteria instead of mapping the
privileges to classes.


**First Lenny Bug Sprint finished successfully**


To help clean up release critical bug reports, especially longstanding ones,
Josselin Mouette [initiated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/10/msg00004.html)
the first Bug Sprint. In this competition, Debian Developers and other interested people volunteered
to try to fix their assigned release-critical bugs in a five day period. The winners in this competition
would get cookies.


Josselin later added that 27 players [joined](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/10/msg00636.html)
the bug sprint and posted [the results](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/11/msg00046.html).
(He already sent a more detailed [draft ealier](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/10/msg00875.html)).
All in all, he was very satisfied with the results. Stefano Zacchiroli
[proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/10/msg00887.html) repeating this kind of event.


**Firmware in Lenny and how to deal with DFSG-violating packages**


Ben Finney [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/10/msg00368.html) about several release-critical
bugs getting the lenny-ignore tag, which specifies that these bugs are not considered release critical for the upcoming
release of Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 Lenny. Release Manager Marc Brockschmidt
[explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/10/msg00369.html) that In all of the bugs I recently tagged,
the DFSG violation is usually a formal problem, something that other
distributions and upstream don't consider a problem at all. While fixing
these issues is and should be a goal of Debian, it's hardly something
that can be done in the last few weeks before releasing. The drawbacks
of delaying the release indefinitely for these bugs are much greater
than releasing with these minor DFSG violations.


In the following discussion, Robert Millan [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2008/10/msg00107.html)
a general resolution on how to deal with packages violating the
[Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines). In his proposal, packages having
a bug report open regarding their compliance with the Debian Free Software Guidelines for a certain amount of time
must be moved from the main section to the non-free section. In his response to Robert's initial
[proposal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2008/10/msg00010.html), Release Wizard Steve Langasek
[argued](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2008/10/msg00128.html) that Debian has been following the road of
incremental improvement. He notes that all bugs reported regarding non-free
firmware for older releases have been dealt with.


**State of NEW queue**


Aurelien Jarno [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/10/msg00071.html) whether the NEW queue (where
uploaded source packages creating new binary packages are held back awaiting the check and approval of an ftp-master)
is currently being processed. JÃ¶rg Jaspert [answered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/10/msg00180.html) that
the NEW queue has indeed not been processed very often recently. He explained further that changes in the software used to
process this queue give precedence to packages that only add new binary components, as distinct from packages that add completely
new code to the archive.


**Changes to archive.debian.org**


JÃ¶rg Jaspert [announced](http://blog.ganneff.de/blog/2008/10/26/archiving-sarge-aka-oldstable.html) several
changes for archive.debian.org, the most important being that Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 Sarge has been moved
from the regular mirrors to archive.debian.org.
[For the convenience of our mirror network](https://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors-announce/2008/11/msg00000.html),
the deletion is being performed in several chunks, avoiding problems with mirrors refusing
to delete too many files at once. He later
[highlighted](http://blog.ganneff.de/blog/2008/11/02/archivedebianorg-old-bugs-and.html) that the
unofficial port of Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 Sarge to the AMD64 architecture has been moved there, too.


Other changes are the availability of binary packages for Debian GNU/Linux 1.2 Rex, 1.1 Buzz and 0.93R6. An
archive for packages from [volatile.debian.org](https://www.debian.org/volatile/),
[security.debian.org](https://www.debian.org/security/) and [www.backports.org](http://www.backports.org)
is now also available at archive.debian.org.


During work on this, old mail archives from 1995, which had been lost, were found again as well as old bug
reports ranging from bug #350 to #1750. These will soon be added back to the appropriate archives.


**BTS-link in need of new maintainer**


Pierre Habouzit [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/10/msg00006.html) that
he won't be able to maintain and run the BTS-link service any more. This service is used to track activity
in upstream bug tracking systems and update the corresponding bug reports in
Debian's BTS in a semi-automated way. Currently this service needs to be run manually. Don Armstrong,
one of the maintainers of Debian's BTS, [highlighted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/10/msg00860.html)
the importance of the bts-link service, but won't be able to maintain it himself. Christoph Berg
[suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2008/10/msg00066.html) maintainership under the mantle
of Debian's Quality Assurance group if someone would volunteer to act as the main responsible maintainer.


**New Developers**


Since the previous issue of the Debian Project News, 2 applicants have been
accepted as Debian Maintainers.


Please welcome Mehdi Dogguy and Olly Betts to our project!
