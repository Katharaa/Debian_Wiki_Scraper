====================================


Welcome to this year's 4th issue of DPN, the newsletter for the Debian
community.  

Some of the topics covered in this issue:


* Release Update
* Beta-2 of the Lenny Debian Installer released

* ... and much more.


**Release Update**


Marc Brockschmidt [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/06/msg00000.html)
 about the status of the upcoming stable release. After some major transitions, like the

[transition](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2008/06/ocaml_3.10.2_is_in_testing/)
Lenny is in good shape, but still a lot of work needs to be done.
Since the armel architecture made great improvements the release team
decided to upgrade it to a proper release architecture.


Regarding Lenny the Qt/KDE Packaging Team
[decided](http://ekaia.org/blog/2008/06/08/lets-go-for-kde-359-in-lenny/) that
the upcoming release will be shipped with KDE 3.5.9 (and with the KDE 4.1
development platform: kde4libs, kdepimlibs and kdebase-runtime).


**Debian Installer for Lenny Beta-2 ready for testing**


The second beta version of the Debian Installer for the upcoming
release Lenny has been released. Some new or improved features are:


* Linux Kernel version 2.6.24
* i386 and amd64 have a new boot menu, allowing a more user-friendly selection of boot options (e.g. for the graphical installer)
* full support for encrypted partitioning for the graphical installer
* The installer will warn users when the translation of the installer to their language is incomplete
* When using the KDE or Xfce CD images it is now possible to select additional tasks


Images for different installation media and architectures are available
for [testing](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/). After using
the Debian-Installer, please send an [installation report](https://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/en.i386/ch05s04.html#submit-bug), even if there
weren't any problems.


**Bits from the ftp-masters**


Joerg Jaspert sent out [bits from the ftp-masters](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/05/msg00012.html)
containing recent
activities of that team, including some personnel changes as well as a lot
of code changes regarding Debian's infrastructure improving the overall
teamwork, for example by making it easier for the release team to handle
transitions. He also asked for volunteers for new ftp assistants. Later he
[reported](http://blog.ganneff.de/blog/2008/06/05/ftp-assistants.html)
that he already got four volunteers as well as several other suggestions
for improvements.


**Report from LinuxTag 2008**


[Bastian Venthur](http://blog.venthur.de/2008/05/31/linuxtag-2008/) and
[Noel Koethe](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2008/06/msg00001.html)
reported about this year's Debian booth at the LinuxTag 2008, a major conference
about free software in Europe. Marko Jung, one of the organisers,
[added thanks](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2008/06/msg00003.html)
for the good job the booth staff did. He also notes, that there was a high demand
from the visitors' side for a Debian sub-conference at next year's LinuxTag.


**Handling of removed packages**


Marc Brockschmidt wondered about the proper way to
[handle packages removed between two releases](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/05/msg01100.html).
One of his major concerns are packages becoming unsupported without users
noticing it. Several people replied, that package management tools are
already trying to notify users, while
[Frans Pop pointed out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/05/msg01103.html), that the
[release notes](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/release-notes/ch-upgrading#s-obsolete)
have a chapter handling this issue.


**French debconf translations completed**


Christian Perrier [reported](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2008/06/01#french-100-virtually)
that the french translation team finished translating all templates for the debconf system,
helping users to configure packages on installation time. He notes, that some of these packages
still need to add the translated templates. German, Czech and Portuguese are also quite close to
the 100% mark.


**Call for help by the German translation team**


The German translation team sent a
[call for help](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-german/2008/05/msg01534.html)
for the translation of package descriptions. The upcoming stable release will support
showing users translated descriptions of available packages, but currently only 2100 of
the more than 18000 package descriptions are translated to German. The [statistics](https://ddtp.debian.org/ddtss/index.cgi/xx)
for other languages are similar. Information on how to help the ongoing translation
effort is available at
[our website](https://www.debian.org/international/l10n/ddtp).


**Other News**


The 8th issue of the [miscellaneous news for developers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/05/msg00013.html)
has been released and covers the following
topics: Minor update to the mailing list code of conduct, Document aimed at
upstreams in preparation, d-i beta2 in preparation (breaks beta 1), New
transition check tool.


Christian Perrier reported [some news](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2008/06/01#samba-may31)
from samba packages development team. He later asked for tests of his
[Samba 3.2.0-rc1 packages](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2008/06/01#samba-32rc1).


Petter Reinholdtsen found some ways to reduce the boot time of his Debian system
[by 37,5%](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/05/msg01119.html) and asked
for further ideas.


Norbert Tretkowski [reported](http://tretkowski.de/blog/archives/415-5-years-backports.org.html),
that backports.org, a service providing unofficial updated packages for the current stable
release, turned 5 years old on May 27th. Congratulations!


Sandro Tosi
[uploaded a new version of reportbug](http://sandrotosi.blogspot.com/2008/05/reportbug-340-in-unstable.html),
which is now maintained in a team.
