Debian Weekly News - April 11th, 2000
=====================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.




For a [long time](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/24/#signdebs) everyone has been aware
of a **basic security problem in Debian**: packages can be changed on
Debian mirrors and users have no way to verify that the package they download
is the same package a developer uploaded. Two ideas have come up again and
again as ways to make this more secure. The first idea is to allow for
signatures inside the .deb files themselves, which lets one verify that a
given developer built a package. The second is to allow for signed Packages.gz
files, which lets one verify that the package went through the normal
upload process. Neither of these signatures will provide perfect security.
There are many holes left; for example, a developer's computer may be
cracked and if they do not manage their keys wisely, their key may be
compromised. In the past, in typical Debian fashion, we have held off doing
anything since there was no known perfect solution.




This issue has
[resurfaced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0003/msg01283.html) this week, and there is a growing inclination to implement
both types of signatures, though both are imperfect, to allow the
security bar to at least be raised a bit higher. After some
[long
discussions](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0004/msg00013.html) on the
[mailing
lists](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0004/msg00188.html) and on
[irc](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0004/msg00245.html),
more and more **people are reaching consensus on this**. Now, who will
implement it?




**5 new mailing lists** have been
[created](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0003/msg01812.html), for purposes ranging from porting to the PA-RISC and S/390 to
Dutch internationalisation.




**Direct access to the Incoming directory** is now available at
<http://incoming.debian.org/>. The
old Incoming mirror network is being
[shut
down](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0004/msg00000.html).




The IBM Global Services "Linux Support Line" in conjunction with AlcÃ´ve
will now offer **phone support for Debian in several countries**.
Interestingly, their [press
release](http://linuxpr.com/releases/1596.html) claims that Debian is *the current market leader (27%)*.

* [abook](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/mail/abook): A text-based ncurses address book application.
