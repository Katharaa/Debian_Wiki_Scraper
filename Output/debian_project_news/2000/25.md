Debian Weekly News - August 9th, 2000
=====================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.




**Debian will be awarded the $25,000 IDG/Linus Torvalds Community
Award** at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo. Here's the
[full announcement](http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=Coy40qbKbyti2mZC). This should happen roughly at the same time Debian
2.2 is released, and a release party of some sort is planned to happen
during LinuxWorld, which is shaping up to be an eventful show for Debian.




**A release announcement is being prepared.** A lot of
[brainstorming](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0008/msg00160.html) has been going on as we try to find and remember
important changes in potato that we can brag about, and several rough
drafts have already been written.




**Members of the #debian irc channel on irc.debian.org are preparing for the
onslaught of questions when Debian 2.2 is released.** They're
[organising a round-the-clock support crew](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2000/25/mail#mail1) dubbed the
"*Mobile Array of Support Helpers for Potato (MashPotato)*" that will
"*provide the most comprehensive Debian GNU/Linux support service that
we can to users both new and old.*"




**This week's security fixes** include a
[fix for a hole](http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=1&date=2000-08-01&msg=kK1VsC.A.fv.4iVj5@murphy)
in unstable's mailman package that allowed local users to take over the
list user, and a
[security fix for ntop](http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=1&date=2000-08-01&msg=EoeHb.A.ILB.Hjyj5@murphy) that fixes that program's web mode so it cannot be
used to view every file on the system.
A security hole in mailx and suidperl is the big security hole of the week,
but Debian
[narrowly escaped](https://cgi.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?archive=no&bug=68723&reverse=yes) being vulnerable.




**More news from Debian-derived distributions.**
Storm Linux 2000 Starter Edition has been released. Interestingly,
their
[press
release](http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=Coy:fWbWbtefuvta4mG) says it is "*built around the Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 "potato"
release, the most stable and secure distribution available*", even though
2.2 is not yet released. Also, another Debian-based distribution has
shown up: [DemoLinux](http://www.demolinux.org/) 2.0 is now
[Debian
based](http://www.demolinux.org/en/versions/version-debian.html). And finally, any Corel users who want to upgrade to potato can
check out this [Corel to Debian micro-howto](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2000/25/mail#mail2).
