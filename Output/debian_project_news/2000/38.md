Debian Weekly News - November 22nd, 2000
========================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.




**A raft of recent security fixes** include fixes for a local
[cron exploit](https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20001118a), a
[serious hole](https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20001118) in ssh, a
[local root exploit](https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20001120) in
modutils (Debian is vulnerable after all),
[a bug in
mc](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0011/msg03289.html) that allows anyone to overwrite the first byte of any file,
[a
buffer overflow in ncurses](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00083.html) that can be exploited via
[suid binaries in xmcd](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00084.html), a
[symlink attack](https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20001122) using joe's
DEADJOE files and a
[similar problem in elvis-tiny](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00085.html), a remote exploit that can
[crash tcpdump](https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20001120a), a similar
[buffer overflow](https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20001122a) in ethereal,
and an [updated cupsys package](https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20001119)
that doesn't default to letting anyone in the world access the printer.
More security fixes continue to come in as DWN goes to press.
This has been the busiest week for the security team in recent memory, and
they've certainly done a good job.




**Debian 2.2r2 will probably be released by this weekend.** Anthony Towns
and Ben Collins argued about this, with Anthony wanting
[get r2
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0011/msg00062.html) within the promised time frame to fix the problems in r1, while Ben
prefers to
[wait a
week or two](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0011/msg00068.html) for testing, even more pending security fixes, and to let the
porters catch up so we do not "*make another point release, with known
issues*". Anthony rejected this plan, stating that "*it'll be out around
the 24th, US holiday or not*". This is a tough call -- more security holes
will surely be found soon after we release -- but it's the kind of tough call
that Anthony as release manager has to make, even if his decision is not
popular.




**One of this week's more interesting threads concerns women in
Debian.** [The thread](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0011/msg01352.html) touches on many subjects: the number of female developers
(a few, with more in the queue), why there are so relatively few women
in Debian and the free software world in general (is Debian "*the
epitome of the all guys testosterone engineering groups*"?), and lots of
general discussion not specific to Debian. It's clearly an interesting
topic, but we should pay heed to An Thi-Nguyen Le when she
[points
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0011/msg01363.html), "*We're all just dudes who happen to work on Debian.*"




**The [Debian Jr. project](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-jr/)
is [collecting ideas for a logo](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-jr/News/2000/20001119).** The project also has a dedicated irc
channel now, #debian-jr on irc.debian.org.




**[debianHELP](http://www.debianhelp.org/) is the
latest new Debian website.** Their purpose is to "*provide some in-depth,
non-geek explanations about the common problems that people run into*", and
the site is taking off quickly, already full of topics like "*What to do
when unstable goes bad*", "*Printing in Debian*", "*Managing kernel
modules*", and a fair number of useful tips.




**Debian won several awards this month.** Debian received a
[reader's
choice award for web infrastructure](http://www.webtechniques.com/wtawards/2000/index.shtml) from WebTechniques magazine, and a
VA Linux system with Debian pre-loaded received Linux Journal's
[editor's choice award for best web server](http://www2.linuxjournal.com/cgi-bin/frames.pl/index.html). There seems to be a theme
here..
