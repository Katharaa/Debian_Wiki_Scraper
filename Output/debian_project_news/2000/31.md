Debian Weekly News - September 26th, 2000
=========================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.




**Be careful**. If you have grown complacent tracking unstable for the
past month, and were wondering why nothing has broken yet, wonder no
more. Unstable now has several breakages, most of them centered around a
[new
version of libc](https://lists.debian.org/debian-glibc-0009/msg00022.html). It is known to [break exim](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2000/31/mail#mail1),
[sendmail](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2000/31/mail#mail2), perl, and apache, and may break other packages
as well.




**This week's only security update** was a
[fix
for a root exploit](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00042.html) in sysklogd. This one could be exploited remotely in
theory. Slink users have been given a short reprieve: the security team has
[decided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00043.html) based on the feedback it has received to keep producing security
updates for Debian 2.1 until October 30th, 2000.




Several threads this week involved **Debian's support of emerging
technologies**. It's now possible for any Debian developer to join the
6bone with a
[few
simple commands](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg01457.html), which nicely demonstrates that Debian's ipv6 support is
usable, and should encourage developers to work on making their packages
support ipv6. There has been
[talk](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg01712.html)
of making ipv6 support a tentative release goal for woody.
[Another
thread](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0009/msg00054.html) discussed preparing Debian to use capabilities. In it, NicolÃ¡s
Lichtmaier pointed out that on a capability-based system, root shouldn't
necessarily be able to write to files like /bin/ls, and he proposed
we make all such files be owned by a special group such as "bin". But linux
capabilities are still
[under
development](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0009/msg00076.html), not yet supported by the filesystem, and so on, so it may
not yet be time to worry about them.




**Mentions of Debian in the media this week:**



* The Duke of URL
[reviewed
Debian 2.2](http://www.thedukeofurl.org/reviews/misc/debian22/), with mostly favorable results if you can stand the
kernel/distribution confusion like "*Debian reached a milestone,
Potato, or 2.2. Immediately after that, a couple distributions started
using the 2.2 kernel, including such popular ones as Stormix's
Storm Linux 2000*" This review is no more and no less shallow than most
linux distribution
reviews -- so it's not quite [the perfect review](http://www.advogato.org/article/169.html).
* The most recent [Linux Weekly News](http://lwn.net/2000/0921/)
opened with a look at Debian's organizational structure.
"*Kernel development looks
like a benevolent dictator floating serenely above a screaming bazaar of hackers loudly trying to get their
patches noticed and accepted. Apache is an anarchic, but calmer group of people quietly implementing
the features they need. Debian, instead, resembles an established constitutional democracy, complete
with elections and a civil bureaucracy.*"
Overall it's a good summary, though it is conspicuously quiet on the subject
of the infamous Cabal. Debian can certainly overdo the bureaucracy at times,
as is exemplified by
[this post](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg01876.html):
"*the shenanigans of altering the quorum requirements for the final vote on
the GR based upon the vote on the proposed amendment to it are totally
out-of-line and in gross violation of the letter and the spirit of the
Constitution.*"



Manoj Srivastava
[posted a
draft](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0009/msg00044.html) of the **Debian packaging manual that he hopes will be blessed
into policy**. Whether the Debian packaging manual has been a part of
policy all along is unclear; the new draft excises some parts of the manual
that do not belong in policy. If this is accepted, the API's of various
parts of Debian such as the fields in the control file and the way postinst
scripts are called will all become part of policy.




**Internationalization of Packages files** was also
[discussed
this week](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n-0009/msg00004.html). While figuring out how to allow for the fields in the control
file to be internationalized is hard enough, it looks like the real problem
will be making dpkg use the translations in a
[sane fashion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n-0009/msg00014.html). Nothing conclusive has yet come from the thread.




**Debian's main web server suffered a dead disk drive** and is
[offline](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg01724.html)
while a replacement is being readied.
Besides serving as the Debian web server, va.debian.org was Debian's cvs
server. All of its functions have been moved to other Debian servers in the
meantime.
