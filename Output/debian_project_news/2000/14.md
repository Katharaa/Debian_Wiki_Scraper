Debian Weekly News - May 3rd, 2000
==================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.




**Debian has [entered](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2000/14/mail#mail1) the first Test Cycle.**
Richard Braakman first [removed 17 packages](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2000/14/mail#mail2)
with release critical bugs from the distribution, which has reduced the
number of release critical bugs to
[less than 100](http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/). The only
changes that will occur in potato in next 2 weeks are a final boot-floppies
update and CD image creation. Potato should be ready for testing in a few
days, once these final pieces have settled. At that point, any interested
users are encouraged to upgrade, and help
[test](https://lists.debian.org/debian-testing-0004/msg00027.html)
the distribution.




Wichert Akkerman
[posted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0004/msg01491.html)
a **rough proposal for a new source package format**. Some discussion
ensued and it became clear that we don't yet have a consensus about everything
a new source format should do, or how it should work.




**Other discussion topics this week** include a
[long
thread](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0004/msg01377.html) about what to do after potato is released and about release
management and timelines in general, a thread about phasing out override
files, and discussion about [Microsoft's patent](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2000/14/mail#mail3) on
"installing and updating program module components" over the net, which we
must hope doesn't really cover anything Debian has been doing for the past
4 years.




**New packages** in Debian unstable this week include the following and 45 more:



* [digitaldj](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/sound/digitaldj): An SQL based mp3 player front-end
