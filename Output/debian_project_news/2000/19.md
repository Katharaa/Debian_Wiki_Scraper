Debian Weekly News - June 21st, 2000
====================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.




**Release news:**
Richard Braakman will be gone for a week or two, and unable to serve as
release manager. In the meantime, Anthony Towns will be
[stepping in](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0006/msg00006.html) as Acting Release Manager. Anthony has already
[posted plans](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0006/msg00007.html) to end the current test cycle in the middle of this week,
and has [listed the changes](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2000/19/mail#mail1) he plans to accept
into potato before the next test cycle.



**There are two security fixes this week.** A
[fix is available](https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20000619) for a bug
in xinetd's access control mechanism, and a remote exploit of zope has also been
[fixed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0006/msg01541.html).




**Looking ahead to woody**, Joey Hess is
[stepping
up](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0006/msg00279.html) as the new leader of the woody boot-floppies team. The goal is to
redesign the installation system and replace it with something more modular,
flexible, smaller, and easier to use. Debian Weekly News wishes the
boot-floppies team (and its upcoming leader ;-) luck on this ambitious
endeavor. 




**Another item removed from dpkg's wishlist:** For years, we have run into
occasional problems where the simplest solution was "use versioned provides".
Unfortunately, the Provides: field in Debian packages has never
supported versioning.
[It
does now.](https://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg-0006/msg00025.html) However, Jason Gunthorpe
[points
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg-0006/msg00029.html) that using versioned provides in woody will probably lead to all sorts
of upgrade trouble.




**Debian's voting system**, as established in the
[Debian Constitution](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution),
employs an interesting voting method called Concorde voting. Since Debian
is one of the few real-world organizations to make use of this type of vote
counting, we've attracted the interest of members of the
[Election Methods mailing list](http://www.eskimo.com/~robla/em/).
This week, Norman Petry, a member of the Election Methods list,
[posted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0006/msg00095.html)
about a "*circular tie*" situation where no one wins a vote, and the
constitution does not specify what should be done, leading to an undefined
outcome. He has calculated that "*you can expect to encounter a circular tie
about once every 20 elections or so, on average*". He suggests that we
proactively modify the constitution to fix the problem before it occurs.




Followups to last week's news:



* The discussion about dropping non-free from Debian has died down. The
issue is not resolved though, and will come to vote soon.
* Last week's offer of $3k to KDE If they could fix their license has led to
more Debian/KDE articles, including a
[Freshmeat
Editorial](http://freshmeat.net/news/2000/06/17/961300740.html) by Joseph Carter. It appears that Dr. Bechly has
[withdrawn the offer](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/06/13/1642213&mode=nested), after KDE declined to send him an official
response. He has retargeted the money to Debian, in hopes of improving
Debian's installer.
