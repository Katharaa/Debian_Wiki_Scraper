Debian Weekly News - August 29th, 2000
======================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
This has been a relatively quiet week, with only 400 messages posted to
debian-devel.




**The "testing" distribution, as discussed last week, may not become a
reality as soon as was hoped.** The holdup is Debian's mirror network.
Anthony Towns has
[found a
problem](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0008/msg01268.html) that will make testing, as it is implemented now, consume about 50
MB of bandwidth a day on each Debian mirror. The long term solution to this
type of problem is a package pool system. Of course, we've been talking
about package pools for years now. To make testing happen soon, we need to
come up with a good short-term solution, and so far, no one has done so.




**The Debian bug tracking system's web site** is
[partially
down](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0008/msg01158.html). All of the static pages on the site are out of date and are not being
updated, due to some issues with the programs that update them. The plan is
to convert the remaining static pages into dynamically generated pages.
Toward that end, dynamically generated lists of bugs by package maintainer
are [already
available](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0008/msg01512.html). Dynamically generated pages, and the underlying email-based
bug tracking system, continue to work fine -- in fact, the bug tracking system
recorded [bug #70000](https://bugs.debian.org/70000) this week.




**This week's longest thread concerned the Helix Gnome Debian packages.**
While the [original issue](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0008/msg01297.html) was quickly resolved, several other problems in Helix's
packages were discussed, particularly
[version
number issues](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0008/msg01341.html). The Helix Gnome packages currently use "helix" in their
debian revision number, which makes them always appear to be newer than
updated packages from Debian itself. Thus, while apt makes it easy to install
Helix Gnome, getting rid of it is somewhat harder. It's
[rumored](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0008/msg01341.html)
that future enhancements to apt will solve the version number problem. But
the underlying problem seems to be one of communication. Debian derivatives
need to be careful to communicate with Debian, and do things the Debian
way, to avoid having these kinds of problems blow up in their faces.




**Security fixes** this week include an updated version of
[netscape](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0008/msg01998.html) that fixes several security holes including the "Brown Orifice"
hole, a fix for a remote root exploit in
[ntop](http://lwn.net/daily/deb-ntop.php3), a fun URL vulnerability
in [xchat](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0008/msg02384.html), and a remote file access problem in
[eruby](https://bugs.debian.org/69916).




**Meanwhile,** SecurityPortal posted
[an
article](https://web.archive.org/web/20010309114246/http://www.securityportal.com/closet/closet20000830.html) that is quite critical of Debian's security. "*The odd thing
is that Debian seems to have gotten the niggly little details right, but
there are major issues they haven't addressed.*" Valid points
include the lack of signed .deb's, with a few more examples of how this
is indeed a really bad thing, and the lack of a prompt for a lilo password.
There are many criticisms in the article though, that are more dubious.
They've already corrected their worst mistakes -- see the sidebar. Also,
see the [slashdot coverage](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/08/30/1211232&mode=nested) which includes a response from developer Ben Collins.




**Debian foils computer theft.** Read all about it in
[this hilarious
story](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/12833.html) in The Register.




**Debian finally includes gopher, after all these years.** Here are some
of the [new
packages](http://auric.debian.org/~tausq/newpkgs-20000829.html) added to Debian this week:



* [gopher](https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/net/gopher.html): Distributed
Hypertext Client, Gopher protocol
* [gopherd](https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/net/gopherd.html): Gopher
server
* [v4l-conf](https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/graphics/v4l-conf.html): tool
to configure video4linux drivers
