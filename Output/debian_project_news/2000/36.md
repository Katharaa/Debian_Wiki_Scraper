Debian Weekly News - November 7th, 2000
=======================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.




**XFree86 4.0.1 has
[entered unstable](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0011/msg00160.html).** The new version of X took significant effort to
package -- Branden Robinson worked on it nearly full time for "*about 4
months*", reorganizing the entire set of packages, waiting for security
holes to be fixed, and producing some 50 test releases to work out all the
kinks. The result is a surprisingly polished upgrade (by unstable's standards
anyway -- [many
problems](https://bugs.debian.org/branden@debian.org) are still being encountered).




**A slightly less polished upgrade involving perl 5.6 and dpkg 1.7.0 has
also hit unstable.** A bug in the update-alternatives provided by the new
version of dpkg [broke perl](https://bugs.debian.org/76438) for a
while, and though the problem is at least partly
[resolved by now](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0011/msg00002.html), many smaller problems are still being dealt with.
Unstable seems likely to live up to its name for the next week or two.




**The new version of dpkg** has
[several new features](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0011/msg00003.html), including support for marking the origin of a
package for use by third party .deb creators like HelixCode that should
allow bugs to be directed to the right place, a "*statoverride*"
mechanism that allows overriding the permissions of any file on the system
across upgrades, an improved dpkg-shlibdeps, and a new
/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg config file.




**Progeny has [announced a public
beta test](http://www.progeny.com/debian/) of Progeny Debian**, "*an open source, commercial version of
Debian*". According to the press release, "*Progeny Debian features a
new installer, as well as new tools for administration, configuration and
package management*" An announcement posted to debian-devel
provides [more
details](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg02219.html): They have modified several Debian packages to add Gnome interfaces,
so their package management is done via "gtasksel", a modified tasksel, and
package configuration makes heavy use of Debconf with a Gnome frontend. Other
features include hardware autodetection and GRUB. Progeny was asked if their
enhancements will be contributed back to Debian, and
[responded](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0011/msg00029.html)
"*Yes, at the discretion of the Debian maintainers of the relevant
packages.*" Progeny Debian is based on unstable, and "*has been tested
thoroughly by Progeny's developers*" -- as such, once it comes out of beta,
it might serve as a useful upgrade for those who need unstable's features but
cannot deal with daily upgrades and breakage. (See also:
[an
article on Debian Planet](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://www.debianplanet.org/debianplanet/article.php?sid=28) about Debian and commercial variants.)




**The first in a series of weekly debian-installer status reports** was
[released](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0011/msg00092.html),
detailing what progress is being made on the new Debian installer, and
listing the many parts that have yet to be written.
