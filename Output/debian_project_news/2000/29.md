Debian Weekly News - September 12th, 2000
=========================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.




**KDE packages are pouring into Debian.** All of the core of KDE is already
present in unstable, and more packages are sure to follow. This unexpected
turn of events is due to a change in the license of Qt 2.2 -- Troll Tech
released it dual-licensed
[under the
GPL](http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/2269/1/) -- the KDE licensing issue is finally resolved.
For an excellent summary of the Debian/KDE issue and recent events,
look no farther than
[this
article in LinuxPlanet](http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/opinions/2281/1/).




Besides the good news about Qt, **several other important licensing
issues**
have recently surfaced. Python 1.6 was released, under a license that may
have [compatibility problems](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0009/msg00029.html)
with the GPL. Gregor Hoffleit, our python maintainer, is taking a
[cautious
approach](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg00649.html) to this possible problem -- there is still hope that the new
license will be fixed to be GPL compatible. Meanwhile, the RSA algorithm was
released into the [public domain](http://www.rsasecurity.com/news/pr/000906-1.html). This should allow some software such as gpg-rsa and pgp-i
to [move from
non-free into Debian main](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg00450.html), although they may remain in non-us for now
since they involve encryption.




[Plans are being laid](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2000/29/mail#mail1) for a **point release of
potato:** Debian 2.2r1. It will include security fixes, boot-floppy
bugfixes, other important bug fixes, updated release notes, and perhaps a
very few additional packages, like console-apt, that didn't make 2.2r0.




**The most notable technical thread** on the lists this week concerned
changing the manner in which packages start and restart daemons when they are
installed. The current behavior -- always start a package's daemon when it
is installed -- isn't the behavior one would expect if a system is running
in single user mode, and it can be rather inflexible for other needs, such
as installing into a chroot. Henrique M. Holschuh
[proposed a
new method](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg00666.html) of determining if a daemon should be started at package install
time that addresses these issues. However, it would require additional code to
be placed in every package that uses it, and it still has some unresolved
technical details.




**A slew of security fixes** have appeared in the past two weeks. In
approximate order of importance, they include:



* A [remote shell exploit for
horde and imp](https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20000910).
* A [remote root exploit in
libpam-smb](https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20000911).
* Two [local root
vulnerabilities in glibc](https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20000902).
* A [privilege elevation
exploit](https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20000902a) for screen.
* A [remote shell exploit in muh](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0009/msg00901.html).
* Two [vulnerabilities in
xpdf](https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20000910a).
* A [fork bomb attack involving
tmpreaper](https://bugs.debian.org/71249).
