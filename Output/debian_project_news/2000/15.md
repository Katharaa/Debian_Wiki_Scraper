Debian Weekly News - May 9th, 2000
==================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.




Thanks to the Test Cycle, little has been happening in Debian this week,
which makes this a good time for some sysadminly activities on the
Debian servers:



* **The main Debian archive
[has
moved](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0005/msg00342.html)** from master.debian.org to auric.debian.org
(aka ftp-master.debian.org). Auric is our
[new UltraSPARC](https://www.debian.org/News/2000/20000317). This move has
been planned for some time, but it was triggered by a disk crash on master.
This will reduce the load on master and increase the speed of the daily
archive updates.
* Jason Gunthorpe [explained](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2000/15/mail#mail1)
**changes to master.debian.org's mail server**. At last
master is using a free mail server, instead of qmail. Jason reports that he
has "*painstakingly converted all the .qmail files into comparable .forward
files where possible, and mailed people otherwise*". LDAP is now used to
automatically route @debian.org mail to the correct destination.



**The first Test Cycle** is a week old now, but final CD images for it
have not been announced. The boot floppies are
[ready](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0005/msg00023.html)
though. Release-related posts this week included a look at
[archive
consistency](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0005/msg00352.html)
and [discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0005/msg00018.html) about release notes and upgrade procedures from versions of Debian as
old as 1.1.




**The new maintainer team** now has a
[web site](https://nm.debian.org/) with
a database of prospective new maintainers that keeps track of how far along
in the process each person is. 66 people are moving through the queue. Dale
Scheetz
[mentioned](http://cipsa.physik.uni-freiburg.de/pipermail/nm-discuss/2000-May/000378.html) that he is going to start working through the backlog of people
who applied to become maintainers since last October.




**The Debian S/390 port** seems to be getting off to a [good
start](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2000/15/mail#mail2).




**New packages** in Debian this week include the following and 29 more:



* [bwap](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/bwap): Napster
client based on BitchX
* [bwap-gtk](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/bwap-gtk):
GTK interface for BWap
* [libapache-mod-speedycgi](https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/web/libapache-mod-speedycgi.html): apache module to speed up perl scripts by
making them persistent.
* [libpam-mysql](https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/admin/libpam-mysql.html): PAM module allowing authentication from a MySQL server
* [libvoxel1](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/libs/libvoxel1):
Voxel Engine library
