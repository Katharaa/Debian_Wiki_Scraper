Debian Weekly News - January 4th, 2005
======================================


Welcome to this year's 1st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Martin Michlmayr [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2004/12/msg00277.html) that JÃ¶rg Jaspert has been appointed as an additional Debian
account manager. The Debian project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2005/20050101) another update of their [stable release](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/). Joey Hess [published](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/12/msg00198.html) a list of security problems fixed in unstable but pending in
sarge.


**New Arch and Subversion Server.** Wichert Akkerman [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/12/msg00009.html) the move of all arch and subversion repositories to a new
server. The switch to the fsfs backend for subversion will fix problems
resulting from dead locks, stalled processes and incorrect access lists. He
later [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/12/msg00011.html) that the move was successful.


**Meaning of GNU/Linux.** Ed White [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2004/12/msg00269.html) that Debian's interpretation of the term GNU/Linux is wrong according
to a recent [interview](http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2004/12/22/rms_interview.html) with Richard Stallman where he explained that the term GNU/Linux
means that the system started out as GNU, with Linux added. Peter Karlsson [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2004/12/msg00272.html)
that it's just a matter of interpretation. Either one starts with the Linux
kernel and adds the GNU tools, then the wording on the Debian web pages is
correct, or one starts with the GNU tools and adds a kernel, for instance
Linux.


**Mozilla Trademark Restrictions.** Alexander Sack [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00328.html)
that the Debian project can be forced to change the name of all Mozilla
related packages because of the Mozilla [trademark
restrictions](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy.html). He also asked if this naming restrictions would make the
packages non-free. Several suggestions for new names included Freebird,
Freefox and Freezilla with or without the distribution name. Don Armstrong [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00331.html)
a distribution-neutral naming scheme for non-official Mozilla packages.


**Debian Eyecatcher Project started.** Alexander Schmehl
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc/2005/01/msg00029.html)
that he has started the [Eyecatcher](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/eyecatcher/) project.
The idea is to create some kind of informative and funny
presentation about Debian which could be run in a loop on fairs, when
the booth personnel have nothing else to show or while it is busy with other
visitors. Help on this project would be appreciated.


**On Packaging MPEG Encoders.** The [question](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg02199.html)
why `lame` couldn't be packaged and distributed in Debian recently
came up. Chris Cheney [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg02201.html)
that it is patent-encumbered by a company enforcing its patents. Florian
Weimer [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg02219.html)
that even while software cannot be patented in Europe currently, it can
infringe patent claims, which is more relevant for Debian.


**Experimental Buildd Network?** Frank KÃ¼ster [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg02271.html)
if packages in `experimental` were autobuilt. Martin Michlmayr [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg02272.html) that Andreas Barth is running a buildd network for
`experimental`. He [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg02275.html)
that versioned build-dependencies from `experimental` are not [supported](https://people.debian.org/~aba/buildd/exp-dep.html).


**ITP Reminder Mails.** Justin Pryzby [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg02310.html)
if he should send reminder mails to those who opened an intent-to-package
(ITP) bug report and where the bug report hasn't seen any traffic in the last
four months. This effort was mostly appreciated last time and the [results](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2004/04/msg00094.html)
sent to the QA group.


**Origin of the Debian Swirl Logo.** Martin F. Krafft [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg02328.html)
where the current Debian [logo](https://www.debian.org/logos/) is from. Florian
Ernst [directed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2004/12/msg03402.html) readers to the [readme](https://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/webwml/webwml/english/logos/README?view=markup) file in the webserver source that explains that Raul M. Silva has
created the logo. The Debian project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/1999/19990826) the new logo back in August
1999 as a result of a GIMP contest and a subsequent vote among Debian
developers.


**Detecting uninstalled Packages.** Martin Michlmayr [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2004/12/msg00043.html) for a
list of packages that are not installed by anybody or only by a few people.
Frank Lichtenheld [revealed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2004/12/msg00044.html)
that this refers to about 230 (or 600 for less than two installations)
packages according to the [popularity
contest](https://popcon.debian.org/).


**Using the Term Debian.** JÃ¼rgen LÃ¼ters [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00312.html)
if he may use the term Debian as part of "Debian extended Xterminal" or
whether there are legal obstacles even though the scripts will be released
under the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) as well.
Brian Thomas Sniffen [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00325.html) that the [trademark](https://www.debian.org/News/1998/19980306a) could
indeed prevent him from using the term.


**Bug Squashing Party next Weekend.** Frank Lichtenheld [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/01/msg00000.html) a bug squashing party to take place from January 7th to 9th in
#debian-bugs on irc.debian.org. He wrote that over the last weeks the
release-critical bug count has increased again. There are probably several
reasons this has happened (e.g. many people on vacation, stalls in the testing
migration due to gcc and perl problems etc.).


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
