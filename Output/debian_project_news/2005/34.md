Debian Weekly News - August 23rd, 2005
======================================


Welcome to this year's 34th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. The Debian project leader has [delegated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/08/msg00219.html)
to Don Armstrong the authority to make a decision regarding the use of the
Debian trademark by the (as currently named) DCC Alliance. Mick Weiss [thought](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01313.html)
about setting up [torrents](https://www.debian.org/CD/torrent-cd/) for large sets
of data, not only CD and DVD images but also [videos](http://dc5video.debian.net/).


**Installing Debian on Sun Blade 150.** Nishant Sharma wrote a
short [howto](http://nishants.net/articles/sunblade150.htm) on
installing Debian on a Sun Blade 150, a 64 bit workstation based on the UltraSPARC
processor. The installation goes by the book, using the network installer.
Since configuring XFree86 is a bit tricky he provides a proper snippet from
the configuration file.


**Kernel Version Dependency.** Masanori Goto (後藤 正徳)
[noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-glibc/2005/08/msg00558.html)
that building glibc is not possible on 2.4 kernels anymore due to NPTL
threading support, which requires certain kernel versions. This poses a
problem when more architectures get NPTL support while their buildds still run
Linux 2.4.


**License Incompatibility.** Elimar Riesebieter [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00848.html)
that the new version of [moc](https://packages.debian.org/moc)
requires the [curl](https://packages.debian.org/libcurl3) library
which itself uses the [OpenSSL](https://packages.debian.org/libssl0.9.7) library. This poses a problem since moc is licensed under the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) which is not
compatible with the OpenSSL license. Torsten Landschoff [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00895.html)
that the same has happened to [libldap2](https://packages.debian.org/libldap2) before. Domenico Andreoli seems to be [willing](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01001.html)
to switch the curl library to [GNU
TLS](https://packages.debian.org/libgnutls11).


**Using LSB Init Scripts.** Marco d'Itri [considered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00854.html)
switching the init scripts of his packages to [lsb-base](https://packages.debian.org/lsb-base), which required it to
be promoted to priority important. Petter Reinholdtsen [provided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00860.html)
an easy way to use the LSB only when it is available. Thomas Hood even [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00972.html)
the lack of a progress function. The package `lsb-base` has since
then been promoted to the priority important, hence, the provided functions
may be used by all init scripts.


**Removing transitional Packages.** Mohammed AdnÃ¨ne Trojette
[would](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00869.html)
like to remove transitional [packages](http://adn.diwi.org/wiki/index.php/DummyPackagesList) that
were required for the upgrade from woody to sarge, since they are no longer
needed for the upgrade to etch. Steve Langasek [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00898.html)
that skipping a release is not supported when upgrading and, hence, these
transitional packages are only useless cruft that Debian should strive to get
rid of before the etch release.


**Problematic cyclic Dependencies.** Lars Wirzenius [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00925.html)
while working on [piuparts](https://packages.debian.org/piuparts)
that [dpkg](https://packages.debian.org/dpkg) isn't able to remove
some packages, that [turned
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00926.html) to have cyclic dependencies. In this case the removal script calls
a program from the other package that is already removed, which results in a
failure.


**Report from the first Debian Conference India.** Sundara
Nagarajan wrote a [report](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/0820-debconf-india-report) about the first [Debian Conference India](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/0820-debconf-india). Ramakrishnan Muthukrishnan and Ganesan Rajagopal
spoke about the Debian philosophy, process and their experience of becoming
Debian contributors. Ganesan also brought up his vision for integrating and
merging other India-based free and open source projects with Debian.


**Closing old Bug Reports.** Hamish Moffatt [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/08/msg00062.html)
when it is appropriate to close bug reports for a package that is only around
in woody (alias oldstable). Steve Langasek [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/08/msg00068.html)
how the commands `notfound`, `found` and
`close` work with the new version [tracking](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/07/msg00010.html) and Gustavo Franco [contributed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/08/msg00064.html)
a link to a [quick
reference](http://women.alioth.debian.org/wiki/index.php/English/NewBTSHowTo).


**Automatic Installation and Purging.** Lars Wirzenius is [running](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01133.html)
[piuparts](https://packages.debian.org/piuparts) against etch and
has discovered a lot of bugs that he would like to report properly. This
effort was widely [appreciated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01134.html) among readers. Petter Reinholdtsen [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01182.html)
if this work could be extended to test upgrades from woody to sarge and from
sarge to etch.


**Digital Signatures for Bug Handling?** Javier
FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino PeÃ±a had to [reopen](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01106.html) a
bug report that was accidentally closed by a spam message. He proposed to start
thinking about implementing authentication checks in the [bug tracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/). While contributors were not
opposed to this idea, they [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01124.html)
not to depend on only valid signatures from Debian developers.


**Shared Library Package Naming.** Junichi Uekawa (上川 純一)
[reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01433.html)
that the way to decide which `-dev` package accompanies which
runtime library package is to heuristically look at the `Packages`
file to investigate what packages are generated from the same source. Steve
Langasek [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01440.html) several options on how to deal with this in connection with [libtool](https://packages.debian.org/libtool).


**LDAP Gateway to the Bug Tracking System.** Andreas Barth [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01556.html)
that the LDAP gateway to the [bug tracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/)
(BTS) is running on master again, on port 10101. It had to be [turned
off](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01469.html) on the machine running the BTS due to horsepower limitations since it
also runs the archive as a temporary measurement.
