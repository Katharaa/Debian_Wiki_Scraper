Debian Weekly News - April 19th, 2005
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 16th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Micah Anderson [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00971.html)
that the oldest open [bug](https://bugs.debian.org/725) [reports](https://bugs.debian.org/825) in Debian turn ten this month.
Brian Proffitt [commented](http://linuxtoday.com/developer/2005041501526OPBZDV) on a [report](http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20050413005236&newsLang=en) about a survey that uncovered that in 2005 the majority of Free
Software developers preferred community-based distributions.


**Debian based Desktops in Munich.** The city of Munich [chose](http://www.muenchen.de/Rathaus/dir/limux/publikationen/news_archiv/127730/basis_client.html) (German) the Debian distribution as a basis for their desktop. Two
German companies will configure and maintain the 14,000 machines based on this
client. The [decision](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/37197) (German) to move away from a proprietary system had attracted a lot of
interest by all kinds of media.


**Interview with Branden Robinson.** Our former Editor Joe
'Zonker' Brockmeier conducted an [interview](http://www.linux-mag.com/content/view/1870/2107/) with
Branden Robinson, the new Debian Project Leader. He would like to put some
care into infrastructure that is often complained about and wants to emphasise
on Debian's continuing position as the most significant GNU/Linux
distribution. Regular reports will round this up.


**Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 updated.** The Debian project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2005/20050416) the fifth update to their
stable Distribution alias woody. It contains mostly those security updates
that have accumulated since January when the last update was made. Some
packages were also removed from the stable distribution, mostly due to license
infringements. A complete list of all accepted and removed packages together
with rationale is on the preparation [page](https://people.debian.org/~joey/3.0r5/).


**GPL Programs belong in non-free?** Adrian Bunk [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg00625.html)
that all programs licensed under the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) have to go into
non-free, since the GPL license itself must not be modified. Glenn Maynard [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg00640.html)
that the only reason the text of the GPL is allowed in main is because including
license texts is a fundamental, unavoidable requirement of distributing
software at all.


**IRC Meetings.** The Debian Kernel Team
held an [IRC
meeting](http://neualius.turmzimmer.net/~aba/kernel-irc-log) in which they [decided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2005/04/msg00488.html)
that the kernel in testing is frozen. A meeting of the AMD64 porters will [take](https://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64/2005/04/msg00496.html)
place on 23rd of April to discuss how to do an unofficial sarge release of
the AMD64 port. On the 26th of April there will also be a public IRC [meeting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/04/msg00014.html) of [SPI](https://www.spi-inc.org/).


**Further Restricting the GPL.** Warren Turkal [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/04/msg00044.html)
if [terms and conditions](http://www.sql-ledger.org/cgi-bin/nav.pl?page=misc/terms.html&title=Terms%20%26%20Conditions) in addition to the GNU GPL would render a package
non-free. Glenn Maynard [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/04/msg00045.html)
that granting the user permission by using the GPL but at the same time
limiting the rights with additional limitation puts software in an uncertain
state. Since Debian tends to honour the author's desires as closely as
possible this would imply that Debian shouldn't be distributing this
software.


**Kernel Firmware Blobs.** Sven Luther [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/04/msg00047.html)
a new discussion about binary blobs in kernel drivers without an explicit
copyright notice. Allegedly, these blobs are considered a mere aggregation of
bits and bytes that aren't linked into the kernel and hence don't infringe the
kernel license.


**Christian Debian Distribution.** RaphaÃ«l Pinson [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg00514.html)
about the start of [Ichtux](http://ichthux.free.fr/), a custom
Debian distribution (CDD) focusing on Christianity and free Christian
projects. They are currently considering becoming an official [CDD](https://people.debian.org/~tille/cdd/ch-starting.en.html) to be
included as such in the Debian project.


**Documentation Licensing FAQ.** Jacobo Tarrio [released](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/04/msg00332.html)
a draft [FAQ](http://jacobo.tarrio.org/Documentation_licensing_FAQ)
on documentation licensing. In this document he summarises several questions
and answers about this topic which should be useful especially for people who
have questions about the [GNU
FDL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).
