Debian Weekly News - December 20th, 2005
========================================


Welcome to this year's 51st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Mohammed Adnène Trojette summarised the events from last
year and created the [timeline
2004](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2004/timeline). Thomas Lange [announced](http://www.uni-koeln.de/bin2/maillist/linux-fai/20051213.170012/170506) version 2.9 of FAI, the fully automatic installation for
Debian.


**Debian on one DVD?** Jaldhar Vyas [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/12/msg00089.html)
that one of the problems GNU/Linux users in countries like India face is low
bandwidth. Therefore a distribution on CD or DVD is preferred over large
network installations or updates. He has found a sponsor and is looking for a
1-DVD version of the Debian system. Jörg Jaspert [confirmed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/12/msg00091.html)
that the production is easy since he's done it before.


**Four Years debianforum.de.** The web forum
[debianforum.de](http://debianforum.de/), aimed at German speaking
Debian Users, has had its fourth anniversary on December 20th.
With discussions like "How to install a program" this forum has
turned into an important site for both the Debian beginner and the
professional in German speaking countries. With booths on several GNU/Linux
Events the forum was also active outside the world wide web.


**Ballot: Declassification of private Mails.** Manoj
Srivastava [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/12/msg00075.html)
for [vote](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/12/msg00080.html) on the [declassification of
debian-private list archives](https://www.debian.org/vote/2005/vote_002) from December 18th to December 31th. When
passed a committee will be created that will seek to declassify and publish
mails of historical or ongoing significance made to the internal private
Debian mailing list.


**Simon Bienlein receives BIENE Award.** [Simon Bienlein](http://www.bienlein.com/) (German), a
German Debian contributor has received the [BIENE award](http://www.biene-award.de/award/) (German). Simon
contributes to the [Debian
installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) and helped to make it fit for use with a braille terminal. He
received the award for his [website](http://www.linux-fuer-blinde.de/) (German) on GNU/Linux for
blind people. The BIENE award is given annually to websites
whose accessibility is exemplary. Simon even received a special award.


**New apt-get and dpkg Guide.** [All about Linux](http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/) a GNU/Linux focused
blog at blogspot.com published a nice [guide](http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2005/12/concise-apt-get-dpkg-primer-for-new.html)
on `apt-get` and `dpkg`. The article is catered for new users and explains
the most common applications of both programs. For more detailed
information on these programs you can also refer to Debian's own [apt howto](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/).


**Using LSB conforming Init Scripts.** Thomas Hood [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01309.html)
how he is supposed to use the [LSB](http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.0.0/) compliant
functions for init scripts properly. He noted that arbitrary output would
spoil the formatting. Petter Reinholdtsen [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01329.html)
about ideas to send the output of scripts to the syslog server. Henrique
Holschuh [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01343.html)
that the functions will even work when parallel init scripts execution is
implemented.


**Individually signed Packages.** Marc Brockschmidt [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01325.html)
about a change in the archive suite that caused individually signed packages
to be rejected. Several people [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01337.html)
that they would like [dpkg-sig](https://packages.debian.org/dpkg-sig) to continue to work. Marc [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01352.html)
that Jörg Jaspert planned to provide a better version of the problematic
check that will accept such packages again.


**TeX Live in Debian?** Norbert Preining [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01649.html)
about the [genesis](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00970.html)
of [TeX live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Debian after the [packages](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01654.html)
have been [rejected](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01651.html)
from the [incoming](http://incoming.debian.org/) directory. Frank
Küster [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01658.html) that several TeX live developers and users wanted a simple way to
install TeX live in Debian, replacing teTeX and keeping dependencies
in order.


**Automatic Bug Closing.** Roberto Sanchez [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00033.html)
if automatic closing of [bugs](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/) could be adjusted to
only work for bugs in the same source package since a typo in the bug number
will cause the wrong bug to be closed. Matthew Palmer [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00037.html)
that the close message does actually state the source package which closes the
bug.


**Debian Sarge updated.** The Debian project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2005/20051220) the first [update](https://people.debian.org/~joey/3.1r1/) for the current [stable](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/) release. Preparations for this
