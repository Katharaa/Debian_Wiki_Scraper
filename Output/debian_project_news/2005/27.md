Debian Weekly News - July 5th, 2005
===================================


Welcome to this year's 27th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. David Nusinow [announced](http://www.livejournal.com/users/gravityboy/14794.html)
Debian [packages](https://people.debian.org/~dnusinow/xorg/) for
X.Org that he also planned to upload into unstable. Norbert Tretkowski has
built [backports](https://people.debian.org/~nobse/xorg-x11/) for
sarge. Rajiv Battula has
published a small [review](http://www.reviewlinux.com/articles/26/1/Debian-3.1-Review)
of Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 in which he demonstrates how simple installing Debian
has become.


**Release Team Meeting.** Andreas Barth sent in the [minutes](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/06/msg00241.html)
of the release team meeting last week. During the meeting they discussed
issues learned from releasing sarge, list release goals for etch and proposed
a timeline. Potential release blockers are the toolchain transition, the
introduction of X.Org, freeing documentation, the archive split, the addition
of amd64 and securing apt.


**Ongoing Installer Development.** Joey Hess [reported](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/d-i_after_sarge-2005-06-28-00-27.html) about his ongoing effort to keep the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) working after the
release. The worst breakage so far has been in [debootstrap](https://packages.debian.org/debootstrap) and the Slang 2
[transition](https://wiki.debian.org/EtchSlang2upgrade) seems to
cause new problems as well. He also referred to the first CD images for
etch, which don't work, though.


**Request for Packaging?** Lars Wirzenius [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/06/msg00299.html)
if RFP (request for packaging) [bugs](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/requested)
are still useful since there are about thousand of them. He mentioned [freshmeat](http://freshmeat.net/) and [gnomefiles](http://www.gnomefiles.org/) as sites where to look for
new stuff to package. As the average age of such requests is about 200 days,
Lars proposed a 365 day maximum age for RFP bugs.


**Structured Program Output.** Olaf van der Spek [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01024.html)
if there were plans to add means to emit structured output for several
command line utilities. He noticed that some fields of the output get
truncated if the corresponding values are too wide. Gabor Gombas [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01118.html)
that those programs are intended to be parsed by humans and that there are
certain other means for programs to gain comprehensible information.


**Ongoing Firefox Trademark Problems.** Eric Dorland [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01160.html)
about the [trademark policy](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy.html) that is not compatible with adding random patches to
Debian packages of Firefox and Thunderbird without infringing their upstream
trademarks. In the long discussion Florian Weimer [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01190.html)
that for PHP and Apache Debian has simply ignored their trademark policy and
considered the software sufficiently free.


**GLADE Transition.** Martin Michlmayr [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01199.html)
to move from [libglade1](https://packages.debian.org/libglade0) to
[libglade2](https://packages.debian.org/libglade2-0) since it has
been orphaned two years ago. Matthew Garrett [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01200.html)
that this would require a transition from GTK1 to GTK2 for all affected
packages. Steve Langasek [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01319.html)
that several packages that use the old library represent libraries for
GNOME 1 that don't have an equivalent for GNOME 2.


**Dealing with offensive Material.** Ralf Hildebrandt [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01388.html)
how to deal with potentially offensive content in a screensaver. Lars
Wirzenius [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01400.html) not to install a screensaver that does more than blank the
screen. Alexander Schmehl [contributed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01435.html) a piece of the Fedora patch that removes potentially offending
words.


**Tilde in Package Versions.** Paul Hampson [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01425.html) if
the tilde symbol may be used in package version now that sarge has been
released. Steve Langasek [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01482.html)
that the required changes have not yet been made to the archive suite (DAK) to
make this possible for etch. Adam Heath [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01483.html)
that DAK uses the symbol as separator internally.


**Sixth annual Debian Conference.** The Debian project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2005/20050705) the sixth annual Debian [conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/0710-debconf) which will be held at
the Computer Science department of the Helsinki University of Technology in
Espoo, Finland from July 9th to July 17th 2005. On the first day, several
developers will [talks](https://www.debconf.org/debconf5/about/debianday) aiming at the general public.
