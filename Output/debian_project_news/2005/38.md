Debian Weekly News - September 20th, 2005
=========================================


Welcome to this year's 38th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. David Moreno Garza [reported](http://damog.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=177) that he has closed 729 [work-needing
and prospective packages bugs](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/) which were more than 600 days old with no hope of
progress. Branden Robinson [posted](http://necrotic.deadbeast.net/~branden/blog/exuberance/Debian/trademark.html) his ideas and thoughts about managing Debian's trademark with
special attention to the [DCC
Alliance](http://www.dccalliance.org/). The [m68k](https://www.debian.org/ports/m68k/) port is in [danger](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/09/msg00139.html)
of being ignored by the testing propagation due to internal compiler errors
and a huge backlog of packages.


**Volunteer Participation in Debian.** A talk about the [evolution of volunteer
participation](http://oss2005.case.unibz.it/Papers/52.pdf) in Debian was held at the [International Conference on Open Source
Systems](http://oss2005.case.unibz.it/). It presents a quantitative research of data of major Debian
releases over the last 7 years, as a case study of volunteer participation in
Free Software projects. The conclusion is that developers tend to maintain
more packages and stay active for a long period of time.


**Removing non-free Documentation.** Frank Lichtenheld [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/09/msg00007.html) how the release team will deal with non-free documentation for
the etch release. The [status](https://release.debian.org/removing-non-free-documentation) of
packages with such files will be tracked with the new usertags feature of the
[bug tracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/). He advised the maintainers
to talk to their upstream authors and document the decisions in bug
reports.


**Honouring the Release Team Work.** Barry Hawkins [looked](http://www.yepthatsme.com/2005/09/13/the-longer-i-manage-a-technical-team-the-more-i-am-in-awe-of-the-debian-release-team/) at how much effort it takes to fix bugs, resolve issues and
maintain the software at work with six developers and 18 dependencies to third
party libraries. In comparison with the 10,000 source packages in Debian and
the coordination and effort required to get a release done the more he is in
awe of the Debian release team.


**Debian-Women Software Freedom Day Activities.** On the
occasion of this year's [Software
Freedom Day](http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/) the [Debian-Women](http://women.alioth.debian.org/)
project was running several [activities](https://lists.debian.org/debian-women/2005/08/msg00189.html)
in order to appeal to all levels of experience: A new IRC channel,
#debian-women-new, was opened
for until then inactive people who would like to get involved with the
Debian-Women project. For more experienced members there was a "help day"
on the usual #debian-women channel. Erinn Clark installed a local BTS, dak
and buildd for people to try out and practice with. Last but not least a
Bug Squashing Party was organised by Hanna Wallach at #debian-bugs. All
three events were well received and many women used the opportunity to
catch up on the Debian-Women project and general Debian development.


**Parallelised Boot Sequence.** Petter Reinholdtsen [restarted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01100.html)
the [discussion](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/initscripts-ng/)
about executing init scripts in parallel and provided a simple patch against
`rc` that will simply execute all scripts with the same priority in
parallel. Based on the [LSB](http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_2.1.0/LSB-generic/LSB-generic/initscrcomconv.html) he [provided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01172.html) an example for a dependency block in init scripts that could be
parsed by future startup programs.


**Improving Init Scripts.** Marc Chantreux [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01451.html)
to write init scripts more efficiently, i.e. by using features the shell and
the used utilities provide. Miquel van Smoorenburg [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01455.html) that only POSIX features should be used. David Weinehall [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01655.html)
that [busybox](https://packages.debian.org/busybox) does not
implement all GNU extensions.


**Closing Bug Reports.** Grzegorz Bizon [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01477.html)
what the preferred way to close bug reports is. Blars Blarson [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01485.html)
that the bug will be automatically closed by the upload when it is mentioned
in the changelog. If it is fixed some other way, or the change has already
been uploaded, the nnn-done address with a version pseudo-header needs to be
used.


**New Maintainer Front Desk Report.** Marc Brockschmidt [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/09/msg00010.html) about significant changes in the [new maintainer](https://nm.debian.org/) process. Contributing to
Debian is now a requirement and lack of it will cause the application to be
removed. The web interface that supports UTF-8 now has also been moved to a
new host and to HTTPS so that secure connections are possible.


**Restricting the GNU GPL.** Harri JÃ¤rvi [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/09/msg00268.html)
that the license of [linuxsampler](https://packages.debian.org/linuxsampler) restricts the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) and explicitly [prohibits](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/09/msg00329.html)
commercial use. Justin Pryzby [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/09/msg00344.html)
if it wouldn't have to be removed since it is linked against a free [library](https://packages.debian.org/libasound2).


**Accidental Distributed Denial of Service Attack.** On
Monday a distributed denial of service attack was [initiated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa/2005/09/msg00018.html) by the security team. They have installed 1.7 GB of
packages with the latest [xfree86](https://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-816)
update. Due to the large number of users and the size of XFree86 packages,
this caused a constant 97 MBit/s output-rate on the security host. There are
ongoing discussions on how to avoid this in the future.


**Publicly exposing the Developer Location?** Robert Lemmen
[proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01529.html) to make public the location of all developers. Ben Armstrong [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01540.html)
that developers have already access to this information, and added that he
would not be happy if the location would be exposed together with his name.
Wolfgang Borgert [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01584.html)
to use a new field instead.
