Debian Weekly News - November 29th, 2005
========================================


Welcome to this year's 48th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Andreas Schuldei sent out a [reminder](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00017.html) for the DebConf call for papers. Martin Krafft [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00019.html) a [bug squashing party](https://wiki.debian.org/BSP)
that lasts until December 14th and rewards 25 bug squashers with a [book](http://debiansystem.info/).


**Possible Freetype Library Transition.** Steve Langasek [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00016.html) that [libfreetype](https://packages.debian.org/libfreetype6) probably requires a transition as well due to upstream [changes](https://bugs.debian.org/314385). There are currently 583
packages in unstable which depend on the libfreetype library, which would
result in the largest transition. He asked library maintainers to improve
their packages by using [libtool](https://packages.debian.org/libtool) and [pkg-config](https://packages.debian.org/pkg-config).


**Improved binary NMU Handling.** Goswin Brederlow [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00018.html) a new behaviour of the archive suite for binary non-maintainer
uploads (NMUs). A [build daemon](https://www.debian.org/devel/buildd/) can thus
be told to rebuild a package as a binary NMU automatically. They will use a
new version scheme and mark such uploads by adding +b1 (+b2, +b3) to the old
version. Manual binary NMUs should best be prepared with the CVS version of
[sbuild](https://packages.debian.org/sbuild).


**Configuration File Handling.** Frank KÃ¼ster [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg01219.html)
if a failing `postinst` script because of changes to a
configuration file that were not accepted by the local admin is considered a
bug, especially if this causes an upgrade to be aborted. Petter Reinholdtsen
[suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00017.html) to implement a multilevel configuration system where local
information are stored in a separate file.


**Versioned Dependencies.** Peter van Eynde [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00093.html)
how he could get rid of a fatal versioned dependency to an architecture
independent package. This causes the [build
daemon](https://www.debian.org/devel/buildd/) to fail building a newer version. Florian Weimer [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00072.html)
to bootstrap the package manually on all supported architectures.


**Virtual Servers with Debian Sarge.** BJ Dierkes wrote a
detailed [description](http://www.howtoforge.com/linux_vserver_debian) about the use of Debian [3.1](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) as a base for several kernel-based [virtual servers](http://www.linux-vserver.org/). This requires to
build a custom kernel with a special vserver patch applied. When the virtual
server is created a new distribution has to be bootstrapped inside.
