Debian Weekly News - November 22nd, 2005
========================================


Welcome to this year's 47th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Nathanael Nerode [observed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg01131.html)
that the new C++ libraries are not transitioning to testing due to a rash of
dependent uploads and has requested that maintainers hold off from uploading
dependent packages that will contribute to the clog. Guillem Jover [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg01195.html)
to [split](https://bugs.debian.org/90989) dependency lines in the
source control files for improved readability. Andreas Tille [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-jr/2005/11/msg00003.html)
about a free [Live CD](http://www.klixxa.de/) aiming at
children.


**Standard C++ Library Modification.** Matthias Klose [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00010.html) that the memory allocator in the standard C++
library will be changed which requires several packages to be rebuilt for
which he has appended a list. The library will be updated by new versions
of the [gcc-3.4](https://packages.debian.org/gcc-3.4) and [gcc-4.0](https://packages.debian.org/gcc-4.0) packages. Maintainers
may have to [rename](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/07/msg00001.html) the binary packages to reflect the new dependency.


**Declassification of private Mails.** Anthony Towns [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/11/msg00001.html)
a general resolution to open the archives of the debian-private list to the
public after three years. A declassification team should be delegated to
extract financial information about individuals and mails of no historical
relevance. Authors and recipients should be given a period to comment on the
publication.


**Project Leader Delegations.** Branden Robinson released a [document](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00009.html) explaining how project leader delegations work. The [constitution](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution) suggests that there may be
other powers which the project leader may not directly wield, and which they
must delegate instead. If a particular decision is delegated, the project
leader cannot take back responsibility for the decision personally, but can
re-delegate it to someone else.


**Debtags Package Search.** Enrico Zini [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00011.html) an experimental search engine for Debian packages on the basis
of [debtags](https://debtags.alioth.debian.org) information. The [search](https://debtags.alioth.debian.org/packagebrowser/faq-search.html) starts with a normal text search, and then continues with
categories. Since it is a prototype the engine is currently slow.


**LCA05: Call for Presentations.** Matthew Palmer [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00013.html) for presentations for the upcoming small [Debian conference](http://miniconf5.debconf.org/) at the 23rd and
24th of January 2006 prior to the [Linux
Conference Australia](http://linux.conf.au/). The topic should be related to Debian and could be
a normal presentation, discussion, tutorial or a story of grand success.


**Automated Testing for Packages.** Ian Jackson [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/11/msg00072.html)
an interface for packages to describe included tests that can be run
automatically. This should help find regressions in more recent versions of
packages. The format shall be RFC822-style again and describe limitations or
side effects as well.


**Debian Developer's Packages Overview.** Christoph Berg [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00015.html) new features for the [packages overview](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php) page.
Arbitrary packages can be added to the page, the system can be configured to
display additional user-defined sections, recently uploaded version are
displayed and data from the [popularity
contest](https://popcon.debian.org/) is included as well.


**No uncompressed Packages Files anymore.** Ian Bruce [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00993.html)
that the Debian package archive doesn't provide uncompressed
`Packages` files anymore. JÃ¶rg Jaspert [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg01082.html)
that this change was [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2002/08/msg00008.html) three years ago already. Goswin Brederlow [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00998.html)
that [apt](https://packages.debian.org/apt) from
`experimental` is able to use the recently provided differential
files.


**Automatic File Updates in Alioth.** Frank KÃ¼ster [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg01014.html)
how files on [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/) could be kept
up-to-date with the Subversion [repository](https://svn.debian.org/)
and already proposed to use a `post-hook`. Enrico Zini [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg01017.html)
his way of updating the web pages by using a mail trigger and an anonymous
checkout area.


**Descriptions for Dummy and Meta Packages.** Enrico Zini [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg01154.html)
for consistent descriptions for meta and dummy packages so that they aren't
tagged wrongly and future package managers can handle them properly. A
metapackage is used to pull in other packages. On the contrary, a dummy
package is used for smooth upgrades of packages and can safely be removed
afterwards.


**PHP License Status.**. Jeremy Bouse [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/10/msg00124.html)
for clarification regarding the [PHP licenses](http://www.php.net/license/3_0.txt) as to whether or not they qualify as free since many PEAR
packages use them. Steve Langasek [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/10/msg00125.html)
that the licenses itself are considered free but not suitable for anything
which is not PHP.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
