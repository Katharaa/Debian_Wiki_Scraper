Debian Weekly News - September 6th, 2005
========================================


Welcome to this year's 36th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Christoph Berg [created](https://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa/2005/08/msg00020.html) a Debian [quiz](http://www.df7cb.de/debian/quiz/) where
you can test your knowledge about Debian's distribution, people, mailing
lists, etc. So far, about 1600 people have participated. After their summer
holidays 16,000 pupils in northern Italy (south Tyrol) will find their 2,460
classroom computers [migrated](http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS2079183879.html) to a
customised, multi-language [derivative](http://www.fuss.bz.it/) of
Debian GNU/Linux.


**KDE Transition Status.** Adeodato SimÃ³ [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/09/msg00000.html) that the archive now contains versions of qt-x11-free, aRts, and
kdelibs for all architectures that depend on the new C++ library. Therefore
he asked developers to update the packages that depend on one of these
libraries and enclosed a list of maintainers and packages.


**License for Wiki Content.** Geert Stappers [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/08/msg00070.html)
which license should be used for the [content](http://faiwiki.informatik.uni-koeln.de/) of a Wiki system,
which is intended to be modified and improved by others. Nathanael Nerode [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/08/msg00078.html)
that Debian is working with the [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/) people on a draft of a new version of their license that
should be DFSG-free,
since the current one isn't. Andrew Suffield [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/08/msg00101.html)
to use the MIT license unless there is a really good reason not to do so.


**Using the PHP License for Packages.** Charles Fry [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/08/msg00190.html)
that the current version of the [PHP
license](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2005/36/www.php.net/license/3_0.txt) (version 3.0) contains several clauses which are specific to the
PHP language, and either inapplicable or even problematic for applications
written in PHP. Francesco Poli [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/08/msg00233.html)
to use the 2-clause BSD license and use the PHP license only for PHP
itself.


**Curl reverts to OpenSSL.** Domenico Andreoli [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00314.html)
that he has paused the plan to link [curl](https://packages.debian.org/libcurl3) library against [GNU TLS](https://packages.debian.org/libgnutls11) instead of [OpenSSL](https://packages.debian.org/libssl0.9.7) which he considered
after license concerns. The upstream developer was [not
happy](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00367.html) to restrict the binary packages to either library since their
implementations contain partially different features.


**Purging Database Data?** Philipp Kern [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00318.html)
under which circumstances user-supplied data should be removed upon package
removal. Joey Hess [confirmed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00390.html)
that using debconf during `postrm` purge is fine as long as the
script checks whether [debconf](https://packages.debian.org/debconf)
is installed and falls back to reasonable behaviour if it isn't.


**New Runlevel Design.** Timo Aaltonen [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00596.html)
if there were plans to change the runlevel concept more into the direction of
the [Linux Standard Base](http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/runlevels.html). John Hasler [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00609.html)
that most probably there won't be a change into supporting multiple multi-user
runlevels. Hamish Moffatt [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00689.html)
the emergency mode which is what several people [expect](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00613.html)
as single-user mode.


**Notification on API Changes.** Marc Brockschmidt [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00660.html)
developers to notify others when the application program interface (API) is
changed in a new version. Ron Johnson [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00669.html) that `apt-rdepends` works fine for normal reverse
dependencies. Kurt Roeckx [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00784.html) a
means to discover the reverse build-dependencies of a package.


**Quality of the README File.** Wolfgang Borgert [gave](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00705.html)
several examples of confusing, irrelevant, redundant, or useless
`README` files distributed in Debian packages. He asked
maintainers to not include the upstream `README` file in the binary
package, if it's not really important to the user and strip irrelevant
information otherwise.


**Differing Library Memory Consumption.** Stephane Chauveau [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/08/msg00076.html)
that a self-compiled GTK library consumes less (140 kB) memory for
non-static data than the one provided by Debian. Thiemo Seufer [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01556.html)
that this does not matter due to copy-on-write done by the kernel. The reason
for this is still unknown.


**Debian QA Meeting.** Martin Zobel-Helas [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/08/msg00085.html)
about the Debian QA [meeting](http://wiki.ftbfs.de/ftbfs/DebianQaMeeting) that will take place at the Technical University of Darmstadt from
the 9th to the 11th of September. The attendants will give talks on various
topics such as portability issues, the installer, lintian, autotools, new
maintainer, collaborative maintenance and others.
