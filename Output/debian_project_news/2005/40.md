Debian Weekly News - October 4th, 2005
======================================


Welcome to this year's 40th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Donald Feinberg, vice-president of Gartner [predicted](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1242282.cms)
the end of Unix in 10-15 years and the rise of GNU/Linux. Debian GNU/Linux is
used as a server [running](http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php?id=861607645)
several open source products for analytics at the Australian Taxation
Office.


**DPL Team Status Issue Tracker.** Andreas Schuldei [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/09/msg00200.html)
a Wiki [page](https://wiki.debian.org/DPLTeamCurrentIssues) in order
to maintain transparency of the scud [team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/03/msg00035.html)
since they did not have formal meetings and minutes for a longer time. The
list includes funding, hardware and hosting requests, communications issues
and more.


**Release Team Changes.** Colin Watson [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/09/msg00164.html)
his resignation from the release team due to his time constraints. To let the
release team benefit from his experience, he's going to stay in the team but
merely as an engineer. A new release manager will be added to the team soon
in order to fill the gap.


**Work Needed and Prospective Packages.** David Moreno Garza
[reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/09/msg00014.html) that in total 979 [wnpp](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/) bugs
have been closed in several investigation runs. Requests for packages and
intentions to submit packages that are older than a year and haven't seen any
significant activity were removed by this action. He will repeat this process
automatically in the future.


**Debian Network Introduction.** Steve Kemp wrote a basic [introduction](https://www.debian-administration.org/articles/254) into
the network setup with Debian GNU/Linux. The article includes setting the
hostname and IP address, setting up DNS, gives a short introduction into
routing and explains hostname lookup.


**New teTeX 3.0 Packages for Debian.** Frank KÃ¼ster [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/09/msg00015.html) that a new major version of teTeX will be uploaded to unstable
when library transitions are allowed again. He asked developers of packages
that maintain a connection to [teTeX](https://packages.debian.org/tetex-bin) to test these with the
new version of teTeX in order to avoid problems later.


**Debian Meeting Archive.** Holger Levsen [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/09/msg00016.html) a permanent Debian meeting [archive](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/)
that contains audio and video files as well as slides and example codes from
various real-life Debian meetings. It currently hosts [videos](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2005/qa-meeting-darmstadt/) and slides from the Debian QA meeting in Darmstadt, [videos](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2005/debconf5/) from this year's Debian conference in Helsinki and [slides](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2005/linuxtag-karlsruhe/) from the Debian Day at this year's LinuxTag in Karlsruhe.


**Resume from the Darmstadt QA Team Meeting.** Andreas Barth [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/09/msg00017.html) about the productive [meeting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/08/msg00085.html) of
the QA team in Darmstadt, Germany. Major results include the removal of very
old and unused packages. There have also been discussions about how to
support external contributors and how to make packages more independent of
each other by using plugins with stable interfaces.


**Dropping non-SMP Kernels for IA64?** Dann Frazier [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-ia64/2005/09/msg00040.html)
if kernel images for [IA64](https://www.debian.org/ports/ia64/) machines without
symmetric multi processing (SMP) could be dropped from the distribution. He
asserted that all current IA64 machines on the market are capable of SMP.
Supporting such flavours is difficult because such configurations don't seem
to get much attention upstream.


**Planet Debian versus Mailing Lists.** Wolfgang Borgert [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01203.html) how to filter important Debian development information from
[Planet Debian](https://planet.debian.org). Margarita Manterola [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01219.html)
that it is part of the essence of blogging to state ones opinion and not be
easily flamed for it like on a mailing list. She also agreed that sharing
important development information should be done on the [lists](https://lists.debian.org/).


**Future of the S/390 Port.** Gerhard Tonn [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01234.html)
that he won't be able to work on the [S/390
port](https://www.debian.org/ports/s390/) anymore and is looking for a successor, who is willing to take over
the administration of the buildd servers, analysing build failures and work on
the [requalification](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/09/msg00012.html) of this port for the etch release. Bastian Blank [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-s390/2005/09/msg00035.html)
his willingness to take over the port.


**Special Input Event Device Files.** Frank Lichtenheld [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00512.html)
how [pbbuttonsd](https://packages.debian.org/pbbuttonsd) should [handle](https://bugs.debian.org/324604) more than four event device
files that are automatically created by [makedev](https://packages.debian.org/makedev). Marco d'Itri [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00513.html) to just educate the user if they are not using [udev](https://packages.debian.org/udev) already. Christoph Hellwig,
though, [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00514.html) that `makedev` should just create all 32 device nodes.
