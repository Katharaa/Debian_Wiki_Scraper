Debian Weekly News - September 13th, 2005
=========================================


Welcome to this year's 37th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Wouter Verhelst [noticed](http://www.grep.be/blog/2005/08/17#new_bugs.d.o) that the [bug tracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/) has gotten a new layout and even
uses cascading style sheets like the main [website](https://www.debian.org/). In
an article Ian Murdock [suggested](http://ianmurdock.com/?p=239)
Debian to concentrate on a tight release cycle and keeping the growing family
of Debian derivatives united.


**Debian UK Society.** In March Steve McIntyre [announced](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/debian-uk/2005-March/002526.html) plans to found the [Debian UK Society](http://wiki.earth.li/DebianUKSociety). There have
been some [resentments](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/09/msg00000.html) against it and against [selling](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/09/msg00073.html)
items at exhibitions, though, leading to a large discussion. Branden Robinson
already [worked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/08/msg00280.html)
on a revocable trademark license grant for Debian's name and logos usable by
any local charitable affiliates.


**Value of Debian GNU/Linux.** The paper [Measuring
Libre Software](http://www.upgrade-cepis.org/issues/2005/3/up6-3Amor.pdf) studying the size of the source packages in Debian 3.1
calculates the size of sarge (close to 230 million lines of source code), the
use of the various programming languages in which the software has been
written, and the size of the packages included in the distribution. It also
estimates cost to create something on the scale of Debian from scratch with a
classical and well-known cost method (COCOMO) to be over 8 billion US
dollar.


**Supporting Testing Security.** Joey Hess [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/09/msg00006.html) the beginning of full security support for Debian's testing
distribution. The Debian testing security team has spent the past year
building the team and creating infrastructure. Advisories for security fixes
will only be [announced](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/secure-testing-announce) for updates that are made available through the new repository
and don't reach testing through normal propagation from unstable.


**Team Maintenance.** Wolfgang Borgert [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00712.html)
as a conclusion of many discussions at [DebConf5](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/0710-debconf) to maintain all packages
by teams and start projects at [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/).
John Goerzen liked the idea but [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00758.html)
to move towards a more BSD approach, where any developer can commit changes to
any package.


**Old Documentation Links.** Joey Hess [identified](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00744.html)
497 packages that still contain code in their `postinst` script to
create links in `/usr/doc/` which should have been a bug since
2002. Recompiling most of them with a current version of [debhelper](https://packages.debian.org/debhelper) will remove that
code. Henning Makholm [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00747.html)
that several of these packages have been orphaned without changing their
maintainer field to the QA team.


**Planet Debian via Mailing List?** Christoph Berg [requested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00799.html)
a [mailing list](https://bugs.debian.org/323227) to distribute the
aggregated content of [Planet Debian](https://planet.debian.org/).
Providing that service would recognise the relevance of Planet Debian to the
Debian culture. Tollef Fog Heen, however, didn't [want](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01069.html) his
feed to end up in a public mail archive somewhere.


**Executable Example Files.** JÃ¶rg Sommer [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00829.html)
an example file to be [executable](https://bugs.debian.org/281892).
Clint Adams argued that the file must reside in `/usr/bin` to be
executable. Marcelo Magallon [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00831.html)
to write a wrapper script that will execute the example instead.


**Debian Package Sponsor Platform.** Neil McGovern [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00899.html)
[sponsors.debian.net](http://sponsors.debian.net/) that intends to
help prospective Debian developers to find a sponsor for the packages they
maintain. The site supports automatic updates of intent-to-package bugs when
the package has been uploaded and notification of maintainers when a package
has been sponsored.


**Beta Version Package Versioning.** Lars Bahner [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00956.html)
that the final version of a package is considered a lower version number than
the beta version and wondered how to cope with it. Robert Collins [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01099.html)
to use the low-priority tilde delimiter in such cases, although for the
current version this is too [late](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01102.html)
already and it is also not yet [available](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01106.html).


**Source-only Package Uploads.** Sven Luther [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01125.html)
all packages to be built by the buildd network. Wouter Verhelst [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01150.html)
that many developers would not even test their packages when source-only
uploads were permitted. Henrique Holschuh had the [idea](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01165.html) to
work around this by throwing away the maintainer-supplied packages and letting
a buildd compile them again.


**Usertags for Bug Reports.** Anthony Towns [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/09/msg00002.html) the availability of [user tags](https://wiki.debian.org/bugs.debian.org/usertags) for the
[bug tracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/) and explained uses and ways to
display bugs according to the supplied tags. Marc Brockschmidt [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/09/msg00032.html) such
tags in order to be able to track QA related bugs easier.
