Debian Weekly News - July 26th, 2005
====================================


Welcome to this year's 30th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. The hosting offer for two important Debian machines ended
and they are being temporarily [relocated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/07/msg00013.html) to [HP](http://www.hp.com/), resulting in a temporary
downtime of several services. Lars Wirzenius [reported](http://liw.iki.fi/liw/log/2005-07.html#20050719b) that [piuparts](https://packages.debian.org/piuparts), a testing utility for
Debian packages, has been added to the archive.


**Greylisting for Debian Hosts.** Santiago Vila would like the
project to [consider](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01550.html) using greylisting, a technique to delay mails, on
Debian hosts. Rich Walker [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01624.html) that some mail servers can't cope with such delays. Florian
Weimer [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01704.html) that zombie software that is locked out with greylisting will
probably be improved in the future, leaving greylisting without effect. Marc
Haber [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01697.html) that [exim](https://packages.debian.org/exim) runs the
queue every 30 minutes, which would be a significant delay for many users.


**Setting the CPU Frequency Policy.** Mattia Dongili [pondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00026.html)
setting a default governor for the CPU frequency on boot during the
`rc.S` stage in order to set the policy early during the boot
process. Bernd Eckenfels [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00768.html)
that setting it early during startup doesn't help since reducing the CPU
frequency during boot is not useful and having the CPU run at full speed for a
short moment won't drain the battery.


**Potential Debconf Abuse.** JÃ¶rg Sommer [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00114.html)
if using debconf to ask about the default look for an editor would be abuse.
Hamish Moffatt [pondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00139.html)
whether it is necessary to ask such a question when there is a sensible
default. Petter Reinholdtsen [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00140.html)
to use priority `low` but then there's not much point in [asking](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00146.html)
it at all.


**Automatic Password Generation.** Olaf van der Spek [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00209.html)
how to tell the admin about a newly generated password to access a daemon on
their system. The best method would probably be to store it in a
configuration file in `/etc` as John Hasler [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00210.html) and protect it from unauthorised persons by using sane
permissions.


**Multi-Architecture Proposal.** Nikita Youshchenko [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00232.html)
about the status of the [multi architecture](http://raw.no/debian/amd64-multiarch-2) proposal. While this is not required to support the
pure amd64 port which is going to be integrated into Debian, it is a
requirement for supporting sparc64, s390x, mips64, mipsel64 and powerpc64. It
is [planned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00354.html) to provide only a limited number of packages for native 64-bit use
on these architectures instead of the entire archive.


**Debian Logo Font.** Andreas Tille [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00251.html)
if the font used on the Debian [logo](https://www.debian.org/logos/) is available
as TeX font as well and could be used for the "Debian-Med" sign.
JÃ¶rg Friedrich [mentioned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00256.html) the [wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianLogo)
with more details and contributed a [mail](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2003/08/msg00261.html) by
Gerfried Fuchs that revealed [Poppl
Laudatio Condensed](http://www.identifont.com/show?U5) as used font.


**Bug Mail Subscription.** Joachim Breitner [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00490.html)
a new bug subscription feature of the [bug tracking
system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/) (BTS). During [DebConf](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/0710-debconf) the feature was integrated into the BTS and the listserver. It is
now [possible](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/07/msg00014.html) to [subscribe](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#subscribe) and
unsubscribe to individual bug reports. This
also works for non-existing bug numbers.


**Changed Program Behaviour.** Matt Kraai [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00614.html)
that the behaviour of [texi2html](https://packages.debian.org/texi2html) has changed recently. The new version will place the generated
HTML files in a sub-directory when it is asked to split by chapter. This will
cause several packages to fail during their building stage.


**Debian QA Meeting.** Martin Zobel-Helas [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/07/msg00123.html) a
[QA team](https://qa.debian.org/) meeting taking place from the 9th
to the 11th of September in Darmstadt, Germany. He noted that the group is
already maintaining about 265 packages that have accumulated around 633 bugs.
The aim of this meeting is to fix long outstanding bugs, improve the QA
infrastructure and work on documentation.


**Debian Conference ends in a Success.** The Debian project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2005/20050724) that this year's [Debian Conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/0710-debconf) was a great
success with more than 300 people attending and over 20 sponsors. One
highlight was the presentation about the large-scale deployment of 80,000
Debian workstations in Extremadura, Spain. The presentations were captured by
the video team and are available [online](http://dc5video.debian.net/).


**Debtags finally integrated.** Enrico Zini [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/07/msg00016.html) that `Packages` files recently started to include [debtags](http://debtags.alioth.debian.org) information that others
had already [noticed](http://blog.drinsama.de/erich/en/linux/debian/2005071901-tags-in-packages). The tag information can be browsed [online](http://debian.vitavonni.de/packagebrowser) and edited with
either [debtags-edit](https://packages.debian.org/debtags-edit) or
[tagcolledit](https://packages.debian.org/tagcolledit).

that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
