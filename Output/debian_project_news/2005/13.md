Debian Weekly News - March 29th, 2005
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 13th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. James Troup [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/03/msg00142.html) the addition of two developers to the ftpmaster team, who will
work on new packages in particular. Rob Bradford eventually [announced](http://www.robster.org.uk/blog/2005/03/20#founding-20050320) the founding of a an Debian UK society that will deal with
donations in the UK.


**Debian-Installer RC3 released.** Joey Hess [announced](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/News/2005/20050323) the third release candidate of the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/). The most
significant change in this release are updated versions of all kernels that
include numerous security fixes. The partitioner has also been improved with
regards to other operating systems.


**New Mailing Lists created.** Pascal Hakim [announced](http://www.redellipse.net/stuff/Debian/Lists/new-list-day.story)
the creation of a few lists. There are three new
localisation lists ([debian-l10n-arabic](https://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-arabic), [debian-l10n-czech](https://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-czech), and [debian-l10n-korean](https://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-korean)), as
well as two new infrastructure lists. [debian-testing-changes](https://lists.debian.org/debian-testing-changes)
will be used to show changes to the testing distribution, while [debian-dak](https://lists.debian.org/debian-dak) will be used for
discussion relating to dak and buildd related components.


**Election Resources.** David Schmitt [published](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/03/msg00829.html)
a [summary](http://debian.edv-bus.at/vote-2005/) of the questions
asked and answers given by the 2005 [project leader candidates](https://www.debian.org/vote/2005/vote_001) during the election campaign. Thaddeus H. Black
also [distilled](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/03/msg00848.html) a semantical [transcript](http://home.ntelos.net/~b-tk/vote/2005/Log-debian-dpl-debate-reordered.html) from the live 2005 DPL debate's [chronological log](https://www.debian.org/vote/2005/Log-debian-dpl-debate),
organised for coherent reading the questions, answers and discussions of the
debate's second part.


**Build-Dependency against libtool 1.4.** Andrew Pollock [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/03/msg00075.html)
that five packages still declare a build-dependency against [libtool 1.4](https://packages.debian.org/libtool1.4) which is orphaned
and will be [removed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/03/msg00077.html).
Frank Lichtenheld [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/03/msg00078.html) to
open bug reports against packages that use libtool 1.4 files to upgrade to
version 1.5 which was [considered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/03/msg00079.html)
a good idea. Henrique de Moraes Holschuh also [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/03/msg00081.html)
to force the use of newer [libtool](https://packages.debian.org/libtool), [autoconf](https://packages.debian.org/autoconf) and [gettext](https://packages.debian.org/gettext) utilities.


**Quality Assurance Hacking Event.** Luk Claes [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/03/msg00084.html)
to organise an official QA hacking work camp in Helsinki right before the
Debian conference. This would consist of bug fixing for [lintian](https://packages.debian.org/lintian) and [linda](https://packages.debian.org/linda), removing obsolete packages
from the archive, cleaning up [WNPP pages](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/),
fixing bugs in QA group maintained packages and of other subjects within the
scope of the QA group.


**Finishing a foreign ITP.** Shachar Shemesh [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2005/03/msg00259.html)
that an [Intent to package](https://bugs.debian.org/269329) (ITP)
for [Open Xchange](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)
hasn't seen any progress and wondered what to do in case he had packaged the
software on his own. Matthew Palmer [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2005/03/msg00260.html)
to add a note to the bug report and offer help before actually uploading the
package.


**Spelling Correction for Package Descriptions.** Florian
Zumbiehl [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/03/msg01170.html) another common mistake that developers make in package
descriptions. He added a list of words, which are mostly acronyms, where "a"
and "an" are often used wrongly. Joey Hess [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/03/msg01173.html) that some acronyms such as FAQ are ambiguous, since they can be pronounced
differently.


**PHP and derived Works.** The PHP licenses have been [investigated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/02/msg00222.html) with regards to distributing derived works. Francesco Poli
[pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/02/msg00346.html) that [PHP 3](https://packages.debian.org/php3) is
dual-licensed with the [GNU
GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). The [license](https://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/p/php4/php4_4.3.10-10/php4.copyright) for PHP 4 contains a paragraph that prohibits derived work to
be called PHP or contain the word PHP in the name. Andi Gutmans [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/03/msg00169.html)
that minor changes and security fixes are no problem and that [Apache](https://packages.debian.org/apache) is licensed the same
way.


**CD/DVD Images Release Progress.** Steve McIntyre sent in a [summary](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/03/msg00013.html) of the release progress from the CD team. Since the disk space
has been increased on [cdimage.debian.org](https://cdimage.debian.org/) it can host full images for woody and sarge for a
period after the release. Due to the sheer amount of sarge more than one
binary DVD image will be produced per architecture. The list of prospective
images and files contain Torrents and Jigdo files, of course.


**Low Voter Turnout.** In the second [call](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/03/msg00026.html) for votes on the current project leader [election](https://www.debian.org/vote/2005/vote_001) Manoj Srivastava reported that
we have the lowest participation ever in a project leader election since
tracking voting rates. In an [interview](http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/0,2000061733,39186281,00.htm) he assumed that several developers are disillusioned after the
[changes](https://www.debian.org/vote/2004/vote_003) of the [social contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract), the problems with AMD64
and the [Vancouver prospectus](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/03/msg00012.html).


**Marcus Brinkmann on Hurd/L4.** In an [interview](http://portal.wikinerds.org/brinkmann-interview-mar2005)
Marcus Brinkmann explained the Hurd and that the Mach microkernel was
discarded as basis because of poor virtual memory management. Instead, the
new goal was to port the Hurd to the L4 microkernel which has reached the step
of being able to [execute](http://portal.wikinerds.org/gnu-hurd-l4-first-program)
programs recently. The interview gives a lot of insight into
different areas as well.
