Debian Weekly News - November 1st, 2005
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 44th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Nathanael Nerode [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00388.html)
that current GCC versions support the old i386 processor again and hence
Debian could retain i386 compatibility in the upcoming [etch release](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/).


**Calculating Development Package Dependencies.** Jay
Berkenbilt [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00184.html) to work on a [debhelper](https://packages.debian.org/debhelper) script that helps
calculating [libtool](https://packages.debian.org/libtool)
dependencies for development packages. Goswin von Brederlow [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00519.html) that with [multiarch](http://raw.no/debian/amd64-multiarch-2) there may be concurrent `.la` files to handle. No
consensus in favour of such a script was reached. Junichi Uekawa (上川 純一)
[mentioned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00316.html) the [d-shlibs](https://packages.debian.org/d-shlibs)
package that contains scripts to support the maintainer in this regard.


**New OpenSSL Package.** Christoph Martin has uploaded a new
upstream version of [OpenSSL](https://packages.debian.org/openssl)
and Aurelien Jarno [provided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00383.html) a list of more than 300 packages that will have to be rebuilt.
Jonas Meurer [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00372.html)
maintainer names to it. Henrique Holschuh [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00226.html)
for versioned symbols for this library since it would cure the problem of
linking against more than one version of the library.


**Berlinux Event Report.** Meike Reichle wrote a [report](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/1021-berlinux-report) about the [Berlinux](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/1021-berlinux) exhibition and
conference that took place in Berlin, Germany at the end of last month.
Members of the Debian project ran a booth and gave several talks that were
directly or indirectly related to Debian. The booth featured a Debian
controlled model railway from Frank Ronneburg and a Nokia 770 from Wolfgang
Borgert.


**Effort to alter RFC Licensing.** Simon Josefsson [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00214.html)
an [effort](http://josefsson.org/bcp78broken/) to influence the [IETF](http://www.ietf.org/) to change the copying conditions on RFCs
to make them more Free Software friendly. He is looking for signatures from
Free Software developers to support his proposed license change.


**Automatic Building Kernel Modules.** Russ Allbery [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00273.html)
how to deal with a [request](https://bugs.debian.org/168852) against
the [openafs-modules-source](https://packages.debian.org/openafs-modules-source) to automatically build kernel modules when the
kernel is updated. Building kernel modules separately from the source package
is a very bad idea since they can't be easily updated by the security team.
Andres Salomon [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00382.html)
that the infrastructure for a package to build `-source` packages
hasn't been implemented yet.


**Automatic Test Suite Results Forwarding.** Florian Ragwitz
[wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00426.html) how a package could emit the results of the test suite to the
upstream developers. The test suite is run during the build stage of the
package and is a helpful resource for the developers. Daniel Jacobowitz [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00428.html)
to display the results during the build so they will end up in the build logs,
which are publicly available.


**GTK+ Icon Cache Discussion.** Josselin Mouette is [seeking](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00455.html)
input on handling icons caches in the GTK+ library since traversing the entire
directory tree is time consuming. When the cache is not rebuilt for recently
added icons, the corresponding programs can't start as usual.


**Postinst Check for Package Status.** Frank KÃ¼ster [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00463.html)
if there is an established method for the `postinst` script to
determine the status of another package in order to prevent a second
invocation of a time [consuming](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00467.html) program. He [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00655.html)
that the Zope packages already try to implement a general post-hook mechanism
with APT. Ben Armstrong [quoted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00470.html) a
snippet from the [libc6](https://packages.debian.org/libc6)
`postinst` that solves the original problem.


**GNOME Meta Package Dependencies.** Arthur Edwards [complained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00468.html) about the [gnome](https://packages.debian.org/gnome)
meta package depending on the [gnome-games](https://packages.debian.org/gnome-games) package since in
some government environments games are prohibited. Ben Armstrong [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00475.html)
that one doesn't benefit from future goodies if the meta package is removed,
even though it is not essential.
