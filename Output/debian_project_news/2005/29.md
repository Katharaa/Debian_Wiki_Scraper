Debian Weekly News - July 19th, 2005
====================================


Welcome to this year's 29th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. By the time that this issue is released, this year's [Debian conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/0710-debconf) in Finland
will have finished. About 270 people gathered for nearly three weeks in
Helsinki forming a nice [group
photo](http://aigarius.blogspot.com/2005/07/debconf5-group-photo.html). During the conference [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/) has been [upgraded](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/07/msg00174.html)
to Debian sarge with several improvements included.


**Plans for new Debian-CDs.** Steve McIntyre [summarised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/07/msg00005.html) the goals and plans for the next version of [debian-cd](https://packages.debian.org/debian-cd). The handling of
tasks and dependencies needs to be improved. They want to improve the layout
code so that packages are copied faster and to simplify the task of creating
different layouts, like multi-arch or combined binary/source.


**Debian GNU/Hurd Status Update.** Michael Banck [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/07/msg00006.html) that Debian GNU/Hurd is alive and kicking, though it could do with
some more help. About 40 % of all Debian packages are built for the Hurd
and a buildd is waiting for inclusion into the archive system. The core
packages are maintained by a team and coordination of this port is organised
via [Alioth](http://debian-hurd.alioth.debian.org/).


**Library Updates for the C++ ABI Change.** Steve Langasek [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/07/msg00007.html) that C++ libraries have to be renamed without a soname change
during the transition to GCC 4.0 with a different application binary interface
(ABI). He also warned developers not to upload libraries before the C++
libraries they depend on have successfully made the transition and are built
on all architectures.


**Expanding the Release Team.** Andreas Barth is [looking](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/07/msg00009.html) for new release assistants to better distribute the workload
during the development cycle for etch that just started. Applicants need to
be Debian developers, have a lot of spare time to dedicate, worked on QA and
understand general programming and scripting languages as well as Debian
packaging. He also emphasised that this is a grunt work position.


**Tracking Distributions and Versions.** Colin Watson [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/07/msg00010.html) a large-scale modification of the [bug
tracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/) that allows to track versions and distributions that are
affected by particular bugs. Reporters can now add particular version to
which a bug applies and close bugs with regards to specific versions. As a
result, the meaning of distribution-specific tags has changed.


**Maintaining orphaned Packages.** Raphaël Hertzog [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/07/msg00035.html) to
maintain orphaned packages with a small user base on [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/) and to hand out write access to
those interested in them, even when they don't want to become their official
maintainers. Basically he would like to [start](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/07/msg00102.html)
a QA task force that actively maintains such packages with a lot of external
input.


**Debian Printing Group.** Roger Leigh [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg02199.html)
to form a printing group inside Debian in order to coordinate the various
printing packages. Due to the numerous ways of setting up a working printing
system, bugs in one package are often in interdependent packages. As a
result, the [debian-printing](https://lists.debian.org/debian-printing/) list has been [created](https://lists.debian.org/debian-printing/2005/07/msg00000.html).


**SSH Default Setting changed.** Marco d'Itri [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00023.html)
that the default setting of `HashKnownHosts` has been set to
`yes` in sid which results in all new host addresses to be hashed.
They are not human-readable anymore. Florian Weimer [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00027.html)
that this setting reduces the chance for worms to abuse the
`known_hosts` file. Colin Watson [quoted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00045.html)
the documentation of `ssh-keygen` that will help remove old
entries.
