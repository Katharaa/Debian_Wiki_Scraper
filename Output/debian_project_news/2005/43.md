Debian Weekly News - October 25th, 2005
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 43rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. JÃ¶rg Jaspert [noticed](http://ganneff.de/blog/2005/10/23) that the rate of package [rejections](https://ftp-master.debian.org/REJECT-FAQ.html) out of the
NEW queue is rising, mostly due to incomplete `copyright` files and
suggested to investigate the included files before the upload. Debian users
in Japan will hold Debian [mini
conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/1028-jdmc) in Osaka, Japan at the coming weekend (28th and 29th of
October).


**Etch Release Progress.** Steve Langasek [thanked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/10/msg00004.html) those who have spent large amounts of time on the [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) release and proposed a timeline for
the release of [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/). This allows for the
first freeze of the toolchain and kernel in July and a general freeze in
October. Meeting these milestones would then lead to a [release](https://release.debian.org/etch_rc_policy.txt) of etch in
December 2006.


**Graphical Debian-Installer.** Christian Perrier [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2005/10/msg00980.html)
about the [graphical frontend](https://debian.polito.it/downloads/d-i_gtk_snapshots/) to the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) as part of the most recent [minutes](https://people.debian.org/~bubulle/d-i/irc-meeting-20051019/minutes) of the monthly Debian Installer team [meeting](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Meetings). Davide
Viti earlier [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2005/10/msg00406.html) a nearly working graphical installer and a small [ISO image](https://people.debian.org/~fjp/d-i/images/daily/gtk-miniiso/mini.iso) for trial.


**Port Assignments during System Boot.** Gernot Salzer [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01062.html)
that some network ports get assigned dynamically during the boot process and
sometimes clash with daemons that use fixed ports. Javier FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino
PeÃ±a [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01071.html) that the assignment happens inside the GNU C library and [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01148.html)
the `portsreserve` package to prevent such cases.


**Default local Hostname.** Christoph Haas [discovered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01063.html)
that the local hostname after the installation defaults to
`localhost.localdomain` instead of just `localhost`.
Joey Hess [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00254.html) that the configuration has already been changed after the sarge
release in reaction to Bug#[247734](https://bugs.debian.org/247734).


**Plus Signs in Package Names.** Andres Salomon [intended](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01290.html) to rename the binary packages of [mysql++](https://packages.debian.org/src:mysql++) package from [libsqlplus1](https://packages.debian.org/libsqlplus1) to [libmysql++](https://packages.debian.org/libmysql++2) since several
users were confused by the older name and wondered if the plus signs could
pose a problem for the packaging tools. Henning Glawe [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00081.html) that the plus sign has a special meaning for `apt-get` but
Henning Makholm [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00083.html)
that this doesn't matter here since the soname will have to be added to it
anyway.


**S-Lang Module Naming.** Rafael Laboissiere [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01291.html)
that there is currently no policy about naming S-Lang modules. Applications
such as [slsh](https://packages.debian.org/slsh) or [slrn](https://packages.debian.org/slrn) are prefixed with
"`sl`" while modules for other languages use the full name of the
language in the package name. He [acknowledged](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01309.html) to rename the package to [slang-gdbm](https://packages.debian.org/slang-gdbm) as this module is
more interesting for S-Lang developers.


**Pbuilder Status Update.** Junichi Uekawa (上川 純一)
[reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01317.html)
that he has moved the development to [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pbuilder) as a preparation
for team maintenance and switched to [cdebootstrap](https://packages.debian.org/cdebootstrap). For several
distributions dependencies are not [resolved](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01450.html)
with regards to priorities, though. They could be adjusted [en bloc](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00035.html)
or [during](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00052.html) the entire development cycle before the release.


**Proposed teTeX Transition.** Frank KÃ¼ster [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01349.html)
if there is a possibility to prevent a normal transition for teTeX packages
since the new version 3.0 should be available in unstable but release managers
have asked him not to start another transition at the moment. Andreas Barth
[agreed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01353.html) that providing the old library version for a while would help and
not block packages as usual.


**New uClibc Ports.** Daniel Ruoso is [interested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01362.html)
in an i386 port of Debian based on the uClibc instead of the GNU C library for
older and slower hardware. Simon Richter is in [need](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01367.html) of
a big endian ARM port using uClibc for embedded systems and proposed to
exchange only a small set of packages with their uClibc versions. Riku Voipio
[pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01449.html) to the [woody](https://people.debian.org/~andersee/uwoody/) port using uClibc.


**cURL Status Update.** Domenico Andreoli [updated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01389.html)
the cURL package in the experimental suite so that one variant is linked
against OpenSSL and another is linked against GNU TLS. This will fix license
problems with applications released under the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) that are indirectly
linked against OpenSSL.


**PHP License for PEAR Packages?** Piotr Roszatycki [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00122.html)
how to handle packages in the Debian archive that use the [PHP](http://www.php.net/license/2_02.txt) [license](http://www.php.net/license/3_0.txt) for something that is
not PHP itself since one such package was rejected from the archive. JÃ¶rg
Jaspert [pointed out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/08/msg00128.html) that the license isn't suited for modules and applications
written in or for PHP but only for the core PHP language itself.


**New Source Packages and Binaries.** Frank KÃ¼ster [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00153.html)
that a new source package that provides existing binary package does not have
to go through NEW processing. This way accidentally overwritten binary packages
won't get noticed before they reach the archive. Jeroen van Wolffelaar [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00187.html)
that this will soon change.
