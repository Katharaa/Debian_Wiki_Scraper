Debian Weekly News - April 26th, 2005
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 17th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. According to analyst house IDC, Free Software is [gaining](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/18/oss_gains_in_europe/)
ground in Europe, as one third of mid-to-large sized companies in Europe
report significant use of a Free Software database management system. The [leadership
team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00324.html) had its first meeting whilst this issue was being prepared.


**GNOME 2.10 uploaded into Experimental.** Jordi Mallach [reported](http://oskuro.net/blog/freesoftware/gnome-2.10-experimental-2005-04-18-18-37) that most of the pieces of the 2.10 puzzle have been uploaded into the
experimental distribution and many people are already using it. Since newer
versions of a few libraries are needed they were temporarily packaged by the
GNOME team and uploaded to their own repository until newer versions make it
into Debian.


**GFDL and Debian.** Matthew Garrett [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00108.html) in a discussion about the [GNU Free Documentation License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html)
that Debian wants freedom for everybody. Matthew Wilcox [drafted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00127.html) the Debian Free Documentation [Guidelines](https://people.debian.org/~willy/dfdocg-0.4.txt) that
define slightly different goals or freedoms for documentation than for
software.


**User Poll: Remove non-free Documentation?** Brian Nelson [conducted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2005/04/msg01851.html)
a poll on whether to [remove](https://people.debian.org/~srivasta/Position_Statement.xhtml)
all [GNU FDL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html)-licensed
documentation. He has [published](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00238.html)
the [results](https://people.debian.org/~pyro/fdl_poll_results.txt)
and emphasised some textual [answers](https://people.debian.org/~pyro/fdl_poll.mail) that several users
gave. Only a few people have [participated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00272.html) in this survey, though. The majority of them don't want
those documents removed entirely but for many it is ok to move them into
non-free.


**Debian Day Call for Papers.** Alexander Schmehl [called](http://blog.schmehl.info/2005/04/21#CfP-Debian-Day) for talk
submissions for this year's [Debian
day](http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2005/day.html), a one day conference for and by Debian developers and affiliates. It
will take place on Thursday, 23rd of June during the [LinuxTag](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/0622-linuxtag) conference
and exhibition in Karlsruhe, Germany. The audience for the Debian Day is
expected to mostly consist of experienced users and developers. Interested
speakers should drop [him](mailto:alexander@schmehl.info) a
note.


**Debian and mplayer FAQ.** MJ Ray [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/04/msg00454.html)
a draft [FAQ](https://people.debian.org/~mjr/mplayer.html) covering
the situation of [mplayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/) in the Debian
distribution. The document summarises former discussions on the debian-legal
list on this topic. He also explains that a new version has been uploaded and
awaits ftpmaster approval and that all questionable code has been removed.


**Debian AMD64 Meeting.** A Debian AMD64 porters IRC meeting
took place on April, 23th where the main topic of discussion was the
unofficial release of the AMD64 port
for sarge and the move from [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/) to
a new machine with more disk space. Several people have
been assigned tasks for the upcoming release. The new machine will be hosted
at the [University of Darmstadt](http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/). A [summary](http://debian-amd64.alioth.debian.org/irc-summary.txt) and
the [IRC log](http://debian-amd64.alioth.debian.org/irc-log.txt)
are available.


**New Debian Consultants Policy.** The
Debian consultants team has published the new
[policy](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00096.html) for additions to the [consultants web page](https://www.debian.org/consultants/#policy). A working e-mail address is now required by policy
for all listed consultants and those who haven't provided one should contact the
[consultants team](mailto:consultants@debian.org) and update
their record.


**Debian Project Leader Report.** Branden Robinson [sent](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/04/msg00019.html) in his first project leader [report](https://people.debian.org/~branden/dpl/reports/2005-04-24.html) in which he talks about sarge release issues, the ARM buildds,
Debian assets around the world, interviews he gave, and more. Other issues were a
backup site for [snapshots](http://snapshot.debian.net) and a more
comprehensive backup strategy for machines critical to Debian's
infrastructure.


**One Year Debian Employment.** Joey Hess sent in a [summary](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2005/04/msg00131.html)
about the past year in which he was employed by SLX Debian Labs to work on
debian-edu. He compared the items on his todo list with the work actually
done, which boils down to a lot of work towards the release of sarge.
Additionally, he just [moved](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/moving-2005-04-25-01-23.html) his installer test farm into a remote rack.


**Importance of the Snapshot Service.** Adrian van Bidder [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00327.html)
if the [snapshot](http://snapshot.debian.net/) service shouldn't be
promoted to an official debian.org service in recognition of its value to the
project. Martin Schulze [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00333.html)
that it has been very helpful for security work when older package versions
have had to be reviewed.


**AMD64 Port Status.** Andreas Jochens [tried](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg00884.html) to
build the current testing distribution for the AMD64 architecture from scratch
which took only about one week on a standard single processor EM64T-P4 box.
This was very promising since almost all packages build on this architecture
without problems using the pristine Debian sarge sources.
