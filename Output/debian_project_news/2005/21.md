Debian Weekly News - May 25th, 2005
===================================


Welcome to this year's 21st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. A lot of activity has still been recorded on the [debian-release](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/) list in
order to fix the remaining [release-critical](https://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/) bugs and
to get the translations into shape. Matt Whipp [quoted](http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/69766/open-source-not-running-short-of-developers.html) several people to counter the claim that Free Software is running
short of developers.


**Debian Desktop with 12 Watts.** Silas Bennett wanted to run
a low-power desktop system and ended up using a [Mac mini](http://www.apple.com/macmini/). He [described](http://www.home.earthlink.net/~silasb/macbat/) that he had
removed the hard disk and CD-ROM drive to save power and space that he could
reuse with a battery pack, so that the system draws 12 watts from it. He was
also delighted to see the sarge installer run flawlessly.


**Debian GNU/Hurd running GNOME and Qt.** Michael Banck [managed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2005/05/msg00109.html)
to get GNOME compile and run on GNU/Hurd, albeit with some caveats and loose
ends, and also took a [screenshot](https://people.debian.org/~mbanck/media/hurd-gnome.png).
Several packages had to be modified in order to make them build, so
that GNOME won't be uploaded for hurd-i386 soon, but the general issues
seem to have been solved. In related news, Qt is [running](https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2005/04/msg00082.html)
fine on the Hurd as well, and volunteers are sought after for
porting KDE.


**Changes to the weekly WNPP Posting.** Martin Michlmayr [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00012.html) that the weekly mail about work-needing and prospective [packages](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/) won't be sent to the announce list
anymore but to the dedicated [debian-wnpp](https://lists.debian.org/debian-wnpp/) list instead. In addition to that, future mails will only
include new entries in order to have the mails be helpful again.


**Confusing Package Versions.** Nico Golde [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01023.html)
that the most recent version of [unrar](https://packages.debian.org/unrar) has a lower version number than the packages before. Roberto
Sanchez [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01024.html) that the old package was non-free and has been replaced by a
free version with a lower version number. Unfortunately it can't [cope](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01029.html)
with current RAR 3.x archives. The free version has since then been renamed
into [unrar-free](https://packages.debian.org/unrar-free) to avoid
confusion.


**Packaging Waste.** Romain Beauxis wanted to [package](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg00444.html)
[waste](http://waste.sourceforge.net/) a collaboration tool for
small teams. Mirco Bauer [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/05/msg00353.html)
that the authors considered this [unauthorised software](http://www.nullsoft.com/free/waste/). It
seems that Nullsoft's parent company AOL didn't agree to the release, hence
the strong message.


**Last Update to Woody.** Joey Schulze [sent](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00013.html) in the [preparation](https://people.debian.org/~joey/3.0r6/) for the last update to Debian 3.0. As usual, this mostly adds
recent security updates to the woody release. He also [explained](http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200505130653) that
there can't be another update after the release of sarge due to deficiencies
in the archive [suite](http://cvs.debian.org/dak/?cvsroot=dak).


**Non-US being phased out.** Frans Pop [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/05/msg01163.html)
a paragraph about the end of the non-US archive to be added to the [release notes](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/releasenotes) since it is
dysfunctional and not needed anymore. From the 29 [packages](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/05/msg01354.html)
still included, only five haven't been able to be [moved](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/05/msg01355.html)
into the main archive.


**Debian-Volatile Strategy.** The volatile team [pondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00016.html) to create a second [volatile](http://volatile.debian.net/) archive with less strict criteria. This would help packages such
as [Gaim](https://packages.debian.org/gaim) that need to be updated
during the lifetime of sarge in order to support modified protocols. They are
also looking for ways to announce updated packages.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
