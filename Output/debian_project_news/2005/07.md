Debian Weekly News - February 15th, 2005
========================================


Welcome to this year's 7th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Legal professionals in Australia have [developed](http://www.linuxworld.com.au/index.php/id;631120522;fp;2;fpid;1) a new judical information system based on Free Software and
Debian in particular. Chris Halls [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-openoffice/2005/01/msg00257.html) preliminary packages for OpenOffice.org 1.9.73 built with Sun's
JDK.


**Debian Account Managing.** JÃ¶rg Jaspert sent in a [status report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/02/msg00003.html) about the DAM (Debian Account Manager) work. He anticipates
to have cleared the queue by next month already and also explained the general
rules for accepting new developers. Emeritus developers are required to go
through a short new-maintainer process as well, if they want to become active
again.


**Debian-Installer featured in c't.** Andreas Barth [reported](http://blogs.turmzimmer.net/2005/02/05#ct-sarge-di) that
the German c't magazine has [released](http://www.heise.de/ct/05/04/092/) a special CD based on the new [Debian installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/). Joey Hess [added](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/d-i_in_ct-2005-02-05-16-34.html) that the CD uses preseeding to automate the installation. Martin
Zobel-Helas [forwarded](http://www.ftbfs.de/~zobel/cgi-bin/blosxom/2005/02/10#di-iX0503) the conclusion of an article in the iX magazine of the same
publisher that states it is a large step into the right direction.


**Understanding Maintainer Scripts.** Margarita Manterola [documented](http://www.marga.com.ar/blog/index.cgi/debian/Understanding_maintainer_scripts.html) the order in which maintainer scripts are called during package
maintenance and the parameters they receive, since its documentation in the
policy is difficult to follow. She [accompanied](http://women.alioth.debian.org/wiki/index.php/English/MaintainerScripts) the new text with some graphics that several people felt
easier to understand than the plain text from the policy document.


**DebConf5: Call for Papers.** Andreas Schuldei [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/02/msg00002.html) for papers for this year's Debian conference in Helsinki, Finland.
Proposals will be accepted until March 15th 2005 and need to be submitted [online](http://comas.linux-aktivaattori.org/debconf5/). The review
team will decide until April 1st which talks will be accepted. They will be
recorded, and may be broadcast over the Internet.


**Confusing udev Behaviour.** Maykel Moya [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00380.html)
a strange directory `/.dev` and removed its content which left his
system unbootable. Sam Morris [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00384.html) that when [udev](https://packages.debian.org/udev)
starts, the real `/dev` is mounted to `/.dev` so it can
still be accessed. This is only the case if the directory exists, however, so
removing the mount point is fine.


**Configuration under Revision Control.** Enrico Zini [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00495.html)
that he has put his `/etc/` under [svk](https://packages.debian.org/svk) control, which is a distributed
revision control system based on [subversion](https://packages.debian.org/subversion). Florian Weimer
[added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00558.html) that it supports symbolic links natively as well.


**Debian Package Cycle.** Martin F. Krafft [improved](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00537.html) the lifetime [graph](https://people.debian.org/~madduck/graphs/package-cycle/en/) of
a Debian package based on the [work](http://kmark.home.pipeline.com/debian.png) of Kevin Mark. It explains the way a new
package takes into the Debian archive and the way updated packages take as
well as security updates.


**Debian's Wayback Machine.** Martin 'Joey' Schulze [reported](http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200502120543) about the
wayback machine for Debian packages that Fumitoshi Ukai (鵜飼 文敏)
 provides on [snapshot.debian.net](http://snapshot.debian.net/). He explained that
it has become a very helpful resource for his work as member of the security
team since one can easily compare two older revisions of a package with the
`interdiff` utility.


**Mailing Lists Bounce Handling.** Pascal Hakim [discussed](http://www.redellipse.net/stuff/Debian/Lists/bounce-handling.story) handling bounces in mailing list servers. He mentions mail
filters on SMTP-level to prevent spam and viruses which should not result in
an unsubscription. Among other issues, active lists need to be treated
differently than less active lists.


**International Debian Welcome Messages.** Joey Hess [thanked](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/d-i_fun-2005-02-13-18-48.html) Christian Perrier for collecting welcome sound files that could be
played after the installation in many languages. Christian used these files
as part of the Babelbox, a demonstration machine that reinstalls itself
automatically with a different language at each iteration.


**Should Branden run for the DPL?** Branden Robinson is [soliciting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/02/msg00013.html)
input on whether he should nominate himself again for the Debian project
leader (DPL) [elections](https://www.debian.org/vote/2005/vote_001). Before
standing again, he would [like](https://people.debian.org/~branden/dpl/to_run_or_not_to_run_in_2005.html) to hear 100 developers support this action. A wiki [page](https://wiki.debian.org/DraftBranden) has been set up to track
the feedback. 51 people have stated their support so far.

that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
