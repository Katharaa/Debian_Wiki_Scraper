Debian Weekly News - August 30th, 2005
======================================


Welcome to this year's 35th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Carla Schroder [explained](http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netos/article.php/3526396) reasons to use Debian and gave an overview of several
derived distributions. Sean Michael Kerner [reported](http://www.serverwatch.com/news/article.php/3527151) about
Debian's debut in China with Sun Wah's enterprise Debian offering.


**Rejections from NEW.** Jörg Jaspert [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/08/msg00011.html) the requirements for packages to pass the NEW queue. Basically,
all rules should be logical and obvious, but still broken packages get uploaded. The [FAQ](https://ftp-master.debian.org/REJECT-FAQ.html) includes gross
howlers and issues that contribute to a higher probability of a rejection.


**Debian GNU/kFreeBSD Development Machine.** Guillem Jover [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/08/msg00013.html) the availability of a network connected machine running the
Debian GNU/[kFreeBSD](https://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu/) port. All
developers can be granted access to it. He also reported that 81.69 % of
packages in main are available for the kfreebsd-i386 architecture.


**Too many Transitions.** Andreas Barth [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/08/msg00014.html) about the ongoing transition of packages: Glibc, C++
ABI, KDE, X.Org and GNOME. He asked developers not to rename any libraries or
bump the soname before these transitions are finished, since that would have
the potential to stall the process even more. Many packages are blocked from
testing due to these transitions already.


**Ranking Bug Reports.** Paul Brossier [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01034.html)
to add a feature to the [bug tracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/) to
measure the number of users that are annoyed by each bug in order to get an
impression of the importance of the particular bug. Stuart Yeates [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01038.html)
that a good way to start could be a cross-reference to the [popularity contest](https://popcon.debian.org/). Jon Dowland [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01050.html)
that bugs are already rated by severity.


**Posix-compliant Scripts.** Brian Carlson [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01489.html)
that all maintainers test their packages with [posh](https://packages.debian.org/posh) as standard shell. Steve
Langasek [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01517.html)
that the practical impact would be zero since the POSIX extensions mentioned
are supported by the other shells, including [busybox](https://packages.debian.org/busybox). Marco d'Itri [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01541.html)
that `posh` does not even provide a size benefit.


**Debian CD/DVD Contents.** Jerome Warnier [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01497.html)
if there was a way to determine on which official CD a particular package is
distributed. Bartosz Fenski [answered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01522.html)
that currently this is only possible by looking at the [jigdo](https://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/) files. Guilherme de S. Pastore [pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01523.html)
to an automatically generated [list](http://haydn.debian.org/~ftlerror-guest/list.txt) with the
requested information.


**New Upstream Versions.** Nikita Youshchenko [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01582.html)
to allow new upstream versions of Mozilla and friends to enter stable since it
seems to be [impossible](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2005/07/msg00315.html) to properly support them security-wise. Martin Pitt [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01586.html)
that he tried to backport fixes, but ended up with a broken browser, and hence
had to give up.


**New-Maintainer Process.** Yaroslav Halchenko [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00020.html)
if there is a sufficient quantity of application managers to cover all new
applicants. Marc Brockschmidt [negated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00024.html)
that and [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00064.html) that application managers need to invest some time on a regular
basis and know a lot about Debian. Some of them also get bored by the
repetition.


**European Union Public License.** Ales Cepek [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/07/msg00390.html)
about the freeness of the [European
Union Public License](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/07/msg00394.html). Florian Weimer [found](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/07/msg00399.html)
several flaws that would make the license incompatible with the GNU [General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
Nathanael Nerode also [discovered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/07/msg00477.html) several problems in the draft.


**Debconf Dependency.** Joey Hess [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00136.html)
that he will eventually file bug reports on packages that only depend on [debconf](https://packages.debian.org/debconf) and not on debconf-2.0
as well. The latter is needed so debconf can finally be replaced by [cdebconf](https://packages.debian.org/cdebconf). debconf-2.0 was
added to the Debian [policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/) as a
virtual package in 2002 and has been provided by debconf since 2003.


**Reporting List Spam.** Nico Golde [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00223.html) if
it is possible to report spam distributed via the [lists](https://lists.debian.org/) not only via web interface but also
via mail. Javier FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino PeÃ±a also [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00246.html)
what happens after a mail is reported as spam. Frans Pop [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg00250.html)
that currently data is only collected. The intention is to use the data both
to improve filtering and clean the archives. The set of tools for that has yet to
be developed though.


**Converting Source Code.** Svante Signell [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/07/msg00410.html)
how the copyright of a program is transferred when somebody manually converts
or implements it into a different language. Arnoud Engelfriet [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/07/msg00427.html)
that the converter only owns a copyright of the final work if the translation
required creative work. Sean Kellogg, however, [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/07/msg00457.html)
that the converter would only hold a copyright on the expression that is the
translation.


**Ethical Moments in Debian.** Biella Coleman [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/08/msg00206.html)
the successful defence of her dissertation about ethics and politics of the
Free Software movement and the availability of [chapter six](http://healthhacker.org/biella/coleman-chapter-six.pdf)
which covers the Debian project. In this chapter she explained the internal
culture in the Debian project that she has investigated during several
occasions. According to [Wouter
Verhelst](http://www.grep.be/blog/2005/08/24#coleman_chapter_six) she certainly has a far better view on the general picture than
most developers can ever hope to have.


**Non-free Build Scripts.** Michael Ablassmeier [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/07/msg00581.html)
about the [di](https://packages.debian.org/di) package whose
upstream developers have decided to switch to `iffe` as a configure
replacement. However, it is distributed under a allegedly non-free
license. Bas Zoetekouw [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/07/msg00584.html)
that if a package requires non-free software to build, it cannot go into the
main archive, regardless of the fact that the resulting binary does not
depend on non-free packages.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
