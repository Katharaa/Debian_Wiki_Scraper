Debian Weekly News - January 11th, 2005
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 2nd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. [Knowing Knoppix](http://www.pjls16812.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/knowing-knoppix/index.html) is a beginner-friendly book to help new users with the [Knoppix](http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/) live CD. Bruno Torres
conducted an [interview](http://os.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/12/23/2023223)
with the Debian project leader Martin Michlmayr.


**KDE 3.3 accepted into Testing.** Release Manager Steve Langasek [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/01/msg00033.html)
that KDE 3.3 has been accepted into testing. He also expressed many
thanks to the KDE team for their [efforts](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/01/msg00004.html)
in making this happen, and to Anthony Towns for hand-holding `britney`
through the transition. This transition [closed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qt-kde/2005/01/msg00060.html)
many long standing release-critical bugs in sarge, plus [many](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qt-kde/2005/01/msg00074.html)
more.


**More frequently Package Install and Mirror Runs.** Ken Bloom [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00141.html)
whether it would be possible to speed up the release process by having the
daily archive run (package installations and mirror pulse) run more than only
once a day, as suggested by a release [proposal](https://wiki.debian.org/RunDinstallHourly).
Joey Hess [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00177.html)
that James Troup did not
decline that. Release Manager Steve Langasek also [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00178.html)
having a mirror pulse more often a day would also effect the testing
transition.


**Supporting free Java in Debian.** Michael Koch [considered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kde/2005/01/msg00081.html)
the free Java implementations in good shape to run major applications and
asked for more users to work with them and report bugs. He has gotten the
impression that many people prefer to use non-free implementations instead of
reporting back problems with the free packages. For better support people
should give [Kaffe](https://packages.debian.org/kaffe), [SableVM](https://packages.debian.org/sablevm) or [JamVM](https://packages.debian.org/jamvm) or any of the other
free JVM Implementations in Debian a try.


**Dealing with Firmware Blobs.** Matthew Garrett [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/01/msg00140.html)
how the Debian project is going to deal with kernel drivers that require
non-free binary-only components to be loaded into the hardware. His proposals
include to leave non-free firmware blobs in non-free, but don't force drivers
that require these to be moved into contrib. Steve Langasek [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/01/msg00141.html)
that he won't have a problem with a kernel package that provides some drivers
that need to load firmware blobs from disk being in main.


**Package Building without Helper Tools.** Miriam Ruiz [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-women/2005/01/msg00019.html)
her [article](http://women.alioth.debian.org/wiki/index.php/English/BuildingWithoutHelper) on how to build a Debian package without using helper tools. She
explained, that it is not meant as a proof for an easy way to maintain
packages, but as a comprehensive look inside Debian package building.


**Rudeness in Changelog Files.** Joey Hess [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00472.html) rudeness in two current changelog files and wondered if we really need
to be that naughty in our files. Even though Steve Greenland [agrees](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00481.html)
that this is not the proper place, he can also understand the frustration with
people who get on ones nerves.


**APT Repository Documentation.** Roberto Sanchez [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00490.html)
the [APT
howto](http://familiasanchez.net/~sanchezr/?page=debrepository) he wrote, since none of the other documentation was particularly
helpful to him. Ola Lundqvist [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00493.html)
that instead of doing everything by hand one should use the [debarchiver](https://packages.debian.org/debarchiver) package.


**Sarge Security Updates Propagation.** Joey Hess has been giving
[weekly](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/01/msg00051.html)
reports on packages that contain security updates in sid but which have not
yet been propagated into sarge. He has created a comprehensive [status page](http://merkel.debian.org/~joeyh/testing-security.html)
that contains the same information as well as open bugs for known unfixed
security problems.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
