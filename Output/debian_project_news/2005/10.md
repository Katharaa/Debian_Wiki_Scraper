Debian Weekly News - March 8th, 2005
====================================


Welcome to this year's 10th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Several developers use the campaigning period of this
year's project leader election intensely on the [debian-vote](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/) list and ask the
candidates to clarify their position. John Goerzen [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/03/msg00000.html) that [SPI](https://www.spi-inc.org/) can now [accept](https://www.spi-inc.org/news/2005/20050218) donations by check
from Canada.


**Debian Project Leader Election.** [Anthony
Towns](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/02/msg00119.html), [Jonathan
Walther](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/02/msg00121.html), [Branden
Robinson](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/02/msg00123.html) and [Angus
Lees](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/02/msg00114.html) have also nominated themselves for the upcoming [project leader election](https://www.debian.org/vote/2005/vote_001), so that the
developers can choose among six candidates. The campaigning period
will last until March 21st. Helen Faulkner and
Martin F. Krafft will conduct an [IRC
debate](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/03/msg00071.html) on March 19th and [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/02/msg00130.html)
for suggestions for questions to be put to the candidates.


**The Debian Release Family.** Jason Perlow [explained](http://www.linuxmagazine.com/content/view/45/115/) that
Debian is not only one distribution but a family of derived distributions. He
emphasised that one should not have to install Debian on the same system twice
or more often. He continued to introduce several distributions that are
derived from pure Debian.


**Better Asian Support.** Two Asian companies [announced](http://www.valinux.co.jp/en/newsroom/2005/0301/01/) to
jointly develop a universal Debian GNU/Linux infrastructure and actively
promote the adoption of Debian-based systems in both the Japan and China
markets. "In Asia, especially in Japan and China, Open Source is getting huge
publicity and is now well-received," said Tetsuya Ueda, President and CEO of
VA Linux in Tokyo. Osamu Aoki (青木 修)
 [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/03/msg00013.html)
that there are currently not enough Asian developers to develop Asian support
for the various tools and systems.


**Release Team Meeting.** Steve Langasek [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/03/msg00015.html) that developers affiliated with the release process have had a
meeting in Vancouver, thankfully sponsored by NUUGF. They discussed the needs
to get sarge out the door, and began preparations for a timely release of
etch.


**Debian Project Leader Team.** Jeroen van Wolffelaar [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/03/msg00035.html) the project Scud that consists of a number of developers who
intend to support the new project leader after the election. The idea is to
lead the Debian project with better decisions than a single individual could
do. Due to the diversity of the team, but at the same time, the commitment to
cooperate and discuss possible ways of achieving something in a constructive
manner they believe to be able to lead Debian well.


**APT Migration Status Report.** Florian Weimer [sent](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00969.html) in
the first [status
report](http://www.enyo.de/fw/software/apt-secure/) covering the migration of [APT 0.6](https://packages.debian.org/experimental/base/apt) into sarge
which lists showstoppers and tasks. He also asked for volunteers to install
the new version, recompile their favourite frontend and report success and
problems. Recompilation is required due to a change in the exported binary
interface.


**Automatic Changelog Generation with Subversion.** Torsten
Landschoff [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg01181.html)
if there was a tool that could automatically update the `debian/changelog` file when a change is made to the Subversion
repository. Joey Hess [provided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg01258.html)
a script that will use parts of the `changelog` file for the log
message.


**Handling Buildd Problems.** Thomas Bushnell [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg01198.html)
a discussion about build problems with the buildd network with regards to the
new XFree86 package. While on one architecture the problem is just missing
disk space, the problem on other architectures is more difficult. Steve
Langasek [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg01260.html)
the developers to send a mail to the buildd admin and the release team in such
cases.


**Proper Encoding in Manual Pages.** Eric Lavarde [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg01320.html)
that single quotes and hyphens in manual pages don't always look like they
should. In a response, Clint Adams [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg01321.html)
which characters to use for a hyphen and for a minus sign. Additionally,
Adeodato SimÃ³ [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg01322.html) a workaround described in the [groff](https://packages.debian.org/groff) package.
