Debian Weekly News - August 9th, 2005
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 32nd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Andreas Barth [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/07/msg00020.html) that etch has almost 800 release-critical bugs due to small
glitches in connection with the new compiler and asked maintainers to fix
their bugs soon.


**Risk of a Package Upload.** LoÃ¯c Minier [requested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/08/msg00001.html)
a tool that is able to display the risk of an upload at build time. This
would help when transitions are in place or when a lot other packages [wait](http://bjorn.haxx.se/debian/stalls.html) for a fulfilled
dependency in order to enter testing, where a new upload would cause the
quarantine to be reset and may cause more problems than it solves.


**GNUstep, FHS and Debian.** Eric Heintzmann [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/07/msg00128.html)
how to continue maintaining GNUstep in Debian since its directory layout is
not compatible with the [Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/) (FHS) and upstream developers don't want to change the
layout. He had to admit that he's not able to make GNUstep FHS compliant
without breaking it.


**Debian Core Consortium.** Florian Weimer [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/07/msg00202.html)
how the [Debian
Core Consortium](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1836184,00.asp) was related to the Debian project. Ian Murdock [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/07/msg00216.html)
that it won't be called that way and refers to a group of companies and
non-profit organisations that build Debian derivatives. The goal is to build
a common core that is 100 % Debian.


**MySQL Transition Plan.** Christian Hammers [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/07/msg00145.html)
to use version 4.1 as default and drop version 4.0, since version 5.0 has been
uploaded into experimental. This would require 75 packages to be rebuilt as
[libmysqlclient12](https://packages.debian.org/libmysqlclient12)
would disappear from the archive. Andreas Barth [appreciated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/08/msg00000.html)
to reduce the number of MySQL-packages in Debian, but adding more transitions
at the moment would call for trouble.


**GNOME Transition.** Andreas Barth [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/08/msg00003.html)
that a reasonable part of the Debian archive requires GNOME 2.10 in etch
before these packages can enter etch themselves. Maintainers should not
upload new versions of such packages so the quarantine won't be reset.
Nathanael Nerode, however, [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/08/msg00011.html)
that the GNOME won't happen for quite a while since it needs to wait for the
X.Org transition.


**Debian Science Group.** Helen Faulkner [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01555.html)
the creation of the [debian-science](https://lists.debian.org/debian-science/) mailing
list. It is aimed to encourage discussions about how best to [use](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience) Debian as an operating
system for scientific research and how to improve Debian by making it more
useful to scientists and people working in related fields. It should also
provide an address for scientists where they can ask questions about Debian or
software in Debian and get useful answers.


**X Strike Force moving forward.** David Nusinow [reported](http://www.livejournal.com/users/gravityboy/17763.html)
about the release of X.Org 6.9. He has ported all but one patch from the
Debian package for version 6.8 to the new version, which only took about half
a week due to the new quilt-based [patch
system](http://www.livejournal.com/users/gravityboy/17175.html). He's going to begin work on 7.0 as soon as 6.9 hits
experimental.


**Mass Installation in Vienna.** The Vienna city council [reported](http://www.magwien.gv.at/vtx/vtx-rk-xlink?SEITE=020050705010)
about the city of Vienna providing a customised version of Debian with KDE
("Wienux") for the 18,000 desktop computers of the city. It is up to the
individual workers, though, to choose if they prefer a KDE Desktop or
something else. The officials expect only a few hundred GNU/Linux machines in
the first year, but have found out that more than 4 thousand computers could
run the free operating system.


**Debian mourns the loss of Jens Schmalzing.** Jens (also known
as jensen) [died](https://www.debian.org/News/2005/20050809) on July 30th in a
tragic accident at his workplace in Munich, Germany. He was involved in Debian
as a maintainer and supporter of the PowerPC port. As a member of the kernel
team he was instrumental in taking the PowerPC kernel package to version 2.6.
He left behind a wife and three children. The contribution of [Jens](http://www.theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de/~jens/) will be
continued by other developers.


**Improving the BTS Interface.** Margarita Manterola [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/08/msg00005.html) to
have a friendlier interface to the [bug tracking
system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/) (BTS) that allows for bugs to be sorted on the programming language
of the code and the difficulty of solving them. She also [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/08/msg00007.html)
why automatically using the debtags [information](http://debian.vitavonni.de/packagebrowser/) is not
sufficient.
