Debian Weekly News - March 1st, 2005
====================================


Welcome to this year's 9th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Harald Welte [reported](http://gnumonks.org/~laforge/weblog/2005/02/23#20050223-olsson-newrecord) a 2.1Â M pps (packets per second) UDP packet forwarding rate over
four gigabit ethernet ports, which is a new record for Linux. After [OASIS](http://www.oasis-open.org/), of which Debian is a member, has
accepted a patent policy that has bad consequences on implementation of the
standards, John Goerzen [called](http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-general/2005-February/001227.html) for support for an open letter.


**Debian Release Update.** Andreas Barth [sent](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/02/msg00010.html) in a new update for the release progress in which he outlines the
timeline for the third release candidate of the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/). The buildd
infrastructure is also getting some improvements, and will soon be in
shape for the release. A lot of bugs were fixed and several out-dated
libraries will be removed from sarge.


**Debian Cluster Components.** The Rudjer Boskovic Institute
in Croatia has [released](http://dcc.irb.hr/) their Debian Cluster
Components, which is a fairly complete toolbox for building Debian based
high-performance computing clusters. It consists of a set of Debian packages
which simplify the creation and deployment of Debian based clusters.


**Report from LinuxWorld.** Jaldhar Vyas and others ran
a Debian booth at the [LinuxWorld
Expo](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/0215-lwe) in Boston and [reported](http://www.braincells.com/debian/2005/02/24#report)
about the event. They believed that the show was quite a success, as they
handed out a lot of Debian CDs, and collected a number of donations. More
people have now heard of Debian and its derivatives, which were heavily
represented in the .org pavilion. They were disappointed, though, that the
Free Software community had been separated by a wall from the rest of the
expo.


**GNU/Hurd Progress with L4.** After Marcus Brinkmann finished
the process initialisation code in [Hurd/L4](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd-l4), an ambitious
effort to port the Hurd to the high-performance [L4](http://l4ka.org/) microkernel, the first program was [executed](http://portal.wikinerds.org/gnu-hurd-l4-first-program) on
top of it. Porting Hurd to L4 has slowed down the development a lot, but
the execution of the first user program on Hurd/L4 is a very important
first step.


**Common Release Questions.** Drew Daniels has [set up](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/02/msg00113.html)
a wiki [document](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleaseFAQ) that is
intended to cover most questions that users may have with the upcoming Debian
release, especially its availability and temporary problems. It also answers
questions about new or critical uploads and the inclusion of packages in
sarge.


**Close Relationship between Maintainer and Upstream.** Andrew
Pollock [asked](http://blog.andrew.net.au/2005/02/25#upstream)
Debian developers to maintain a close relationship with the upstream authors
of the software they package for Debian. He mentioned some examples where he
was more or less taking over packages and discussed bugs with their respective
upstream developers who hadn't known about the Debian bug tracking system yet.
This should be done when the bug is not a result of the Debian packaging.


**AMD64 Port Status Update.** Goswin von Brederlow [sent](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg01161.html)
a progress report for the [AMD64](https://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/) port of Debian. Both
GNOME and KDE now have their dependencies fulfilled in the sarge tree.
With the recent reports of successful debian-installer tests on AMD64, this port has
finally caught up with the official release.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.


* DSA 688: [squid](https://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-688) --
 Denial of service.
* DSA 689: [mod\_python](https://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-689) --
 Information leak.
* DSA 690: [bsmtpd](https://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-690) --
 Arbitrary command execution.

newsletter. We still need more volunteer writers who watch the Debian
community and report about what is going on. Please see the [contributing page](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/contributing) to find out how
