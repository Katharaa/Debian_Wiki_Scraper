Debian Weekly News - April 12th, 2005
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 15th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. After an unscheduled downtime of one major host in the
Debian network the machine is [available](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/04/msg00008.html) again, but suffered from gross filesystem corruption.


**Debian Project Leader Election Result.** Manoj Srivastava [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/04/msg00028.html)
the [results](http://master.debian.org/~srivasta/leader2005_results.txt) of the recent project leader [election](https://www.debian.org/vote/2005/vote_001). After running as project
leader candidate since 2001 Branden Robinson eventually won the election in
2005. He [thanked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00087.html) those who voted for him and hoped to gain the confidence of those
who didn't. 504 developers have casted a vote, which is 52.227 % of all
possible votes.


**Why supporting PHP3?** Marcelo Magallon [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg00216.html)
why Debian still supports PHP3 in addition to PHP4 in the unstable (and
testing) distribution. Gunnar Wolf [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg00234.html)
that those packages that depend on PHP3 are available for PHP4 as well or depend on either
version. Andres Salomon [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg00244.html)
that the license was changed which caused people to stay with PHP3 instead of
upgrading.


**Creative Commons License Committee.** Evan Prodromou [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/04/msg00031.html)
that he was contacted by Creative Commons to work out the [issues](https://people.debian.org/~evan/ccsummary.html) over their
licenses. The project leader has appointed him as official representative in
this matter. He created a work group of Debian developers who will participate
in the discussions.


**Acenic Firmware Rewrite.** Peter De Schrijver [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg00285.html)
if people would be willing to work on a free firmware for the Tigon II chip.
Looking at the [datasheet](http://alteon.shareable.org/firmware-source/12.4.13/tigonbk.pdf.bz2) it doesn't seem to be a very complicated chip to code for. He
was [thinking](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg00425.html) about somebody reading the existing firmware sources, writing a
specification and a second person or group implementing the new free firmware
based on the specs.


**Automatic Testing of Debian Packages.** Mads LindstrÃ¸m [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg00377.html)
if there are any tests that are or could be applied to Debian packages
automatically. Petter Reinholdtsen [mentioned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg00380.html)
a prototype [script](http://developer.skolelinux.no/~pere/upgrade-testing/) that will perform an automatic upgrade. Ola Lundqvist [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg00440.html)
comments about functional tests and component tests which are both specific to
the particular package.


**Help needed for Openswan 2.3.1.** Rene Mayrhofer [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg00411.html)
for help with packaging [openswan](http://www.openswan.org/)
version 2.3.1 which is supposed to fix several problems in version 2.3.0.
Since sarge is close to a release, packaging a new upstream version may not
the best idea, even if it is supposed to fix a number of bugs. Rene has made
[available](http://www.gibraltar.at/~rene/openswan/) preliminary
packages for larger testing.


**Packages for GNOME 2.10?** Jordi Mallach [explained](http://oskuro.net/blog/freesoftware/debian-gnome-2.10-2005-03-10-14-49) that the GNOME packaging [team](http://pkg-gnome.alioth.debian.org/) is rather trying to
stabilise the current GNOME 2.8.3 release for testing than to package the new
release. If this works well, they will be starting to work on version
2.10.


**SELinux Integration into Etch.** Manoj Srivastava has [started](http://www.golden-gryphon.com/blog/manoj/software/security/manoj.2005.03.07.html) a mini [project](http://www.golden-gryphon.com/software/security/selinux.xhtml)
to bring Debian's SELinux patched packages back in sync with the latest
upstream and the latest SELinux patches, and to make it easier for Debian
developers to access SELinux patches. Its proper integration into the etch
release after sarge is out could be a worthwhile release goal.


**Debian as a Web Serving Platform.** Ladislav Bodnar [discussed](http://lwn.net/Articles/123949/) several operating systems
for web servers and compared the features and security aspects of Debian
GNU/Linux with those of FreeBSD. With Debian's slow release cycle, the only
way to upgrade some packages was to get them from [backports.org](http://www.backports.org/). The ability to upgrade
the operating system painlessly to a newer version is one area where Debian
enjoys a considerable advantage, says the author.


**Running a homeless non-profit Organisation.** John Goerzen
[wrote](http://changelog.complete.org/node/248) about running [Software in the Public Interest, Inc.](https://www.spi-inc.org/) (SPI)
which has no physical home. Holding discussions, even board meetings and
annual meetings online, is a confusing concept to many people, but it makes
perfect sense to the developers. He also asked how SPI could attract more
people into becoming involved.
