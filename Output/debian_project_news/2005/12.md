Debian Weekly News - March 22nd, 2005
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 12th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. The [proposal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/03/msg00012.html) from the meeting of release and ftpmaster teams was discussed
controversial on the [debian-devel](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/) list by many developers with more than 1000 mails. Many
people don't appreciate to drop several architectures since supporting them
was one big benefit of the Debian system.


**Restricting the License to GPLv2.** Daniel Carrera [pondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/03/msg00312.html)
about the restriction of the Linux kernel to version 2 of the GNU [General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
Looking at the large number of contributors, this would make it nearly
impossible to migrate to version 3 when it is available. Matthew Palmer [fears](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/03/msg00314.html)
for a lot of unpleasant forking action when the new license doesn't look like
what developers expect.


**Debian-Installer Release Candidate 3.** Joey Hess [began](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/rc3-2005-02-28-23-05.html)
to [work](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/d-i_rc3_progress-2005-03-11-21-35.html) on the next release candidate of the new [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/). Most tests ran
[fine](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2005/03/msg00538.html).
He reported that they seem to be on schedule for the release on March 23rd,
which will be 3 months since the rc2 release.


**Creative Commons 2.0 Licenses.** Evan Prodromou [worked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/03/msg00406.html)
on the final revision to the draft summary of the Creative Commons 2.0 (CC)
licenses. This document gives a summary of the opinion of debian-legal
members on the six licenses that make up the CC license suite. Allegedly,
there are already over 1 million works released under a CC license.


**PC Resurrection with Debian.** Richard White [reported](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9973) about his
effort of providing computers for the economically disadvantaged. After he
tried several live CDs he decided to use pure Debian Sarge. Afterwards he
upgraded the [Xfcs](https://packages.debian.org/xfce) package and
used the pinning feature of APT to keep sarge for the other packages.


**Debian Use Survey Results.** Enrico Zini [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/03/msg00019.html) the [results](https://people.debian.org/~enrico/survey/survey.php) of a [survey](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/04/msg01508.html)
on the purposes for which Debian is being used. The results include [use
cases](https://people.debian.org/~enrico/survey/survey.php?field=SCEN) and a [list](https://people.debian.org/~enrico/survey/survey.php?field=INT)
of features that users considered helpful. Another [list](https://people.debian.org/~enrico/survey/survey.php?field=DEED)
contains results the users have achieved with their Debian installation.


**300000th Bug Report opened.** A few days ago the 300000th
bug was [opened](https://bugs.debian.org/300000) by Florian
Zumbiehl in the [bug tracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/). This
overwhelming number can be seen as a dedication from our users and developers
to improve their favourite system. Developers interested in improving the
quality of Debian should take a look at the list of [old bugs](http://master.debian.org/~ajt/oldbugs.html).


**Project Leader Election Vote Period.** Manoj Srivastava [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/03/msg00021.html) for votes for this year's Debian project leader [election](https://www.debian.org/vote/2005/vote_001). Votes must be received by 23:59:59
UTC on April 10th, 2005. The vote must be GPG signed (or PGP signed) with
your key that is in the Debian keyring. He also [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/03/msg00022.html) that votes should not be encrypted, since `devotee` does
not yet deal with encrypted ballots and they would just be ignored.


**Autoconf Usage.** Martin Krafft [wanted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/03/msg00425.html)
to hear reasons for calling the `autoconf` utilities at package
built time, even though the general rule is that they should only used by the
maintainer and not at build time. Calling them while building could, e.g., [reduce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/03/msg00433.html)
the source size but [risk](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/03/msg00604.html) to
render the package not buildable anymore when `autoconf` was
changed.


**Automatic OpenLDAP Upgrade.** Torsten Landschoff [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/03/msg01135.html)
for comments on his proposal for an automatic upgrade path from [OpenLDAP 2.0](https://packages.debian.org/libldap2)
to version 2.1. When the Debian package is updated and the data should be
available afterwards, several precautionary steps need to be taken.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
