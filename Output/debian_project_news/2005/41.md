Debian Weekly News - October 11th, 2005
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 41st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. The Georgia Tech Marine Robotics Group has built an
underwater [vehicle](http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/underwater/) with
Debian as the [base](http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/underwater/software.htm) operating system. Matt LaPlante started a [series](http://www.cyberdogtech.com/firewalls/) of articles that
describe the setup and configuration of a firewall based on Debian, including
DHCP, DNS, proxy services and dynamic DNS.


**Debian Security Infrastructure.** The Debian project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2005/20051004) that the security network has
been improved by splitting off the public frontend to a new [host](https://lists.debian.org/debian-news/debian-news-2005/msg00047.html). This was a required step after an [advisory](https://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-816) recently caused the outgoing
bandwidth of the old server to be totally [saturated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/debian-security-announce-2005/msg00206.html). Two more were [added](http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200510050938)
afterward.


**Dealing with Wiki Spam.** Carlos Parra Camargo [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00604.html)
that several pages in the old [Wiki](http://wiki.debian.net/) were
defaced by a user and restored to the last revision. Riku Voipio [pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00607.html)
to the [instructions](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianWiki/DealingWithSpam) on
dealing with spam in the Wiki.


**Security Updates for Mozilla and Friends.** With [DSA 810](https://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-810) the security team announced
that security problems in Mozilla, Firefox, Galeon and Thunderbird have to be
fixed by more or less using the new upstream version but [keeping](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00632.html)
the old version number. Thanks to the work done by Eric Dorland and Alexander
Sack this hasn't
caused the problems yet that were already anticipated.


**Reviving the Debian FAQ.** Javier FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino PeÃ±a [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00667.html)
for help with maintaining the [Debian FAQ](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/).
Together with Santiago Vila he has cleaned up a lot of sections, but more
improvements are required. Osamu Aoki (青木 修)
[added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01122.html)
that the scope of the FAQ should be limited to brief answers and defer to other
documents for the details.


**Cross-Chroot Account Information.** Rob Browning [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00716.html)
how to configure multiple chroot environments so that the account databases
will stay synchronous to the host system. An [LDAP](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00734.html)
backend as well as [schroot](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00763.html)
and [bind mounts](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00737.html) were mentioned. Daniel Jacobowitz [pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00868.html)
to his [shadow etc](http://return.false.org/~drow/fuse/) effort
implemented with help of fuse, the filesystem in userspace.


**Maintaining local Debian Patches.** Sylvain Beucler [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00802.html)
if there was a mechanism to keep local patches applied to Debian packages even
upon an upgrade. Francesco Lovergine [pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00803.html)
him to [apt-src](https://packages.debian.org/apt-src) that is able
to take over part of the job. Paul Hampson [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01072.html)
that using a sane version number will stop [apt-get](https://packages.debian.org/apt) from updating the package
from the Debian source.


**Hotplug Blacklists obsolete.** Marco d'Itri [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00830.html)
that the new hotplug and coldplug subsystem that has been integrated into [udev](https://packages.debian.org/udev) cannot handle the former
blacklisting of modules anymore but only its own. He later [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01311.html)
that he has implemented support for user-supplied files in
`/etc/hotplug/blacklist.d/` in modprobe.


**Big Endian ARM Port.** Lennert Buytenhek [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00860.html)
the [intention](https://lists.debian.org/debian-arm/2005/08/msg00011.html) to work on a big endian ARM port for consumer devices such as
the Linksys NSLU2 or Synology DS101. Wouter Verhelst [offered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg01051.html)
his help with maintaining a build daemon within the secondary buildd [network](http://experimental.buildd.net/).


**Linux Documentation Project License.** Francesco Poli [discussed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/09/msg00503.html)
the freeness of the Linux Documentation Project License version 2. Matthew
Garrett [responded](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/09/msg00504.html) positively and pointed out that only the so called dissident
test is a problem since the person who is making modifications needs to be
identified.


**Debian Linux Kernel Handbook.** Jurij Smakov and others have
published the Debian Linux kernel [handbook](http://kernel-handbook.alioth.debian.org/) which will help
in documenting the internals of the Debian Linux kernel build process. The
document is still work in progress with a lot of sections missing, but it's a
giant step in the right direction.

that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
