Debian Weekly News - May 17th, 2005
===================================


Welcome to this year's 20th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. A [paper](http://opensource.mit.edu/papers/dafermoslinux.pdf) from the
MIT talks about the development process of Free Software, which is the basis
for an [article](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050508021510445) on Groklaw that emphasises on the importance of Free Software due
to its educational potential. Looking at the traffic on the [debian-release](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/) list it
becomes apparent that Debian sarge will be released soon.


**Inconsistent Password Authentication.** Shaul Karl [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg00423.html)
about the difference between a disabled login and a disabled password. Marc
Haber [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg00689.html) how this works with ssh. Russ Allbery added some [notes](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg00693.html)
about the `UsePam` option. Brian May [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg00741.html)
even more oddities.


**Mixing GNU GPL and FDL Content.** Gueven Bay [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/04/msg00519.html)
if he can mix content licensed under the [GNU FDL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) and the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). Anthony DeRobertis
[emphasised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/04/msg00520.html) that both licenses are incompatible. One would have to get
permission from the copyright holders to distribute their work under a
different license.


**Alioth on the Move.** Wichert Akkerman [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00008.html) that [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/), Debian's
GForge incarnation, will move to a new server. Now that the [AMD64](https://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/) archive has been [moved](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00004.html) to its own server, there will be sufficient disk space on the new
Alioth host. After the move, source code and web pages will be on the same
host again and password changes won't need a day to take effect.


**Upgrade Tests.** Steve Langasek [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00010.html) for upgrade testers. It is recommended to read the [release notes](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/releasenotes) before upgrading,
and in particular Chapter 4, "Upgrades from previous releases". Andreas Barth
has prepared an upgrade report [template](https://release.debian.org/upgrade-report.html) to help when
reporting problems with the upgrades. If you do run into problems please fill
it out, and email it to submit@bugs.debian.org.


**Debian is different.** Anthony Awtrey took a [look](http://www.awtrey.com/tony/foss/debianisdifferent.php) at how
the Debian distribution is developed. He noted that the build and
distribution processes of commercial distributions are tightly locked up while
the development in Debian is open and freely accessible. He mentioned that
for some organisations it is vital that the processes is visible, available
and extensible.


**Automatic Package Testing.** Lars Wirzenius [wrote](http://liw.iki.fi/liw/log/2005-05.html#20050507b) down his
thoughts about automatic testing of Debian packages. These include testing of
upstream functionality with unit tests and the like which should be added to
the upstream source. Testing of Debian packaging functionality should be done
in tools like [linda](https://packages.debian.org/linda) and [lintian](https://packages.debian.org/lintian). For installation and
removal tests a new tool would be needed.


**Call for a Free BIOS.** Richard Stallman [called](http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/free-bios.html) for support and
help freeing the computer BIOS. Formerly, it was impossible to replace and
ran from read-only memory, but is stored in non-volatile writable memory these
days. He asked to purchase CPU chips from manufacturers that support a free
BIOS. In light of digital restriction management it becomes even more
important to be able to [trust](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/can-you-trust) the
computer.
