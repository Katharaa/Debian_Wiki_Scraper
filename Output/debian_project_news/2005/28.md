Debian Weekly News - July 12th, 2005
====================================


Welcome to this year's 28th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Bill Allombert [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg02112.html)
for arm porters to support the [ARM port](https://www.debian.org/ports/arm/) of
Debian. As this year's [Debian
conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/0710-debconf) is taking place now, [Debian Planet](https://planet.debian.org/) carries a lot of content from the attending developers.


**LSB Version to support?** Andreas Barth [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/06/msg00309.html)
which version of the Linux Standard Base (LSB) standard the upcoming etch
release should support. Matt Taggart would like to [support](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/06/msg00310.html)
LSB 3.0 which requires a newer glibc and may also need some tweaks to X.Org,
but both are needed anyway. To get the work done, Dave Neil started a [discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lsb/2005/06/msg00020.html)
on who is working on which part.


**GCC 4.0 and C++ ABI Change.** Matthias Klose [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/07/msg00001.html) the start of the GCC and C++ transition. GCC 4.0 is now the
default compiler in unstable, developers are required to upgrade their build
environment accordingly. Developers are advised not to upload any C++ code,
that build-depends on a library written in C++ which is not yet converted to
the new C++ ABI (Application binary interface).


**Debian Consultants List Update.** Thomas Huriaux [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/07/msg00038.html) that several Debian [consultants](https://www.debian.org/consultants/) have not yet answered a "ping" message via mail, even though
they are required to respond within four weeks according to the new Debian
consultants [policy](https://www.debian.org/consultants/#policy). They will be
removed from the list if they don't answer.


**State of Ada in Debian.** Ludovic Brenta [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01586.html)
about his 18 month of maintainership of many Ada and related packages in
Debian and that he's looking for a new sponsor. He has also written a draft
[policy](http://www.ada-france.org/debian/debian-ada-policy.html)
for Ada packages which should ensure that all Ada packages use the same ABI
(binary interface), and work well together, especially libraries.


**Dummy Transition Packages and the Replaces Field.**
Margarita Manterola [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg02045.html) what to do to avoid dummy packages. These help upgrading
packages to a different package. The [alternative](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg02052.html) means [using](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s7.5.2)
`Replaces` and `Conflicts` settings. Simon Richter [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg02085.html)
how this mechanism is supposed to work on a `dist-upgrade`.


**Circular Dependencies.** Bill Allombert [wanted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg02111.html)
to remove circular dependencies as they cause [problems](https://bugs.debian.org/310490) during an upgrade. Robert
Lemmen created a [summary](http://debian.semistable.com/debgraph.out) of current circular dependencies. Colin Watson [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00062.html)
that [dpkg](https://packages.debian.org/dpkg) will break loops and
that pre-depends mitigate the problems.


**Removing old orphaned Packages?** Frank Lichtenheld [prepared](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/06/msg00040.html) a
[list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/06/msg00041.html) of
packages that have been orphaned more than one year ago with nobody taking
over maintainership. Many of these packages aren't used at all. Martin
Michlmayr [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/06/msg00052.html) more orphaned packages to the list. They are all planned to be [removed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2005/06/msg00042.html)
from the distribution soon.


**Removing non-free Documentation.** Frank Lichtenheld [planned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg02150.html)
to organise the removal of [non-free
documentation](http://packages.debian.net/non-free-docs.html) from Debian. There is not yet a timeline for when he will
file bug reports, though. He also proposed to use a special subject line in
which the used license is decoded for easier recognition of such bugs.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
