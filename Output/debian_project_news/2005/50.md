Debian Weekly News - December 13th, 2005
========================================


Welcome to this year's 50th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Wouter Verhelst [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2005/12/msg00000.html)
for talks for the developer's room at the upcoming [FOSDEM](https://www.debian.org/events/2006/0225-fosdem) conference. Nathanael
Nerode [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/12/msg00074.html) that the C++ transitions are processing well and that he doesn't
expect new problems with it.


**Interview with Branden Robinson.** TuxJournal delivered an
[interview](http://www.tuxjournal.net/intervista6.html) with
Branden that talks a bit about his background and the advantages of the Debian
distribution. His primary focus as Debian Project Leader has been to try to
resolve some long-standing infrastructural issues that have been frustrating
our developers and users.


**Joining Skolelinux Forces.** Steffen Joeris [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2005/12/msg00166.html)
using [www.skolelinux.org](http://www.skolelinux.org/) as a
debian-edu community base featuring a [Planet](http://planetplanet.org/) RSS feed aggregator as well
as email addresses and web space for project members. This should not
only strengthen the debian-edu community but also facilitate
coordination and cooperation between the different local teams.


**Debian stabilising the Linux Landscape.** Tom Adelstein [explained](http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/49490/index.html) how
he switched from several other distributions to Debian GNU/Linux and why it
serves him best. The Debian project tends to attract members with a higher level
of technical expertise and a strong commitment to the Free Software
Foundation. According to [Netcraft](http://www.netcraft.com/),
Debian is currently the fastest growing GNU/Linux distribution for web
servers, with more than 1.2 million active sites in December.


**DCC Common Core 3.0 released.** The [DCC Alliance](http://www.dccalliance.org/) announced the [release](http://www.dccalliance.org/pressrelease2.html) of DCC 3.0.
This is an [LSB](http://refspecs.freestandards.org/lsb.shtml) 3.0
compliant base set of packages based on and compatible with Debian [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/). DCC 3.0 contains 237 packages of
which 200 are binary packages taken from Debian sarge and 32 are a backports
from [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/). The remaining 5 packages
provide LSB 3.0 compliance in such a way that the default application
environment is 100 % [compatible](http://www.dccalliance.org/releasenotes.html) with
standard Debian sarge.


**New Features on buildd.net.** Ingo Jürgensmann [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01102.html)
the inclusion of [armeb](http://www.debonaras.org/), [hurd-i386](https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/), [kfreebsd-i386](https://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu/) and [m32r](http://www.linux-m32r.org/) on [buildd.net](http://www.buildd.net/). Other features include
estimations of package building times on various architectures, more statistics,
links to package information and bugs, and an [overview](http://www.buildd.net/cgi/nowbuilding.cgi) about currently
built packages for those [buildd](https://www.debian.org/devel/buildd/) that
support this site.


**Mixing different Upstream Packages.** Jay Berkenbilt [pondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01140.html)
the inclusion of third party programs from different upstream developers in a
Debian package and was soliciting input. Mark Brown [replied](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01143.html)
with details about the procedure with NIS packages. Nathanael Nerode [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01156.html)
that the inclusion depends on the size of the new program and its prospective
use.


**Splitting Packages.** Bill Allombert [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01170.html)
developers who split their packages into a normal and a data package to obey
to a number of rules that will help Debian keep the archive sober. These
include a naming scheme, keeping program data in the normal package, the use
of symbolic links and actually moving the shared data into the data
package.


**Configuration Handling.** Frank Küster [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01239.html)
how to treat the large number of potential configuration files of the TeX
system best in Debian packages. He proposed to use a new directory for
local files that should be preferred. Bill Allombert [replied](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01254.html)
with details on how the [menu](https://packages.debian.org/menu)
package handles its configuration.


**GPLv3 Development Process.** Francesco Poli [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/12/msg00005.html)
that the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) has
recently disclosed details about the drafting [process](http://gplv3.fsf.org/process-definition) that will be
adopted for the upcoming version 3 of the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). The final text is
scheduled to be released between September 2006 and March 2007 with at least
two draft versions to be released in January and June 2006.


**Debian Task Descriptions.** Andreas Schuldei [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/11/msg00132.html)
for volunteers to document descriptions of various [tasks](https://wiki.debian.org/JobDescription) within the Debian
project. The goal of these descriptions is to separate names and persons from
tasks that should lead to more objective discussion in the future.


**GameBoy Emulators.** Robert Millan [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/12/msg00024.html)
whether GameBoy emulators that are released under the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) should be placed in
`main` or `contrib` since they require potentially
non-free games. However, [gngb](https://packages.debian.org/gngb)
is in `main` while [gnuboy](https://packages.debian.org/gnuboy) is in `contrib`. Andrew Suffield [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/12/msg00029.html)
that there is a thriving community of developers of free gameboy [games](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opengbgames).
