Debian Weekly News - December 6th, 2005
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 49th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Roland Stigge [planned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00364.html)
to file bugs against packages that provide no pristine source package, but are
not native Debian packages either. Andreas Barth [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00604.html)
that the LDAP gateway to the [bug tracking system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/)
has been moved to a new host with a configurable address.


**General Resolution: Opening the Archive.** Manoj Srivastava
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/11/msg00070.html) the discussion period for the general resolution about the [Declassification of debian-private list
archives](https://www.debian.org/vote/2005/vote_002). Anthony Towns has proposed this resolution in accordance with
principles of openness and transparency to declassify and publish posts of
historical or ongoing significance made to the private mailing list.


**Final Debian Conference 5 Report.** Fabian Fagerholm [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/12/msg00001.html) the final [report](http://media.debconf.org/dc5/FinalReport.pdf) about this year's [Debian Conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2005/0710-debconf) in Helsinki. The document is intended for those who
attended the conference and the general public. It includes impressions and
facts from the conference. A more detailed financial report will be available
later.


**Temporary Directories per User?** Noah Meyerhans [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00297.html)
about a discussion within the security team to push the use of per-user
temporary directories as default. With proper code this is only a question of
an adjusted PAM configuration. However, some programs hardcode the
`/tmp` directory.


**C++ Transition Status Update.** Nathanael Nerode [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/12/msg00000.html)
about the transition of C++ libraries due to the [use](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00010.html)
of a different memory allocator in the standard C++ library. Two libraries
are still linked to an older library version and can be [ignored](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/12/msg00003.html),
five packages still need to be [transitioned](https://people.debian.org/~djpig/gcc-transition/)
regularly, five other packages haven't been built on all architectures yet and
a large number of libraries still need to be transitioned.


**Device Nodes with udev.** Miles Bader [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00507.html)
that several old-style device nodes were created after booting a Debian kernel
with [udev](https://packages.debian.org/udev) also installed. Marco
d'Itri [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00511.html) that they result from the kernel configuration. However their
creation can easily be prevented with a proper configuration file for
`udev`.


**New Kernel Package.** Manoj Srivastava [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00590.html)
new features in the new [kernel-package](https://packages.debian.org/kernel-package) package which has undergone a major restructuring. Ramdisk
generation has been improved and can now be controlled via a configuration
variable. The kernel image maintainer scripts now use [debconf](https://packages.debian.org/debconf) and the
post-installation script has become less verbose by that.


**Determining the intended Debian Version.** Christopher
Crammond [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00684.html) if there is a way to determine which version of Debian a given
package belongs to. Marc Brockschmidt [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00693.html)
that almost all packages in stable have been uploaded to unstable before, were
migrated to testing and then were released as stable.


**Dropping Kerberos 4 Packages?** Andreas Barth [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00803.html)
that the [krb4](https://packages.debian.org/src:krb4) packages
accumulate several release-critical bugs that are difficult to fix and that
their [upstream](http://www.pdc.kth.se/kth-krb/) doesn't seem to be
active anymore. Russ Allbery [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00808.html)
that MIT Kerberos is also going to drop Kerberos v4 support as of May of
2006.


**Dropping Support for GCC 2.95?** Thiemo Seufer [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00999.html)
how many users GCC 2.95 still has. Since only 9 packages declare build
dependencies on it, he proposed to remove this compiler version from etch
before its release.

that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
