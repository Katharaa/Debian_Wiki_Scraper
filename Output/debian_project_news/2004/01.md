Debian Weekly News - January 6th, 2004
======================================


Welcome to this year's first issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Debian Weekly News enters its fifth year, since on January
4th 1999, Joey Hess released the first issue. Richard Stallman [wrote](http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/01/05/1146229) that
he quit MIT 20 years ago to create a free operating system, a variation of
which is used by thousands of people today. Merry Christmas to those
celebrating the Orthodox Christmas on the 7th of January.


**Coordination in Free Software Projects.** Giampaolo
Garzarelli and Roberto Galoppini wrote a [paper](http://opensource.mit.edu/papers/garzarelligaloppini.pdf)
about the coordination in modular organizations and used the Debian project as
example. The paper asserts that the production process is hierarchical
notwithstanding the modular (nearly decomposable) architecture of software.


**History of the Social Contract.** Raul Miller [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0401/msg00002.html)
that historically the [Debian Free
Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) were about distributing software and not writing
software because, originally, Debian was not supposed to be about writing
software, but about pulling together a coherent distribution based on what's
already out there.


**Using Kernel Header Files.** Ben Armstrong [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg02272.html)
that source code doesn't compile well on non-i386 architectures due to the use
of kernel include files. Ben Collins [advised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg02273.html)
that kernel headers are not meant for userspace programs. John Hasler [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg02282.html)
to include only the required definitions from the kernel header file into the
package.


**Planet Debian.** Scott James Remnant [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0401/msg00001.html) [Planet
Debian](https://people.debian.org/~keybuk/planetdebian/) which is a collection of recent blog entries by Debian developers
and affiliated people. It reads RSS feeds of about 30 people and works similar
to [Planet GNOME](http://planet.gnome.org/).


**Another non-free Proposal.** Anthony DeRobertis [formulated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0401/msg00062.html)
another proposal to remove non-free software from Debian archives with the
sarge release. This time a rationale is prepended and helps understanding the
issue.


**Debian R Policy.** Dirk EddelbÃ¼ttel [released](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg02332.html) a
draft for a suggested policy for R packages within Debian. In the six years
that Debian members have been maintaining R for Debian, the total number of R
related packages has grown to a full thirty. This draft is a timely concern
since R-based archives such as [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/)
and [BioConductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) are experiencing
enormous growth in the number of their packages. More and more of these may
eventually be turned into Debian packages.


**License Adjustment Letter.** Roland Stigge [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0401/msg00016.html)
about the willingness of the current maintainer and the former author of
`latex2html` to alter its license. This is a requirement before
the package can go back into main. However, this may need an agreement from
[Leeds University](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/) which is attached to
the mail.
Roland seeks comments.


**APT-Howto Redesign.** Gustavo Noronha Silva [thought](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0312/msg00024.html) about
rewriting the [APT Howto](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/) for
sarge. The main focus should be what new sarge users want to know, not
necessarily unstable users. He also want to emphasise the use of
`aptitude` instead of plain `apt-get`.


**Debian-Installer Beta 2.** Joey Hess [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0401/msg00269.html)
that debian-installer in the Debian archive has been branched for beta 2 for
the i386 architecture. The
udebs and installation images have been copied to testing and changes
necessary to get ports working for beta 2 can be propagated into testing as
well. At this stage, the MIPS port is tentatively scheduled for January 17th
release, and the IA-64 port for January 12th. The PowerPC port appears close
to done, but no date has been set yet.


**XFS Support in Debian-Installer.** Steve Langasek [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0401/msg00218.html)
that after several iterations, XFS-enabled
debian-installer netinst [images](https://people.debian.org/~vorlon/d-i/xfs/sarge-i386-xfs-netinst.iso) are now available for
download. Testing of this (unsanctioned, unofficial) image is welcome,
including testing by anyone not specifically interested in using XFS. The
default image on the disk (typing `linux` at the boot prompt instead of
`xfs`) should in all ways behave like the regular daily images.


**Debian-based Distributions Compared.** Barry Smith [posted](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=5564) his fifth and
final article reviewing Debian-based commercial distributions in a Small
Office / Home Office (SOHO) environment. The article reviews Xandros 2.0
Deluxe, and compares it to the distributions previously reviewed: [Lindows 4.0](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=5238), [Lindows 4.5](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=5495), [Libranet](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=5274), and [Mepis](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=5348).


**Partial GNOME Freeze.** Jordi Mallach [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome-0401/msg00017.html)
Debian GNOME maintainers to freeze all packages that are associated with
`meta-gnome2` packages. He listed 13 packages that bear one or
more problems. Each of them is a reason to keep `meta-gnome2` out
of the testing distribution, which stops proper GNOME in sarge.



**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.

**Want to continue reading DWN?** Please help us create this
newsletter. We still need more volunteer writers who watch the Debian
community and report about what is going on. Please see the [contributing page](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/contributing) to find out how
to help. We're looking forward to receiving your mail at [dwn@debian.org](mailto:dwn@debian.org).
