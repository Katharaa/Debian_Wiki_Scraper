Debian Weekly News - July 13th, 2004
====================================


Welcome to this year's 27th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Jordi Mallach [reported](http://oskuro.net/blog/freesoftware/cupsys-transition-done-2004-07-12-09-26) that the transition of GNOME 2.6 into testing is nearly sorted
out. Steve McIntyre [explained](http://blog.einval.com/2004/07/09#md5-considered-harmful)
that the CD/DVD creation process in debian-cd is very slow because large
amounts of data are read and written, and because that data is checked with
checksums several times.


**Debian Software used at Google.** Marc Merlin of [Google](http://www.google.com/) fame reported in an [interview](http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1306281842;fp;16;fpid;0) that Debian is the most comprehensive software library available
for GNU/Linux. He uses `apt-get` and an overall
`getupdates` mechanism to keep the huge farm of servers in
sync. The tool itself is distribution- and even Unix-agnostic, though.


**New Debian based Distribution.** [New Mexico Software, Inc.](http://www.nmxs.com/) (NMXS) [announced](http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/040708/flth017_1.html) that it
will release the new Santa Fe desktop environment which is Desktop-oriented
and based on Debian GNU/Linux on August 3rd this year. Dick Govatski, CEO of
NMXS is proud about its ease of use: "Users won't have to be a Linux guru to
easily use the system." They apparently have spent special effort on
the installer and its hardware detection.


**Lacking commercial Support for Debian?** An [article](http://www.itnews.com.au/storycontent.asp?ID=6&Art_ID=20436)
about GNU/Linux
adoption in organisations, shows that Debian may need to advertise its
[commercial support](https://www.debian.org/consultants/) pages more prominently:
"All the contracting
houses said if you want Red Hat, it's not a problem, but Debian was
harder" said Mike Kennedy, CIO for Australia's New South Wales Office
of State Revenue who have switched their GNU/Linux servers from Debian to
Red Hat.


**Debian Control Center IRC Meeting.** David Moreno Garza [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-desktop/2004/07/msg00000.html) an IRC meeting on July 18th at 16:00 GMT, at #debian-desktop
on irc.debian.org. The main [idea](https://lists.debian.org/debian-desktop/2004/05/msg00025.html)
is to bring users the capacity to configure their entire system. With
portability in mind it is planned to provide a graphical interface, a
web-based one and a command-line driven interface.


**Move Exim 4 to BerkelyDB 4.2?** Andreas Metzler [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/07/msg00015.html) if it would be acceptable to switch [Exim 4](https://packages.debian.org/exim4) to a newer version of
BerkelyDB, namely [libdb4.2](https://packages.debian.org/libdb4.2). Since the release of sarge is planned for the near future, such
a change may have the potential to delay the release but shouldn't.


**Watching new Upstream Versions.** Stefano Fabri [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/debian-devel-200404/msg06580.html) [Debian Watch Health
Status](http://dehs.alioth.debian.org/), a service for Debian developers to monitor upstream package
versions. He [complained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg00213.html) that only very few packages contain proper `watch`
files to utilise this. Blars Blarson [assumed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg00268.html)
that many maintainers don't find them useful.


**Bug Squashing Party.** Frank Lichtenheld [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/07/msg00009.html) the next Debian bug squashing party on July 16th to 18th. As
usual it will be coordinated through #debian-bugs on freenode
(i.e. irc.debian.org) where you will find pointers to all the useful
websites, too. The overall goal is to get the [base system](http://bugs.qa.debian.org/cgi-bin/base.cgi) and [standard packages](http://bugs.qa.debian.org/cgi-bin/standard.cgi) in
a releasable state.


**Discouraged Use of -rpath.** Martin F. Krafft [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00734.html)
why the [rpath issue](https://wiki.debian.org/RpathIssue)
is not documented in the [policy
manual](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/). Florian Ernst [contributed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00740.html)
another [thread](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2002/07/msg01729.html) and a [summary](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2002/07/msg02030.html)
by Richard Atterer. Goswin Brederlow [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00755.html)
that anything that uses `-rpath` will break after the release of
sarge if multiarch support is introduced.


**Python Modules and Versions.** Fabio Tranchitella [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00819.html) that a lot of Python modules are not versioned and are available
only for particular versions of Python. Matt Zimmerman [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00902.html) why those modules couldn't be byte-compiled after the
installation for each installed version of Python. Andreas Barth [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00927.html)
that byte-compilation is not even required.
