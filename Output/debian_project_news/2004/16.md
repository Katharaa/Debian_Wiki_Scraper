Debian Weekly News - April 20th, 2004
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 16th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Distributing firmware blobs in the Linux kernel is still
discussed controversially and probably will be for quite a while. Joshua Kwan
reported about [progress](http://triplehelix.org/~joshk/blog/linux/15.html) with the installer on the Sparc architecture.
Manoj Srivastava also has [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0404/msg00061.html) for
votes on the [general resolution](https://www.debian.org/vote/2004/vote_003) to
add editorial changes to the social contract a second time.


**Java Plugins for Mozilla.** Arnaud Vandyck [explained](https://people.debian.org/~avdyk/no_free_java_plugin_for_mozilla.html) that Debian does yet not have a free Java plugin for the [Mozilla](https://packages.debian.org/mozilla) web browser. Michael Koch
is working on a [gcj
web plugin](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/gcjwebplugin) for Mozilla that only works with Mozilla 1.7 and gcj 3.4. It
will be uploaded to sid shortly after [gcj](https://packages.debian.org/gcj) 3.4 and Mozilla 1.7 are
uploaded. Those who don't want to wait for these packages, can try [konqueror](https://packages.debian.org/konqueror), which uses a
different approach.


**Proprietary Firmwares not a Release Issue.** Anthony Towns
[explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0404/msg00060.html) that the firmware issue consists of two different problems,
firmware being non-free and a violation of the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). While the first is
not an issue for sarge the latter is. He also pointed out that the problem
has been [known](http://lwn.net/Articles/3467/) about for nearly two years.
Later he [asserted](http://azure.humbug.org.au/~aj/blog/2004/04/17#2004-04-17-firmware) that both are not considered release issues at the moment.


**GNOME 2.6 for Debian unstable?** Jordi Mallach [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0404/msg00082.html)
if GNOME 2.6 and GTK 2.4 should be uploaded into unstable and migrated into
testing, even though the GNOME team did not plan this. He says that the
packages in experimental have been tested sufficiently, built on not only one
architecture and that the package splits have been performed on packages in unstable as
well. However, the release manager raised some [concerns](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0404/msg00109.html).


**GPL and Scripting Languages.** Wolfgang Borgert [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0404/msg00030.html) if
it is possible to use modules written in scripting languages and released
under the [GNU General Public
License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) in a proprietary application. Federico Di Gregorio [believes](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0404/msg00033.html)
that as long as one doesn't link directly with the GPL library and only use
the Python interface one is safe. Andrew Suffield, however, [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0404/msg00050.html)
that the resulting proprietary work must function without using any GPL
works.


**Debian-Installer and Linux 2.6?** Joey Hess [wrote](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/26-2004-04-14-01-25.html)
that the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) with
Linux 2.6 is so close he can already taste it. In fact, images can be built
already with only one hacked udeb, and it boots up and works fine all the way
to partitioning. The partitioner does not see IDE devices, though, but the
kernel does, so it looks like only a bug in the partitioner.


**Marking native Debian Packages.** Bartosz Fenski [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg01021.html)
that several alleged native Debian packages are native only by accident and
not on intention. Therefore he proposed to use a special file in the
`debian/` directory to prevent these accidents. Henning Makholm [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg01026.html)
`dpkg-source -b` to refuse to build a native source package if the
version number contains a dash instead.


**Debian GNU/Linux Reference Card.** Wolfgang Borgert [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg01219.html) a
Debian reference [card](https://people.debian.org/~debacle/refcard/) he was working on. He asked interested people to check the card and
report problems to him. The card contains information for people, who either
are new to Debian or are new to any Unix-like system.


**Open Software License.** Free Ekanayaka wanted to [know](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0404/msg00076.html)
whether the [Open Software
License](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0404/msg00079.html) is compatible with the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines).
MJ Ray [believes](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0404/msg00077.html) that it isn't because it terminates copyright permission for any
software patent action, including ones unrelated to the covered software.


**Unofficial Debian 3.0 DVD Images.** Richard Atterer [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0404/msg00026.html) an
untested DVD image with Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 that can be [fetched](http://farbror.acc.umu.se/debian-cd-test/) via [jigdo](https://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/). He ran an older script that
even produced an image, but he could not test it. Jan Houstek [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0404/msg00028.html) that
there are unofficial [images](http://www.the-hidden-realm.de/debian/jigdo-area/) by Jan
Kesten.


**Debian-Installer Documentation.** Joey Hess [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0404/msg01900.html)
translators of the new installation manual to make sure that the translation
actually builds and is reasonably complete. Wolfgang Silbermayr [wanted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0404/msg01865.html) to
work on the German translation but couldn't find the manual. Frans Pop [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0404/msg01867.html)
that the coordinator for the manual is Miroslav Kure and that the manual
itself is hosted on [Alioth](https://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/).
