Debian Weekly News - April 27th, 2004
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 17th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. In light of recent events Nathanael Nerode is working hard
on [splitting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg03877.html) binary firmware blobs out of the Linux kernel so they can be
loaded via the `request_firmware` command which would resolve
incompatibilities with the Linux license. Steve Kowalik [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg01688.html) a
new major release of [linda](https://packages.debian.org/linda), a
policy checker, that adds full support for internationalisation.


**Report from the Linux User & Developer Expo.** Vincent
Sanders [reported](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0420-linuxuserexpo-report)
about the Debian project attendance at the [Linux User & Developer
Expo](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0420-linuxuserexpo) in the London Olympia hall. Debian presented a very professional
appearance to the public. Less common Debian CDs could be cut to order as
Steve McIntyre had production facilities at the booth.


**Progeny Debian 2.0.** Ladislav Bodnar [looked](http://lwn.net/Articles/80473/) at the alpha [release](http://platform.progeny.com/archives/000034.html)
of Progeny Debian 2.0 ([ISO Images](http://archive.progeny.com/progeny/linux/iso-i386/20040412/)).
This is the first example of Progeny's [componentised
GNU/Linux](http://platform.progeny.com/componentized/) idea previously
[mentioned](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2004/09/) in DWN. Each component, for example XFree86 or GNOME
2.4, is in its own apt repository. This is intended make it easier to upgrade
individual components.


**Kernel Security Support for Sarge.** Martin Schulze [described](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg01623.html)
the issues raised by the frequent need for kernel security [updates](http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200404211935) in the
stable Debian release. The
sheer number of packages and releases to support places an unbearable
burden on the security team. Thus the number of packages in sarge needs
to be reduced before the release. A particular problem is posed by the
dependence of some architectures on the 2.2 kernel line which the security team will
probably not be able to support for sarge.


**Request for Help by the Installer Team.** Joey Hess [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg01468.html) for
help with the next debian-installer beta release by processing installation
reports. He reported that there are more than 480 uncategorised installation
reports for which nobody had found time yet. We could have lots of serious
problems we don't know about.


**Purge of Firmware to recommence.** Herbert Xu [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg01488.html)
that he will recommence the removal of non-free firmware blobs from the kernel
where no acceptable solution using user-space firmware loaders has been
provided. This is in accordance with the release manager's decision to treat
violations of the [GNU General
Public License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) as serious.


**Collection of DFSG-compliant Licenses.** Joachim Breitner [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0404/msg00142.html)
that he has started to [collect](https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses) licenses that
are compliant with the [Debian
Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) (DFSG). He also lists those that are not compliant,
though. Frank Lichtenheld [confirmed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0404/msg00143.html)
that he is working with Andreas Barth to create such a directory on the Debian
website.


**Survey on Debian Usage.** Enrico Zini [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg01508.html)
an exploratory survey of Debian usage. The goal of this survey is to
understand the purposes for which the Debian operating system is being used
and the ways in which people use Debian to achieve these purposes.


**Squeak License.** Roland Stigge [restarted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0404/msg00160.html)
the discussion about whether the [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org/)
license is DFSG compliant or at least suitable for non-free. Lex Spoon [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0404/msg00242.html)
that Apple has abandoned Squeak and will not be changing the license in the
foreseeable future so the issues will probably remain.


**ReiserFS 4 License.** Sami Liedes [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0404/msg00229.html) if
the license for `reiser4progs` (GPL and clarifications) renders
this package non-free. The license also tries to declare plugins and a
clustering file system built to work on top of this file system as derivative
works, which Sami denies. People seem to agree that the current license
renders reiser4 non-free or even non-distributable at all.


**Editorial Amendments to the Social Contract passed.** Manoj
Srivastava [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0404/msg00073.html) that the [general
resolution](https://www.debian.org/vote/2004/vote_003) covering editorial amendments to the [social contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract) has passed with a 4:1
majority (3:1 required). From 213 valid votes 174 were in favour of these
changes while 39 people voted for further discussion.


**Sarge Release Status.** Anthony Towns [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0404/msg00074.html)
that he cannot justify the policy decisions to exempt documentation,
firmware, or content any longer, as the social contract has been amended to
cover all these areas and not only software. Hence, these blobs need to be
removed from sarge before it can be released. This will make a release
impossible for this year, though.
