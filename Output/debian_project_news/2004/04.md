Debian Weekly News - January 27th, 2004
=======================================


Welcome to this year's fourth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Ognyan Kulev fixed a long-standing drawback and released an
unofficial [patch](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2004-01/msg00095.html) for the Hurd to finally allow ext2 filesystems with more
than 2 GB. Joe Barr was [looking](http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=03/12/02/1252249)
for a large escape key for the brain, a mind-rotting time waster that truly
allows you to escape for a bit. Then he discovered [frozen-bubble](http://www.frozen-bubble.org/), but managed to write
his article as well. The February issue of the Italian [Linux Pro](http://www.linuxpro.it/) magazine contains a snapshot of
Debian sarge (testing) on a DVD or on 4 CDs respectively.
**New deaf portmap Package.** Josselin Mouette [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01512.html)
a new [portmap](https://packages.debian.org/portmap) package that
doesn't listen on the network by default. The package has been modified this
way since it is installed on a wide range of desktop boxes without the need to
listen to the whole network, introducing a potential security weakness for
desktop users.


**FOSDEM: Call for Papers.** Wouter Verhelst [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0401/msg00065.html)
for papers about any subjects to be held in the shared developers' room at the
upcoming [FOSDEM](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0221-fosdem). Given the
general context of the event, which is aimed at developers rather than users,
talks should be of a more or less technical manner, and should have a duration
of about one hour.


**Removing the Exim Dependency.** Marc Haber [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01184.html)
what to do with about 50 packages in the archive that still declare a
dependency to [exim](https://packages.debian.org/exim) instead of [exim4](https://packages.debian.org/exim4). Since Exim 3 is no longer
supported upstream, and Exim 4 is the default MTA for sarge he intended to
file wishlist bugs against these packages. However, Exim 4 is not a drop-in
[replacement](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01190.html) for Exim 3, since it uses a different configuration file
format that cannot be converted in an easy way.


**Removing the "operator" User.** Colin Watson [wanted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01324.html) to
know which home directory should be used for the "operator" user.
Historically, this user existed only to run dumps of the disks and log in
remotely without NIS, NFS and the like. However, since it doesn't have a real
home directory as default, the account didn't [provide](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01626.html)
this functionality anyway. The discussion [persuaded](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01625.html)
Colin to remove this user from fresh installations.


**Amending the Debian Release Process?** Lucas Nussbaum [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01366.html) to
disregard stable releases and only assign working branches, where packages
would go when the maintainer ask for it, like RaphaÃ«l Hertzog described in his
[platform](https://www.debian.org/vote/2002/platforms/raphael#release1). Adrian
Bunk [objected](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01554.html) and explained that many packages have to go into testing at
exactly the same time to avoid uninstallable packages. He also raised the
question of security support for these snapshots.


**Comparing the two General Resolutions.** Anthony DeRobertis
[compared](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0401/msg01609.html)
Raul Miller's [draft](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0401/msg01453.html) and
Andrew Suffield's proposed [general
resolution](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0401/msg01526.html) for amending the [social
contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract). He compares both proposals sentence by sentence. This should
help people to understand the differences in both intentions.


**Public Debian GNU/Hurd Machine.** GÃ¼rkan SengÃ¼n [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd-0401/msg00050.html) a
public machine running Debian GNU/Hurd which he has made [available](http://hurd.she.kicks-ass.org:8084/). Interested
developers should send him a [mail](mailto:gurkan@linuks.mine.nu)
and ask for an account, if they want to explore Debian GNU/Hurd or test or
compile their packages.


**Installing Debian on Thunderbird mini-ITX.** Henry Kingman
[explained](http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT5006522831.html)
how to install Debian GNU/Linux on a Lippert Thunderbird mini-ITX motherboard
based on a Pentium-M processor. It is not specifically an embedded project,
but it does present obstacles similar in nature to those faced by embedded
Linux developers working with boards with relatively new chip sets. The
article included descriptions of starting with the bf24 boot-floppies and
setting up X11 and sound.


**Linux on Mac Primer.** David Mertz [explained](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-pmac.html) that
Linux isn't only for x86 boxes, but runs equally well on PowerPC machines.
He explained the reasons why users would want to run Linux on a Mac and
evaluated Debian, Knoppix, Yellow Dog, and Mandrake on the PowerPC. David
felt he couldn't really recommend Debian, mainly because of difficulties he
experienced trying to get X11 working.


**MD/Software RAID Support in debian-installer.** Paul
Fleischer [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0401/msg02298.html) that he has been working on
getting MD support into [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/). He has prepared a `mdadm-udeb` package and a
`mdcfg` udeb package, which contains the debconf stuff needed for setup, and
the necessary block file for `partconf`. Paul has [made](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0401/msg02337.html)
the [source packages](http://proguy.dk/d-i/) available, although
the process currently fails when trying to configure a kernel for the system,
requiring the user to install `mdadm` on the target partition, and retry the
operation.


**New Popularity Contest.** Bill Allombert
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0401/msg00266.html)
[popcon.debian.org](https://popcon.debian.org/)
that contains package usage statistics. If you want the
survey to include information about the software used on
your own machines, simply install the
[popularity-contest](https://packages.debian.org/popularity-contest)
package. Among other things, the results are used to decide
which packages should go on the installer CD instead of on
supplementary discs.


**Proper Use of @debian.org Addresses.** Michael Banck
released the [results](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0401/msg00051.html)
of his [survey](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0401/msg00011.html) about the proper use of @debian.org addresses. About one hundred
developers responded, which is about one ninth of the registered developers.
Using @debian.org addresses in relation with Free Software or on
personal homepages was clearly considered to be alright, while uses not
connected to Free Software or just as general purpose email address were quite
clearly considered not alright.


**New Standard Text Browser.** James Troup
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01727.html)
that he demoted the text browser
[lynx](http://lynx.isc.org/) from priority standard to optional.
The new standard text browser is now [w3m](http://www.w3m.org/),
which features e.g. support for tables. There were some discussions whether
[links](http://links.sourceforge.net/) should have been promoted
instead, but up to now the decision hasn't been reverted.


**Booting from a USB Stick.** Rene Mayrhofer [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01507.html) a
new version of [mkinitrd-cd](https://packages.debian.org/mkinitrd-cd) which supports booting from USB CD-ROM/DVD drives, USB sticks
and USB harddisks. Hence, it is no longer only an all-in-one package for
creating live, bootable CD-ROMs. He wondered if he should rename the
package.


**KDE 3.1.5 in unstable.** Chris Cheney [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01629.html)
that all components of KDE 3.1 were uploaded into unstable. However, since
the buildd network hasn't updated their `g++` due to its [policy](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01652.html) to
spend as little time as possible, most packages weren't yet built for other
architectures than IA-32.


**Build Daemon Statistics.** Ingo JÃ¼rgensmann [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01689.html)
additional [information](http://www.buildd.net/) about the Debian
build [network](https://buildd.debian.org/). It reads the
wanna-build database and displays it. Additional information was added about
machines for all architectures, including the status, machine types, CPU and
disk specification.


**Documentation of Source Archives.** Henning Makholm [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01796.html)
that Debian doesn't ship sufficient [documentation](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ap-pkg-sourcepkg#s-pkg-sourcearchives) about pristine and other source archives and hence prepared
draft text. He is seeking feedback on the draft and would also like to know
where to add it.
