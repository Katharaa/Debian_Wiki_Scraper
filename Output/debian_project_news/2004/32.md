Debian Weekly News - August 17th, 2004
======================================


Welcome to this year's 32nd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Of interest to large-scale installations: Hewlett-Packard
finally [offers](http://www.hp.com/hps/linux/lx_debian.html) 24x7
support for [Debian
GNU/Linux with HP Extensions](http://www.hp.com/hps/linux/lx_debian_faq.html). In an [article](http://os.newsforge.com/os/04/07/11/1748243.shtml) Chris
DiBona highlighted the services offered by GNU/Linux vendors and pointed out
that their repositories are miles ahead of competing proprietary commercial
offerings.


**Investigating Sarge Security.** Joey Hess [looked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/08/msg00144.html)
through every [security advisory](https://www.debian.org/security/) issued in 2004
and checked to see if the security hole was fixed in sarge as well. Security
holes not fixed yet in sarge include those in [libpng](https://packages.debian.org/libpng), [libpng3](https://packages.debian.org/libpng3), [php4](https://packages.debian.org/php4), [netkit-telnet-ssl](https://packages.debian.org/netkit-telnet-ssl), [pavuk](https://packages.debian.org/pavuk), [www-sql](https://packages.debian.org/www-sql), [lha](https://packages.debian.org/lha), [log2mail](https://packages.debian.org/log2mail), [hsftp](https://packages.debian.org/hsftp), [trr19](https://packages.debian.org/trr19), and [slocate](https://packages.debian.org/slocate). The other 1.5 years
worth of security advisories back to the release of woody would probably take
several more days to check. [Investigation](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/08/msg00168.html)
of security advisories from 2003 revealed that security updates for [tomcat4](https://packages.debian.org/tomcat4) and [gtksee](https://packages.debian.org/gtksee) are missing in sarge.


**Debian-Installer Review.** Bruce Byfield [reviewed](http://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=04/08/09/164207)
the new [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) (d-i).
He says "It introduces Debian's strengths right at the start, and it goes a
long way toward burying Debian's reputation for being difficult to install."
He added, that, by installing only a minimal number of packages, d-i defaults
to a noticeably more secure system compared to most commercial distributions.
Byfield suggests the new installer ease of use will bring many new users to
Debian.


**What comes after Sarge?** Osamu Aoki [wanted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg00737.html)
to release a new [debian-reference](https://packages.debian.org/debian-reference) package that explains the latest release names.
Naturally he was wondering which name testing will become once sarge is
released as Debian 3.1. Colin Watson opened the curtain and [revealed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg00743.html)
that the release after sarge will be called etch. Quickly, a discussion arose
about using a different name and voting upon the name.


**Zero-Day Non-maintainer Uploads.** Steve Langasek [said](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg00768.html)
that this close to the release of sarge, 3 days can definitely make the
difference between a package being ready in time for sarge, and not being
ready in time. Moreover, history shows us that 0-day non-maintainer uploads
(NMUs) have been very effective at bringing the release-critical (RC) bug
count down rapidly. He would therefore like to declare open-season on RC
bugs, including 0-day NMUs if appropriate until the release of sarge.


**Online Changelog Files.** Andrew Pollock was [missing](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2004/06/msg00023.html) a
possibility to reach changelog files without actually installing the
corresponding packages. Therefore he has created [changelogs.debian.net](http://changelogs.debian.net/) which contained
those files. Martin Michlmayr [revealed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2004/06/msg00106.html)
that changelog files already exist on [packages.debian.org](https://packages.debian.org/). Hence, the new site finally redirects HTTP requests
to the files on packages.debian.org.


**Best Practice QA Uploads.** Matthew Palmer [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2004/07/msg00076.html) to
write a QA upload best practices document after working through quality
assurance (QA) procedures with one of his new-maintainer applicants. The [second
version](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2004/07/msg00088.html) caused some [disagreement](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2004/07/msg00089.html)
on the scope of a QA upload, though.


**Synchronising Skolelinux with Sarge.** Petter Reinholdtsen posted a
[list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2004/08/msg00084.html) of
packages that the [Skolelinux](http://www.skolelinux.no/) people
should push into Debian in order to get Debian synchronised with Skolelinux.
He and Joey Hess are [worried](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2004/08/msg00130.html)
that it may already be too late to get new packages into Debian in time for
the release of sarge.


**Which KDE Version in Sarge?** Co-release-manager Steve Langasek [complained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/08/msg00222.html)
about a last minute upload of a number of packages from KDE 3.3 to unstable.
Since he considers it
undesirable to have a mix of different versions and impossible to get
all of KDE 3.3 into sarge on schedule for the release, he concluded that
KDE in sarge will not be updated from unstable and fixes to KDE related
packages should be submitted to testing-proposed-updates. Chris Cheney [objected](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/08/msg00223.html)
to Steve's assessment, while [Ben
Burton](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/08/msg00224.html) and [René
Engelhard](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/08/msg00230.html) concurred. René also [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/08/msg00228.html)
that [kdelibs-data](https://packages.debian.org/kdelibs-data) again
caused file conflicts with [openoffice.org-mimelnk](https://packages.debian.org/openoffice.org-mimelnk).


**Cdrecord on the Way to non-free.** Jose Carlos Garcia Sogo
[noticed](http://www.tribulaciones.org/blog/computers/software/cdrecord-license_13-08-2004) that Jörg Schilling has added a non-modification clause to a
file within the [cdrecord](https://packages.debian.org/cdrecord)
distribution which renders the package non-free since this is in direct [conflict](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/006193.html)
with the [GNU General Public
License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).


**New LaTeX Project Public License, Version 1.3.** Branden
Robinson [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/07/msg00079.html)
that a new version of the [LaTeX
Project Public License](http://www.latex-project.org/lppl/) (LPPL) has been published, taking most of
debian-legal contributor's comments into account, and the LaTeX project also
intends to see OSI Certification. It seems to be compliant with the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines).
Hilmar Preusse [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/07/msg00153.html)
that the teTeX packages in Debian are released under LPPL 1.2.


**Freeness of the Qt Public License.** Martin Krafft [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00016.html)
if the new [Qt Public
License](http://opensource.org/licenses/qtpl.php) (QPL) is considered DFSG-free, since it is [OSI](http://opensource.org/licenses/) approved and because it was
[requested](https://bugs.debian.org/251983) to remove [libcwd](https://packages.debian.org/libcwd) from main. Andrew
Suffield [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00030.html) that choice-of-venue clauses are decidedly non-free.


**Bug Squashing Week.** Frank Lichtenheld [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/08/msg00005.html) that this entire week has been declared the bug squashing week.
He will be around in #debian-bugs on both irc.debian.org and irc.oftc.net over
the whole period of time (except for system recreation intervals) trying to
keep the party going and appeal to all people to participate on it. He will
be also joining the real life bug squashing party at the TU Darmstadt,
Germany.


**New SPI Officers.** John Goerzen [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/08/msg00006.html) that [Software in the Public
Interest, Inc.](https://www.spi-inc.org/) (SPI) has [selected](http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-announce/2004/000089.html) the [officers](https://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/board/)
during its annual meeting. They are: President: John Goerzen, Vice
President: Benjamin Mako Hill, Treasurer: Jimmy Kaplowitz, and Secretary:
David Graham. He also announced the [annual report](https://www.spi-inc.org/~jgoerzen/ar2004/spi2004.html)
for SPI and encouraged Debian developers to get involved with this
organisation.
