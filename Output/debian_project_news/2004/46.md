Debian Weekly News - November 23rd, 2004
========================================


Welcome to this year's 46th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. In an [interview](http://www.brunotorres.net/en/interviews/richard-stallman)
Richard Stallman explained why it is important in terms of freedom and
cooperation to have schools use Free Software.
VA Linux Systems Japan recently announced the release of [VA Balance](http://www.valinux.co.jp/en/products/balance/), a load
balancing system, based on UltraMonkey and Debian GNU/Linux.


**Bug Squashing Parties.** Several bug squashing parties (BSP)
will take place during the last weekend of this month, on November 27th and
28th. Alexander Schmehl [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/11/msg00002.html) the BSP in [Frankfurt](http://wiki.ftbfs.de/tiki-index.php?page=BSP-Coordination)/Main
(Germany). Anand Kumria [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00193.html)
the BSP in Sydney (Australia). David Moreno Garza [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-spanish/2004/11/msg00016.html) the virtual BSP in [Latin America](https://wiki.debian.org/LatinAmericanBSP).
Finally Steve McIntyre [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/11/msg00004.html) the BSP in [Cambridge](http://wiki.earth.li/DebianBugSquashPartyNov2004) (UK).
The overall planning is done through the
[Debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/BSPlanning).
As usual, #debian-bugs on irc.debian.org will be the virtual counterpart to the
real-life parties.


**Mass Filing of Documentation Bugs?** Brian M. Carlson [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00429.html)
to file serious bugs against packages that contain documentation licensed
under the [GNU FDL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) since it
is not free according to the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines). Colin Watson, however, [recommended](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00432.html)
not to file bugs on documentation until after sarge since the project agreed
by [vote](https://www.debian.org/vote/2004/vote_004) that it was not to be
considered release-critical for the sarge release.


**Debian and LCC?** Laszlo Boszormenyi [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00528.html)
if the Debian project would join to the [Linux Core
Consortium](http://www.progeny.com/news/pressreleases/20041117_lcc.html) (LCC, [FAQ](http://www.mandrakesoft.com/lcc/faq)) or
implement it. Implementation would refer to [LSB 2.0](http://www.linuxbase.org/build/lsb20.html) compatibility.
Ian Murdock tried to [explain](http://ianmurdock.com/archives/000235.html) that it may require to provide a different set of core packages
than Debian provides, even for a Debian-based distribution.


**Speeding up the Boot Process.** Jochen Voss was [inspired](http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2004-November/msg00561.html) by Ziga Mahkovec and [inspected](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00547.html)
boot process of some Debian systems. The [result](http://seehuhn.de/comp/bootlog.html) is not as beautiful as
Ziga's, though. Adrian von Bidder [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00552.html)
that he has moved everything needed by interactive users early in the boot
process, while moving things like postfix, Apache, PostgreSQL etc. to the end.
With this, he could already log in while the system was still booting.


**Alioth Update in Progress.** Wichert Akkerman [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/11/msg00009.html) that he has been working on a new machine that is planned to
replace haydn in the future as Alioth host. The new machine and software are
now approaching a more or less stable state where user experience is sought.
Wichert has copied an all Subversion repositories from Alioth so the new [WebSVN](http://costa.wiggy.net/svn/) gateway can be tested.


**First Debian Women IRC Meeting.** Erinn Clark has [invited](https://lists.debian.org/debian-women/2004/10/msg00031.html)
interested people to participate in the first meeting of the [Debian women](http://women.alioth.debian.org/) sub-project. Helen Faulkner took [minutes](http://women.alioth.debian.org/wiki/index.php/English/IRCMeetingMinutes) of the meeting which was attended by people who are
involved with and use Debian in a variety of ways. Attendants discussed
the success of the Debian women sub-project so far, and plans for future
activities that will further the goal of increasing the participation of women
in Debian.


**Debian Installer Release Candidate 2.** Joey Hess [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/11/msg00010.html) the second [Debian-Installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) release candidate
which is also expected to be the final release of the installer for the
upcoming Debian 3.1 (sarge). Only a few changes have been made to the
installer since the pre-rc2 release last month. Support for LVM volumes on
software RAID has been added among many improvements, though.
