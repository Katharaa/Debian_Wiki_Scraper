Debian Weekly News - August 24th, 2004
======================================


Welcome to this year's 33rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. A lot of work has been done to help release sarge soon.
Several recommendations and removals were requested on the [debian-release](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/) list. Claus
Fischer even [requested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/08/msg00355.html) to document important issues in the release notes. Jeroen van
Wolffelaar [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/08/msg00009.html) maintainers to answer some [questions](http://www.wolffelaar.nl/~sarge/) if they maintain one or
more packages with different versions in sarge and sid in order to help the
release management.


**KDE Package Descriptions.** Enrico Zini [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg00878.html)
that the description of many packages containing KDE components start with the
same four line text describing KDE. He believes that it would make more sense
to first describe the package and then describe KDE. This affects 75
packages.


**Reusing a Package Name?** Jesus Gonzalez-Barahona [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg00952.html)
if he could reuse `cil` as package name for the [C Intermediate Language](http://manju.cs.berkeley.edu/cil/) since
Debian already ships [Chess
in Lisp](https://packages.debian.org/stable/doc/cil) in its stable release. Peter Van Eynde [revealed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg01043.html)
that the package was renamed. Thomas Viehmann [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg01049.html)
that most systems upgraded from woody to sarge and only then to etch won't
have a `cil` package anymore due to its renaming.


**Web Application Maintenance.** Kai Hendry [tried](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg01104.html) to
unify maintenance of web application in Debian. He asserted that their
installation is often painful since they need to modify a database and the
webserver. The [mysql-server](https://packages.debian.org/mysql-server) supports a `debian-sys-maint` super user which can
setup users and databases. A proper mechanism for Apache is not yet
implemented, though.


**Viewing the Buildd Queue.** Andrew Pollock [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg01164.html)
if there was an easy way to view the buildd progress other than [buildd.debian.org](https://buildd.debian.org/) and [www.buildd.org](http://www.buildd.org/). Michael Koch [contributed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg01170.html) this [page](https://people.debian.org/~igloo/status.php) by Ian Lynagh.
Goswin von Brederlow [mentioned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg01172.html)
the per-architecture index pages that link to more detailed lists of
packages.


**No free Debian Logo?** Roger Leigh recently [noticed](https://bugs.debian.org/265352) that the [grub](https://packages.debian.org/grub) package has splash image
support but no splash images. Robert Millan later wondered if the "Open Use"
logo is [DFSG](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)-free. David
Schleef [confirmed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/08/msg00368.html) that the Debian Open Use Logo License is generally considered to
be non-DFSG free.


**On closing Bug Reports.** Norbert Tretkowski [asserted](http://www.inittab.de/blog/2004/08/21#20040821_closing-non-fixed-bugreports) that regardless of the severity of a bug report, closing it with
a comment like "who cares?" is not okay. And there is obviously at least one
person who cares about this particular problem: the submitter of that
bug report. He added that if the maintainer doesn't want to fix a bug, it
should be tagged `wontfix`.


**HP taps Debian for Carrier Grade Linux.** LinuxDevices.com
[wrote](http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS2599970603.html) that HP
will supply Motorola with a Carrier Grade Linux version of Debian, as part of
a [long-term deal](http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS6140933192.html).
The article mentions that Motorola required features not available in
currently shipping GNU/Linux distributions. HP thus decided to roll its own
[Carrier Grade
Linux](http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT2311433767.html) based on the Debian operating system.
