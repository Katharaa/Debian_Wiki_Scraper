Debian Weekly News - May 4th, 2004
==================================


Welcome to this year's 18th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. The [debian-devel](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/) list carried many discussions about releasing sarge in light
of recent editorial changes to the [social
contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract), leading to more general resolutions and much cross-talk.


**Several General Resolutions proposed.** Henning Makholm [summarised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0405/msg00062.html)
all recently proposed general resolutions on the [social contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract) and other foundation
documents. In the interest of reducing the risk of somebody voting for
something they did not intend to, simply out of confusion, he proposed that
the actual voting part of the ballot should contain ultra-short summaries of
which option is which, rather than just "Option A: Steve Langasek's proposal"
and so forth.


**Bootstrapping Debian from Knoppix.**
Norbert Tretkowski wrote a [short
howto](http://www.inittab.de/manuals/debootstrap.html) on installing Debian stable using [Knoppix](http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/) and
[debootstrap](https://packages.debian.org/debootstrap). This method
is helpful especially when the boot-floppies from woody
don't work with your hardware, but you still want to install
Debian stable.


**Is there still a Place for Debian Planet?**
The Debian Planet staff
[wondered](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://www.debianplanet.org/node.php?id=1100)
if the [Debian
Planet](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://debianplanet.org/) (DP) news website is still serving a useful
purpose for the community, especially in light of the more
popular and confusingly-similar named [Planet Debian](http://planet.debian.net) weblog
site. Several readers replied that they would miss DP if it
went off air and gave suggestions on possible changes to the
site. DP is always looking for news stories, especially
longer articles, tips and tricks, or Debian specific HOWTOs.


**Preliminary Schedule for Debian Conference 4.** A preliminary [schedule](https://www.debconf.org/debconf4/?q=node/view/35) has been published for the upcoming [Debconf](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0526-debconf), the annual
Debian conference, which will take place in Porto Alegre, Brazil this year.
Andreas Schuldei [said](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0405/msg00000.html)
the program is so good you should attend, if necessary
selling your car to raise the airfare. He also [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0405/msg00001.html)
a limited amount of travel support for developers.


**Debian Installer Beta-4.** Joey Hess [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0404/msg00025.html)
the fourth beta of the
new sarge installer on nine of Debian's eleven architectures.
New features
include the detection of other installed operating systems and
experimental support for the Linux 2.6 kernel on i386.
The new
installer has already been translated into 35 languages.
Joey also wrote a [retrospective](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0405/msg00006.html)
on the difficult installer release process, with suggestions
on how to improve things next time.


**Debian Conference Status Report.** Pablo Lorenzzoni [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0404/msg00021.html) that the registration period for the [Debian conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0526-debconf) in Porto Alegre,
Brazil is almost over. Due to a number of generous sponsors the first 150
attendants will get free accommodation. Additionally, the hotel has special
offers for DebConf attendees who want to stay longer. The call for papers is
over and the most interesting talks will be selected and published soon.


**New `/media` Hierarchy.** Joey Hess [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg07012.html)
that new versions of [base-files](https://packages.debian.org/base-files) have introduced the `/media` directory for new
installations and stopped creating the `/cdrom` and
`/floppy` directories. Since the paths are hard-coded in many
programs Joey ponders whether it would be sane to have `/cdrom` and
`/floppy` be symlinks into `/media` for sarge?


**Naming Scheme for PEAR and PECL Packages.** Andreas Tille is
in [need](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg07277.html)
of some PHP PEAR packages for the [debian-med](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-med/) sub-project. Steve Langasek
[pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg07320.html)
out that the current consensus among the php4 maintainers is that packages for
PEAR modules ought to be called php-\*, and packages for PECL modules (and
extensions shipped with php4) ought to be called php4-\* and php5-\* as
appropriate.


**Request to add Package Tags.** Enrico Zini [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg07496.html)
that many developers still don't know that they can tag their packages using
[debtags](https://packages.debian.org/debtags), nor how this can be
done. He explained how developers can add tags to their packages and asked
them to add them. Tags are grouped by "facet" or "namespace", which
basically is a different point of view from where to look at the package
archive.


**Draft Position Statement on the GFDL.** Manoj Srivastava [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0405/msg00030.html) a
new discussion on a draft position [statement](https://people.debian.org/~srivasta/Position_Statement.xhtml)
on the GNU [Free Documentation
License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html). The Debian project has been [discussing](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0202/msg00071.html)
problems with the FDL since November 2001.


**Power Management in Debian.** Matthias Grimm wanted to [know](https://lists.debian.org/debian-powerpc-0404/msg00455.html) how
to rearrange the scripts for [pbbuttonsd](https://packages.debian.org/pbbuttonsd). To become more flexible and maybe share development and
infrastructure with other power management systems like apmd the script
environment and maybe the interface have to be reformed.
