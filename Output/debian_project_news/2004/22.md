Debian Weekly News - June 1st, 2004
===================================


Welcome to this year's 22nd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. This was a very quiet week, probably since many Debian
developers are attending this year's [Debian conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0526-debconf). Peter Palfrader [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2004/03/msg00032.html) that he is organising a keysigning party at this year's [LinuxTag](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0623-linuxtag). If you want to
participate, please [submit](http://www.palfrader.org/ksp-lt2k4.html) your key no later than June 19th.


**Notes from the Debian Conference.**
Junichi Uekawa has posted notes he has taken during [Debian Conference 4](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0526-debconf),
including terse descriptions of the following sessions:
Joey Hess on [Debian Installer](http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/diary/200405.html.en#2004-May-27-22:08:13),
Scott James Remnant on [GNU build tools](http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/diary/200405.html.en#2004-May-27-23:05:51),
Steve Langasek on [Dependency in Debian](http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/diary/200405.html.en#2004-May-28-02:11:49),
Matt Taggart's [Backporting BOF](http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/diary/200405.html.en#2004-May-28-04:02:16),
Ian Murdock on [Componentised Linux](http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/diary/200405.html.en#2004-May-29-02:40:55),
Kenshi Muto and Christian Perrier on [internationalisation](http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/diary/200405.html.en#2004-May-30-23:01:08) and
Benjamin Mako Hill's [SPI Workshop](http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/diary/200405.html.en#2004-May-31-01:10:25).


**Central Hardware Database.** Zenaan Harkness [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg01587.html) whether it would make sense to set up a centralised
website/database where hardware manufacturers and individuals could submit
hardware information. Clint Adams [pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg01588.html)
to [PCI IDs](http://pciids.sourceforge.net/) effort. [Knoppix](http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/) hardware information
submission page, there is [linuxprinting.org](http://www.linuxprinting.org/) and the [hardware database](http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/hardware.php3)
from Mandrake.


**Rewriting the DFSG.** Henning Makholm has been toying with
the possibility of [rewriting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/05/msg00955.html) the [Debian Free
Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) (DFSG) such that it enumerates which things a free
license can do, rather than just give examples of things it cannot. The
current [draft](http://henning.makholm.net/debian/dfsg-bis.html)
shows that the whole truth cannot be condensed into the ten commandments.


**Report from Linuxwochen, Vienna.** Gerfried Fuchs [reported](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0526-linuxwochen-report) that the [Linuxwochen](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0526-linuxwochen), Vienna has been a
great success. The show was split into two business oriented and two
community oriented talks. He also gave a talk on Debian packaging. On the
third evening they had a panel discussion with politicians about software
patents.


**Debian 3.1 LinuxTag Preview DVD.** JÃ¶rg Jaspert [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2004/05/msg00197.html) the sarge [preview DVD](http://ganneff.de/ltadd/debian.html) Debian people are preparing for [LinuxTag](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0623-linuxtag). It is based on an
image made by Gaudenz Steinlin and contains packages for both the [i386](http://ganneff.de/1.packages.i386) and [powerpc](http://ganneff.de/1.packages.powerpc) architecture. Due to
the not so limited space requirement multiple languages will be supported on
this DVD.
