Debian Weekly News - October 26th, 2004
=======================================


Welcome to this year's 42nd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Roger So [called](http://spacehunt.info/2004/10#20041025-2) for [papers](http://debian.org.cn/events/admc2005/cfp) for the first Asia
Debian [Mini-Conf](http://debian.org.cn/events/admc2005), to be
held in Beijing, China next February/March. Support for the new m32r
processor architecture has been added to Linux 2.6.9 and the [root filesystem](http://www.linux-m32r.org/eng/download.html) is
based on Debian.


**Support for real i386 Machines.** Frank Lichtenheld [aggregated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/10/msg00204.html) the opinion of the release team and reported that they have
decided to keep -i386 kernels which will continue to run on real 80386
machines. The used [patch](https://svn.debian.org/viewcvs/kernel/trunk/kernel/source/kernel-source-2.6.8-2.6.8/debian/patches/x86-i486_emu.dpatch), though, is [said](https://bugs.debian.org/250468) to
contain security problems, which only exist on real 80386 machines.


**Problematic Xchat Shareware Version.** Giacomo Catenazzi
[noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/10/msg00357.html)
that the [xchat](https://packages.debian.org/stable/net/xchat)
website offers a [shareware binary](http://www.xchat.org/windows/)
for a proprietary operating system. A fee must be paid to unlock the shareware
version and the GPL licensed source code does not include this unlocking
code. This [may](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/10/msg00373.html)
or [may
not](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/10/msg00364.html) pose problems for Debian.


**Debian Project at Conferences.** The Debian project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2004/20041015) that it will participate in
several events in several cities in Europe. Debian will be present at the [LinuxWorld Conference & Expo](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/1026-lwe) in
Frankfurt, at the [Linux-Info-Tag](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/1030-lit-dresden) in Dresden and at [Practical Linux](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/1030-plgiessen) in Gie√üen, all
taking place in Germany. Several Debian related talks and workshops will be
held during these events.


**Report from the Italian Mini-Conference.** Marco d'Itri [summarised](http://blog.bofh.it/id_62) the [mini Debian conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/1016-minidebconf) held in
Milano, Italy. They had interesting talks and discussions about the status of
internationalisation in Debian, and user mode Linux. On the second day they
had talks on how to use [tla/arch](http://gnuarch.org/) to
maintain large Free Software projects, debtags, the concept of custom Debian
distributions, and work on a modular postfix policy daemon.


**Overall Configuration Mechanism.** Mark Roach wanted to [know](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg00919.html) the
proper way to configure several packages with sensible defaults for an
authentication server. Enrico Zini [pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg00979.html) that current trends are centred on debconf preseeding and on
installing cfengine scripts. He also discussed diversions to replace
configuration files of other packages.


**Multinationalisation and Input Methods.** Osamu Aoki [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg00951.html)
about his successful effort to integrate multiple UTF-8 locales and input
methods at the same time. With the script he provides, he has access to all
locales on the system. It also features a customisable startup of X with
hooks to run programs from `~/.xsession.d`.


**Common Database Policy.** Sean Finney [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg00962.html)
a first [draft](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/dbapp-policy/) on a policy for database-driven applications in Debian. The best
approach seems to be to provide debconf questions in a single run-time
dependency package via the debconf REGISTER method, although it's probably not
the best solution.


**Including pre-compiled Object Files.** Wesley W. Terpstra [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01023.html)
if it would be acceptable to distribute pre-compiled i386 binaries that run two
time faster compared with executables compiled with GCC. Andreas Barth [stated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01079.html)
that all binary packages uploaded into Debian should be the same as if
autobuilt. Manoj Srivastava [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01070.html)
that users need to be able to debug the package, and can only do so when it is
compiled with the same compiler they have, i.e. GCC.


**Report from Austrian OS 04.** Gerfried Fuchs [wrote](http://alfie.ist.org/blog/2004/10/24#os04-report.en) an [event report](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/1022-os04-report) where he ran a
booth alone on his own while also giving a talk and listening to others. One
talk was about [grml](http://grml.org/), a stripped down variant of
[Knoppix](http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/) for system
administrators with `zsh` as default shell and some geek tools
added. It will also provide good accessibility features.


**Debian Stable updated.** Joey Schulze [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/debian-announce-2004/msg00000.html) that the Debian project has finally [updated](https://www.debian.org/News/2004/20041026) its stable distribution. Since
the last time Debian stable was updated was in November 2003, a lot of
security updates have accumulated. As a result of eleven months of updates,
no less than 212 security updates are included in this [update](https://people.debian.org/~joey/3.0r3/).
