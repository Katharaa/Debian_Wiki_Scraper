Debian Weekly News - July 27th, 2004
====================================


Welcome to this year's 29th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Pablo Lorenzzoni [reported](http://hackers.propus.com.br/~pablo/blog/?id=34) that the
[Brazilian Debian community](http://www.debian-br.org/) has decided
to celebrate a huge nation-wide party on August 21st for Debian's 11th
birthday.


**New License Test.** Branden Robinson and Matthew Palmer [developed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/07/msg00097.html) the Dictator Test, which has the ability to determine if a
license is not compliant with the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines).
A license is not Free if it prohibits actions which, in the absence of
acceptance of the license, would be allowed by copyright or other applicable
laws.


**Update on Java in Main.** Arnaud Vandyck [reported](http://www.livejournal.com/users/avdyk/4713.html) that [kaffe](https://packages.debian.org/kaffe) has entered testing
recently. A lot of the effort of [moving Java into
main](http://java.debian.net/index.php/MovingJavaToMain) was based on building these Java packages with Kaffe. Another good
news is that a lot of these packages can now be build with [SableVM](https://packages.debian.org/sablevm), which is also in
testing.


**Proposed General Resolution: Force AMD64 into Debian.**
Manoj Srivastava [opened](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2004/07/msg00341.html)
the proposal and amendment discussion period for the general resolution
proposed by Josselin Mouette to force the pure AMD64 port into sarge and sid.
However, with Chris Cheney [rescinding](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2004/07/msg00344.html)
his second the [proposal](https://www.debian.org/vote/2004/vote_005)
[lacks](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2004/07/msg00349.html)
enough sponsors. The project leader also [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2004/07/msg00355.html)
that there is no agreement at all among the amd64 porters concerning the
inclusion in sarge.


**Lightweight GNU/Linux Desktop.** Knut Yrvin [cited](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2004/07/msg00170.html) an
[article](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1624113,00.asp) from
eWeek in which Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols reports about lightweight approaches
to the GNU/Linux desktop, i.e. a GNU/Linux thin-client solution with [LTSP](http://ltsp.sourceforge.net/) (Linux Terminal Server Project).
To deploy LTSP properly without expertise in the house one can use Skolelinux,
which was designed for school use with minimal resources in every sense of the
word.


**New debtags Alioth Project created.**
Given the raise of interest grown around debtags, Enrico Zini [spun](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/debtags-devel/2004-July/000000.html) debtags development from Deb-Usability into an Alioth [project](http://debtags.alioth.debian.org/) of its
own. With the spin off, new infrastructure has been added including
a developers [mailing
list](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/debtags-devel) for developers interested in contributing
or integrating [debtags](http://svn.debian.org/viewcvs/debtags) in
their own projects.


**Debian Booth Appearance Charter.** Alexander Schmehl [resumed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2004/06/msg00094.html)
the presence at this year's [LinuxTag](http://www.linuxtag.org/)
which was quite successful. He described several issues that caused problems
or were nasty and therefore should be done better next year. This discussion
is not limited to the presence at LinuxTag, so everybody is invited to [join](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/) it.


**The Release Problem.** Joey Hess [complained](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/the_release_problem-2004-07-22-23-23.html) that the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) team experiences problems that Debian has in overall
release management in Debian, in miniature. He reported about a string freeze
that was turned into a waterfall of new strings instead which also broke all
kinds of stuff. This behaviour is quite natural, though.


**Sarge Release Status.** Steve Langasek [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/07/msg00016.html) the release team has been hard at work on finalising a viable
release schedule. With the release of debian-installer's second test
candidate at the beginning of August, there is a need to provide a fixed
target for them. Hence, starting 31 July, no more non-RC changes are allowed
into testing for base packages or for packages of priority standard and
higher.


**New Crypto Library for Sarge?** Matthias Urlichs [wanted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/07/msg00075.html)
to update [gcrypt](https://packages.debian.org/libgcrypt11) and [gnutls](https://packages.debian.org/gnutls10) to the current version,
especially since the upstream developers have requested this. This would
alter the dependencies for the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/), though. Ray Dassen [reminded](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/07/msg00076.html)
him of the fiasco in connection with the last upgrade, but Andreas Metzler [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/07/msg00077.html)
why this update will be smoother. However, Steve Langasek [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/07/msg00080.html)
that the packages need to be present in unstable and Matthias finally found a
[path](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/07/msg00086.html) to go.


**Draft Summary of Creative Commons 2.0 Licenses.** Evan
Prodromou sent in a [draft
summary](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/07/msg01193.html) of comments about various [creative commons](http://creativecommons.org/) licenses. Comments
and criticism welcome and should be sent to the [debian-legal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/) mailing
list.
