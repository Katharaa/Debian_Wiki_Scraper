Debian Weekly News - June 15th, 2004
====================================


Welcome to this year's 24th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Tom Adelstein [wrote](http://consultingtimes.com/desktoplinux.html) about GNU/Linux
on the desktop and concluded that it can help enterprises, especially
those short of resources like city governments.


**Status of the AMD64 Port.** Chris Cheney [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/06/msg00002.html) that "the" AMD64 port of Debian is ready for inclusion in Debian
unstable. The port is currently at 97Â % compiled packages with most of
the remaining packages failing to build on other architectures as well.


**Updated Debian Flyers.** Michael Banck is [working](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2004/06/msg00032.html) on updating the [general flyer](https://www.debian.org/events/materials/flyers/general/) for Debian.
Even though it was written as a general flyer some bits should be updated to
reflect sarge and other releases better.


**Packaging Firefox 0.9.** Eric Dorland [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00557.html) how to handle the next release candidate of Firefox. Since the
release of sarge will happen soon, he doesn't want it to be left with a
potentially buggy version. Anthony Towns [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00560.html) that he uploads the new version of Firefox to
`experimental` as soon as possible in order to see if it works as
expected. When it doesn't cause problems, it can be moved to unstable without
much hassle.


**License for Documentation?** Matthieu Delahaye [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00053.html) which license an upstream project should use for their
documentation. The author wrote a consistent manual for this [software](ftp://plg.uwaterloo.ca/pub/uSystem/u++-5.0.ps.gz) which is
not (yet) compliant with the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) (DFSG). Walter Landry [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00054.html)
to simply stick to the license of the program and don't use a different
license for the documentation.


**Cyclic Build Dependencies.** Jeroen van Wolffelaar [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00113.html) that [oaklisp](https://packages.debian.org/oaklisp)
contains a binary file which is used for bootstrapping. There are at least
half a dozen such [loops](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00116.html) in
Debian already. Edmund Grimley Evans [assumed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00114.html)
that such cyclic build dependencies are acceptable in Debian.


**Mozilla Public License.** Jim Marhaus [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00177.html) that the new [Mozilla license 1.1](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html) is not compliant with the DFSG. He also phrased a [draft
summary](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00221.html). This mainly affects Mozilla itself, since the other packages
(Firebird, OpenH323, Bugzilla etc.) are not yet relicensed under the new
license.


**Debian Kernel Maintenance.** Christoph Hellwig [compiled](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2004/06/msg00008.html) a short todo list for sarge kernels and [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2004/06/msg00018.html) if more architectures besides i386, powerpc and ia64 are working
on Linux 2.6. Martin Michlmayr [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2004/06/msg00037.html)
a list of housekeeping issues that have to be dealt with. William Lee Irwin
II [contributed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2004/06/msg00104.html) the current blacklist of tainted files that need to be
sanitised and/or removed from the kernel.
