Debian Weekly News - February 24th, 2004
========================================


Welcome to this year's eighth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Finally, we can send mail using [morse code](http://www.npg.si.edu/edu/brush/guide/unit2/morse.html),
since the [International Telecommunications
Union](http://www.itu.int/) assigned a new [code](http://www.cjonline.com/stories/021704/pag_morsecode.shtml)
(. - - . - .) for the "@" sign. Andreas Barth [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00591.html)
that 16 packages were broken by a recently uploaded broken tar version, that
was fixed later.


**Storing RRD Data and Graph Files.** Jean-Michel Kelbert [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00960.html) where
to store [RRD](https://packages.debian.org/rrdtool) files. Since it
is [impossible](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg01015.html) to rebuild RRD files without data loss due to log
rotation, it must not be stored in `/var/cache`, he asserts later.
However, since the graph files are generated from the data files, they have to
go into `/var/cache`.


**Investigation of the new XFree86 License.** Branden Robinson
[inspected](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0402/msg00102.html) the new [license](http://www.xfree86.org/legal/licenses.html) for XFree86 4.4 and higher. He concluded that the de facto impact
of the change to the XFree86 Project, Inc.'s own license is to render the
XFree86 source distribution GPL-incompatible in many aspects. Keith Packard
[asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0402/msg00116.html)
that he has a strong desire to make the released software on freedesktop.org
from that source completely [DFSG](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)-free.


**Expiration of the GIF/LZW Patent.** Roland Stigge [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0402/msg00168.html) if
it is still possible for sarge to be released before 7 July 2004. If not,
Debian could start preparing to move GIF/LZW patent encumbered packages from
non-free and contrib to main since that's the day when the patent US4558302
expires internationally.


**Report from Solutions Linux.** Julien Blache wrote a [report](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0203-solutionslinux-report) about this
years' [Solutions Linux](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0203-solutionslinux)
exhibition and conference in France. Several Debian developers met at the
Debian booth inside the .Org pavilion and were even interviewed by a French web
radio station about Debian in general and the upcoming release of sarge. The number
of interested visitors at the booth was also higher, compared to past
events.


**Release Progress Report.** Colin Watson wrote a new [report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0402/msg00009.html) about progress made with the release of sarge since December 1st.
He said that the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) is improving, that GNOME 2.4 and KDE 3.1.5 have entered
testing and that XFree86 4.3 has been uploaded to unstable recently. An
important task left is to finish debian-installer and port it to the [remaining](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0401/msg00015.html) architectures. There are also still 350 release-critical bugs
on packages in testing. This isn't something we can release with.


**Pure 64-Bit AMD64 Port?** John Goerzen [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64-0402/msg00235.html) to
stay with a pure 64-bit port to the [AMD64](https://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/)
architecture. When a way forward with the multiarch is finally laid out they
can transition to becoming a multiarch platform while still supporting those
that want a pure 64-bit environment. Josh Hansen [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64-0402/msg00263.html) that
both efforts will continue as long as people are willing to devote time to
them.


**Mozilla Firefox Packages.** Eric Dorland [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg01501.html)
that he had uploaded packages for Mozilla Firefox 0.8. Since the package has
gone through a name change (the package was formerly known as phoenix, then as firebird) it will
take about one week until they appear in the archive. For the interested and
impatient he has copied the files to [people.debian.org](https://people.debian.org/~eric/debian/) as
well.


**Man-pages to be moved to non-free?** A recent [change](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0402/msg00190.html) in
the upstream [man-pages](ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/manpages/) project was detected. As of version 1.65 manual pages from the
POSIX standard are [included](http://linuxpr.com/releases/6599.html) in the upstream man-pages distribution. Their copyright,
however, doesn't talk about distribution and modification, but the latter is
explicitly not permitted, according to the upstream maintainer. Since this
would render the entire package non-free, its packaging has changed slightly
so that non-free parts are stripped off in time.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
