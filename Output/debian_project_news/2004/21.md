Debian Weekly News - May 25th, 2004
===================================


Welcome to this year's 21st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. The June [issue](http://www.apcmag.com/apc/v3.nsf/dir/latest) of the Australian
Personal Computer magazine includes a Debian 3.0 DVD and an installation guide.
We've been told that users can install Debian seamlessly through [Overclockix](http://overclockix.octeams.com/), another [Knoppix](http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/) variant, as well.


**Debian from Scratch**. John Goerzen [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg01431.html)
a Debian From Scratch (DFS) rescue or rather installer CD.
The CD supports all major filesystems and has the usual,
plus some unusual, recovery tools. DFS can be used to do a
Gentoo-like installation of i386 woody, i386 sarge, i386
sid, or amd64 sid. John will package the scripts used to
build the CD soon.


**Package Build Errors.** Goswin von Brederlow [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg01241.html)
how severe it is for a package not to build on a given architecture because of
the use of `uname` instead of `dpkg-architecture`. This
will fail on architectures where the Debian architecture string differs from
the Linux architecture string in the kernel, e.g. when
running an i386 system on an amd64 machine. Thiemo Seufer [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg01244.html)
that only a few packages would be affected by this since `mipsel`
also reports `mips` as Linux architecture, so most of these errors
should have been found by now.


**How to declare versioned Dependencies?** Andrew Pollock [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg01250.html)
how to calculate a versioned dependency to a library, because the package
doesn't [seem](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg01270.html) to work with an older version of the library. Matt Zimmerman [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg01337.html)
that the library package needs to be adjusted with regards to
`shlibs` if it has introduced incompatible changes.


**Linux Kernel 2.6.6 for SE/Linux i386.** Luke Kenneth Casson
Leighton [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg01310.html) new Debian kernel image [packages](http://hands.com/~lkcl/selinux/) for Linux 2.6.6 and [SE Linux](http://sf.net/projects/selinux) since he believes that
some adventurous people might want to try SE Linux from the latest CVS, but
wouldn't necessarily want to go to all the trouble of baking their own
kernel. Please follow these [instructions](http://selinux.lemuria.org/) as well.


**Base System Dependencies.** Joey Hess [complained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg01384.html)
about developers who still change dependencies in the base system. Each of
these changes costs the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) team at least two days of development and testing as they
need to get a fixed version of debootstrap into testing. Some time ago the
release management team declared a freeze of the base system, but some
packages are still being altered.


**Debian Kernel Packaging.** William Lee Irwin III [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg01441.html)
how the new kernel maintenance group will be composed. It will be lead by
him and Al Viro. Additionally, Masanori Goto, Christoph Hellwig and
Benjamin Herrenschmidt have offered their help.


**Debian Kernels for non-x86 Architectures.** Troy Benjegerdes
[started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2004/05/msg00037.html) a discussion on how to best support non-i386 architectures with
Debian kernels. Christoph Hellwig [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2004/05/msg00038.html)
that he would like to see architecture-dependent patches included in the main
package. Thiemo Seufer [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2004/05/msg00043.html) that the real question is how to create kernels from it.


**Spam on the Lists.** Pascal Hakim
computed some [statistics](http://www.redellipse.net/stuff/Debian/spam-counts.story)
on how much spam is hitting the Debian mailing lists. Currently
only about 3.5Â % of incoming messages are forwarded on to
list subscribers. Each day about 60 thousand spam messages are deleted
and almost 1 and a half million emails are delivered to list
subscribers.


**Anatomy of the Debian Filesystem.** Ivan Savov [thought](http://www.debianhelp.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=phpBB_14&file=index&action=viewtopic&topic=5045) about documenting the path where particular files reside on a
Debian system since finding stuff turned out to be a major problem for him
after switching from another system. Thereupon readers created the [Debian
Anatomy](http://www.debianhelp.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=phpWiki&file=index&pagename=DebianAnatomy) document in a Wiki so others could contribute.


**Debian Packages a Day redesigned.** Andrew Sweger [reported](http://www.livejournal.com/users/debaday/15674.html) that
he has redesigned [Debian
Package a Day](http://www.livejournal.com/users/debaday/), set up a database to manage the postings, and has started
loading up new packages from readers suggestions into the queue. He will try
to add some commentary on each package in addition to its description to help
answer the why question. Please [give](http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=debaday) him
feedback.


**Improved Kaffe on the Way.** Arnaud Vandyck [reported](http://www.livejournal.com/users/avdyk/3956.html) that
Debian will be the first distribution to package kaffe 1.1.5, which will be
released next week. This version integrates many improvements in
`gnujaxp`, added `gjdoc` as a `javadoc`
alternative and more.


**GNOME 2.6 for Debian unstable.** Sebastien Bacher [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome/2004/05/msg00197.html) that GNOME 2.6 is indeed ready for an upload into Debian
unstable. It has been built on 9 architectures and a tenth is work in
progress. The release manager also [agreed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome/2004/05/msg00204.html) on this. As a first step, the have [uploaded](http://www.advogato.org/person/seb128/diary.html?start=13)
GTK 2.4.


**Debian Conference 2004.** The Debian project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2004/20040524) this year's [Debian Conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0526-debconf) which will take
place from May 26th to June 5th at SESC in Porto Alegre, Brazil. This is a
conference with, by and for Debian developers, interested and sophisticated
users. The [schedule](https://www.debconf.org/debconf4/schedule) is
composed of talks and birds of a feather sessions. This is a chance for
developers to work together in a less formal setting.

that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.

also know about, send it to [Andrew Sweger](http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=debaday).
