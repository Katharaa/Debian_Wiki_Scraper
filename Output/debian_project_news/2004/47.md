Debian Weekly News - November 30th, 2004
========================================


Welcome to this year's 47th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Debian flyers have been [moved](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/11/msg00014.html) to [Alioth](http://debian-flyers.alioth.debian.org/) for
easier maintenance and contribution. Despite the upcoming release of sarge,
another [update](https://people.debian.org/~joey/3.0r4/) to the
current stable release is being [prepared](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/11/msg00219.html).


**Debian News RSS Feed.** Greg Stark
[wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00772.html)
if [Debian Weekly News](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/) is available via
RSS.
Romain Francoise
[pointed out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00777.html)
that [GMANE](http://gmane.org) provides RSS
feeds for many Free Software lists, including Debian News
[RSS](http://rss.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.user.news)
and in
[blog](http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.user.news) format.
There is currently no official RSS feed provided by the Debian project, though
[volunteers](https://www.debian.org/devel/website/)
are welcome to write the necessary code.



**Saving Download Bandwidth.** Goswin von Brederlow [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00790.html)
to provide sorted `Packages` files in order to reduce the amount of
data that needs to be retrieved for each update since the
`Packages` file for sid is already 13 MB (3.5 MB
compressed) large. Adam Heath [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00916.html)
that the package name alone would not be sufficient and Eduard Bloch [mentioned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00812.html)
`apt-dupdate` as another means to speed up the download. Several
developers have contributed ideas and code about this to [Bug#128818](https://bugs.debian.org/128818).


**The Workstation OS: Debian.** Hindistan Kivilcim [explained](http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/11/23/1933211)
the reasons to make Debian GNU/Linux the operating system (OS) on his workstation
which are crystal clear: "Installing new applications and configuring old ones
in Debian GNU/Linux is a breeze. You do not have to worry about dependencies,
library problems, or even former configuration files." He also emphasised
package dependencies versus file dependencies.


**OpenOffice.org 1.9 for Debian.** Chris Halls [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-openoffice/2004/11/msg00216.html) very rough [packages](https://people.debian.org/~halls/openoffice/test/ooo1.9-java/) for OpenOffice.org 1.9.62 as a preview for the upcoming version
2.0. He warns that these packages are not of the same quality or caliber as
Debian users would normally expect to see. They mostly lack proper Debian
integration as well and the packages will be placed in
`/opt/openoffice1.9.62/`.


**Remote Collaboration.** Don Marti [wrote](http://zgp.org/~dmarti/blosxom/business/collaboration.html)
about fostering the conversations that make a group a team. He
mentions that mail can quickly turn into personal accusations and
misunderstandings so that a short phone call may avoid real trouble. He
also emphasised on the value of online meetings (IRC, IM) and cooperative
online resources (bug tracking system, wikis) and mentioned when they should
not be used.


**Installing Linux 2.6 on Debian.** Falko Timme wrote a [tutorial](http://www.falkotimme.com/howtos/debian_kernel2.6_compile/) on running Linux 2.6 together with Debian GNU/Linux 3.0
(woody). In order to have module support some backports need to be
installed. One of the final steps is creating a ramdisk so that the kernel
will boot properly.


**Bug Squashing Parties last Weekend.** During the bug
squashing parties last weekend, several [release-critical bugs](https://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/) have
been closed. Additionally, a solution for the KDE removal [problem](https://bugs.debian.org/183702) has been discussed and
improvements to the testing scripts prepared. There are some pictures from
the party in [Frankfurt,
Germany](http://www.inittab.de/gallery/2004/bsp_0411/). Corrections for the remaining problems are still
appreciated.
