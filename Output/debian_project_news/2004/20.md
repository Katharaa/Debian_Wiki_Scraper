Debian Weekly News - May 18th, 2004
===================================


Welcome to this year's 20th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. In an [interview](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=6989) Miguel de
Icaza [said](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=6989&page=2)
that Debian's community commitment is fantastic, but it is a very hard platform
to support for an independent software vendor. Philip Charles also [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2004/05/msg00034.html)
new K6 mini [iso](http://na.hurd.gnuab.org/pub/debian-cd/K6/) [images](http://eu.hurd.gnuab.org/pub/debian-cd/K6/).


**Two Debian Developers died.** Debian [mourns](https://www.debian.org/News/2004/20040515) the loss of two project members.
Manuel Estrada Sainz (ranty) and AndrÃ©s GarcÃ­a (ErConde) were killed in a
tragic car accident while returning from the [Free Software conference](http://www.lliurex.net/congres/cas/) held
in Valencia, Spain. The Debian Project honors their good work and strong
dedication to Debian and Free Software. The contributions of both Manuel and
AndrÃ©s will not be forgotten, and other developers will continue their
work.


**Status of Java to main Effort.** Arnaud Vandyck [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-java/2004/05/msg00023.html)
on the progress of moving packages that use Java but can be run without
the aid of non-free software from contrib to main. A number of packages
have been moved to main and new releases of [GNU
Classpath](https://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/classpath.html), [SableVM](http://www.sablevm.org/), and [Kaffe](http://www.kaffe.org/) promise further steps ahead. Two
of the major issues currently being looked at are making [gjdoc](https://packages.debian.org/gjdoc) a proper javadoc
replacement and building [ant](https://packages.debian.org/ant) with Free Software only.
People wanting to help can start by inspecting packages labeled as
unknown on the [Java to
main](http://java.debian.net/index.php/MovingJavaToMain) wiki.


**Debian powers Binoculars.** The world's largest selection of
[binoculars](http://www.binoculars.com) is powered by Debian
GNU/Linux as Jon Thralow [reported](http://newsvac.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/05/12/157257). The site uses a technology they call dynamically generated
HTML. The pages are regenerated every five minutes and pushed to the web
server as static pages. This looks similar to the technique used for the
Debian website itself with regeneration just more frequently.


**Status of GNOME 2.6 for unstable.** Sebastien Bacher sent in
another [status
report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/05/msg00064.html) covering GNOME 2.6 in Debian. The reason is to ask the release
team for advice regarding the transition to unstable, given the [progress](http://pkg-gnome.alioth.debian.org/package-status.html) the
packages have made in the last few weeks. The packages have
been [tested](https://wiki.debian.org/GnomeTwoDotSixFAQ)
by many users without any major issues reported. In response Anthony Towns [told](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/05/msg00071.html)
him that many architectures are still missing and that GNOME is ready when
everything has been uploaded to experimental and only the version number needs
to be bumped up for unstable.


**Should Sun use Debian GNU/Linux?** David Edmondson
[argued](http://www.dme.org/log/2004/05/14/linux-debian-bad-news)
that Sun should base their GNU/Linux efforts on Debian. A
key advantage of Debian is the breadth and depth of
applications just an `apt-get` away. Glynn Foster
[agreed](http://www.gnome.org/~gman/blog//15052004)
with him and noted that for the most part Debian 'Just Works'.


**Supporting more Features.** Eric Dorland [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg00811.html)
how Debian should handle requests to activate compile-time controlled
features. He [asked](https://bugs.debian.org/222421) to [enable](https://bugs.debian.org/231472) deactivated features or split
out packages with these features enabled, but the maintainers were concerned
by feature-creep and having to maintain more packages than needed. Matthew
Palmer [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg00813.html) to either create new binary packages, to add the features into
the existing packages or to make it very easy for the user to rebuild the
package to support the optional feature.


**Removing System Accounts.** Stephen Gran [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg01151.html)
how system accounts should be treated upon removal if they were created upon
package installation. Wouter Verhelst [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/05/msg01156.html)
that it may be a good idea to leave the system user since arbitrary files
could still be owned by it.


**Right of Publicity.** Branden Robinson [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/05/msg00540.html)
why he is annoyed by no-advertising clauses in several licenses. In the
United States, there are several legal [remedies](http://www.law.cornell.edu/topics/publicity.html) available
to people whose names or likenesses are misappropriated for advertising or
promotional purposes. In order to prevent similar misuse no special clause is
needed. Branden seeks information on how this is handled in other countries
in order discourage no-advertising clauses more actively.


**IBM Public License.** Frank Lichtenheld [stomped](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/05/msg00597.html)
over the [IBM Public License](http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/license10.html) again and wondered if it is suited for Debian. [MJ Ray](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/05/msg00600.html)
and [Walter Landry](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/05/msg00603.html) raised some concerns. However, this license is already used
for [postfix](https://packages.debian.org/postfix) as Steven Augart
[pointed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/05/msg00617.html).


**Sendmail Open Source License.** Richard Nelson [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/05/msg00598.html)
that a new license for [sendmail](https://packages.debian.org/sendmail) is discussed and the authors are seeking feedback. In particular
they want to know whether the new license is as acceptable as the sendmail 8
license. [Henning
Makholm](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/05/msg00636.html) and [Nathanael
Nerode](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/05/msg00742.html) asserted that a license is non-free if one is forced to go to San
Francisco to defend ones innocence.


**Concerned about new GPL Version.** Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho is
[concerned](http://www.kaijanaho.info/antti-juhani/blog/en/debian/gpl-dfsg.html) about the [Free Software
Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) (FSF) developing the next generation GNU [General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) (GPL).
One of the rumours about potential changes involve a requirement to post
sources of GPL'd software that is used to power a website, which would
probably fail the [Debian Free
Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines). He also wondered whether differences about the GNU
[Free Documentation License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html)
are symptoms of a deeper difference of opinion between Debian and FSF.
