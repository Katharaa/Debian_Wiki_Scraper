Debian Weekly News - March 2nd, 2004
====================================


Welcome to this year's ninth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. On March 13th there's going to be a bug squish [fest](http://linuxpr.com/releases/6695.html) at the Sydney University
by its local [user group](http://debian.slug.org.au/). Isaac Jones
[described](http://blog.syntaxpolice.org/isaac/index.cgi/technology/contributingToFS.html) that reporting and fixing bugs in software one uses frequently
is one of the easiest ways to get involved in Free Software. Bradley Kuhn
reminded us of the [GIF
patent](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif) that IBM holds until 2006, even though the Unisys patent will
expire soon.


**Debian Project Leader Election.** Manoj Srivastava [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0402/msg00185.html)
that the nomination period is at an end. Three candidates have nominated
themselves: [Martin Michlmayr](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0402/msg00026.html), [Gergely Nagy](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0402/msg00183.html)
and [Branden
Robinson](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0402/msg00184.html). The [platforms](https://www.debian.org/vote/2004/) from these
candidates shall be published over the weekend. The three week campaigning
period has begun.


**New kind of GNU/Linux Distribution?** LinuxWorld [reports](http://www.linuxworld.com/story/43857.htm) on Ian Murdock's
[weblog
discussion](http://platform.progeny.com/weblogs/000005.html), where he proposed a new kind of "component-oriented
distribution". He explains that Progeny is building such a distribution from
which users may build platforms from the bottom up, including only the
features and technologies their products require. Progeny's [component-oriented
Linux](http://platform.progeny.com/componentized-linux/) is being built in the open as a community project, with components
currently based on Debian sarge. The LSB 1.3-certified [core
runtime](http://platform.progeny.com/componentized-linux/releases/status-2004-01-22.html) is available now, with more components and a component-aware, [Anaconda](http://platform.progeny.com/anaconda/)-based installation
mechanism to be added in the coming weeks.


**Root on LVM on RAID with Debian.** Charles
Steinkuehler [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0402/msg05104.html)
how, using Massimiliano Ferrero's [Howto](http://www.midhgard.it/docs/index_en.html), he got Debian running with root on LVM on RAID. He got the
`mkinitrd` script working with root on LVM on RAID by using the
hooks provided to support LVM (RAID is already supported). This allows the use
of `apt-get` to install kernel upgrades from the Debian archives.
Charles detailed the settings he used for i386 architecture, which should work for
other architectures using the same initial Debian ramdisk scripts as well.


**New multi-arch Proposal.** Tollef Fog Heen [reported](http://raw.no/personal/blog/tech/Debian/2004-02-25-01-32_multiarch.html) about a new multi-arch [proposal](http://raw.no/debian/amd64-multiarch-2) aiming at
supporting the AMD64 architecture. Of course, it caused a lot of debate on
the #debian-devel channel, but that was just as expected. Comments are of
course welcome.


**Proposed non-free General Resolution.** Manoj Srivastava [sent](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0402/msg00193.html) a
proposed draft of the ballot for vote that covers future handling of the
non-free section. The voting period for this issue is from March 7th to 21st.
Every [registered](https://www.debian.org/devel/join/) Debian developer can rate
two choices and "further discussion". Manoj solicits comments.


**Firefox Trademark Problem.** Eric Dorland [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg01877.html)
about trademark problems with including the official icon and name of Firefox.
AndrÃ© Dahlqvist informed him that this doesn't seem to be [allowed](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=50876)
upstream. Nathanael Nerode [advised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg01882.html) him
to ask the Mozilla Foundation to explicitly permit naming unofficial builds
"Mozilla" and "Firefox" provided they are clearly labelled as unofficial
builds, or alternatively to provide alternative names for unofficial
builds.


**Including Vendor PPD Files.** Roger Leigh has been [contacted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg02023.html)
by Seiko-Epson to include their free laser printer PPD files in Debian.
Bernd Eckenfels would rather like to have them [included](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg02060.html) in
the upstream package as well. Siggy Brentrup [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00002.html)
why this is unlikely to happen and Francesco Lovergine [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00016.html) a
list of packages for vendor-provided PPD files.


**Apache License Problems?** Chris Waters [discussed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0402/msg00249.html)
the new [Apache Source
License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) which the [Free Software
Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) claims to be [incompatible](http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/04/02/18/215242.shtml) with
the GNU [General Public
License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html), contrary to the [Apache Software
Foundation](http://www.apache.org/licenses/GPL-compatibility). Chris is [concerned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0402/msg00267.html)
about people who might waste time starting projects that could turn out to be
undistributable.


**Open Publication License.** Oleksandr Moskalenko [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0402/msg00278.html) if
the [Open Publication License](http://opencontent.org/openpub/)
complies to the [Debian Free
Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines). Henning Makholm and Nathanael Nerode [consider](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0402/msg00283.html)
one clause non-free, like a similar clause in the GNU [Free Documentation
License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).
