Debian Weekly News - March 9th, 2004
====================================


Welcome to this year's tenth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Christoph Berg [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-hams-0402/msg00019.html)
about a Knoppix based [live CD](http://www.afu-knoppix.de/) including
lots of the hamradio software Debian ships. Wichert Akkerman [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0403/msg00002.html) that the [alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/) service
has been moved to a new server. Additionally, Ethan Sommer has set up a [collection](http://ossadvocacy.org/) of Open Source advocacy
papers.


**Questions for the Candidates.** Anthony Towns formulated a
set of [questions](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0403/msg00010.html) for the project leader candidates. In his platform only Gergely
Nagy mentioned changes to the distribution, replace perl scripts in base by [shoop](https://packages.debian.org/shoop) scripts. The questions
include the new-maintainer process, announcements, installer development,
release process/progress and more. Andreas Tille also submitted a set of [questions](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0403/msg00018.html).


**DPL Bits.** Martin Michlmayr sent in another [report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0403/msg00000.html) and said that over the last two weeks he attended three
conferences: [Open Source World
Conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0218-oswc) in Spain, [FOSDEM](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0221-fosdem)
in Belgium, and a conference in Italy organized by Firenze Tecnologia. He
added reports for these conferences as well. Also, a London based company is
interested in having a 64 bit port of Debian to PowerPC and are willing to
invest resources in this.


**11 Keystrokes away from Debian.** Joey Hess [counted](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/11_keystrokes_to_debian-2004-03-04-01-58.html) the keystrokes in a Debian installation with DHCP and partman's
spiffy streamlined autopartitioning. 11 keystrokes from the boot prompt to the
"Welcome to Debian" screen. 10 of them even were "Enter". The one extra was
selecting the "Yes, please nuke my drive" button. He believes that perhaps
two more keystrokes could be removed.


**Video Cluster running Debian.** The [Visualization Group](http://viz.aset.psu.edu/) at Penn State
University has been [building](http://viz.aset.psu.edu/ga5in/ImmersiveEnvironmentsLab.html) a graphics cluster and tiled video display wall using it for
Architecture and Engineering applications. They utilise [Distributed Multiheaded X](http://dmx.sourceforge.net/) and [Chromium](http://chromium.sourceforge.net/) for an
interactive, parallelized application environment. Applications are
developed with [VTK](http://www.vtk.org/) and
[OpenSG](http://www.opensg.org/). [VideoLAN](http://www.videolan.org/) is also used to stream
a video source to multiple displays via multicast for tiled video.


**Does Debian scare away Women?** Amaya Rodrigo Sastre [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0403/msg00040.html) the
project leader candidates about their ideas to encourage more women to be
involved and what the benefits would be. Helen Faulkner [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0403/msg00067.html)
that women face subtle problems and that on average, women are likely to be
not so confident that their skills will allow them to survive in an
environment like debian, compared to their male counterparts. The following
discussion seems to have very well [proven](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0403/msg00132.html)
this.


**Call for Votes on a General Resolution.** Manoj Srivastava
[called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0403/msg00377.html)
for votes on a [General Resolution](https://www.debian.org/vote/2004/vote_002) to
decide on future handling of the non-free section. Votes must be received by
Sunday, March 21st. The vote is being conducted in accordance with the policy
delineated in section Standard Resolution Procedure of the [Debian Constitution](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution).
**Supporting Hurd with ext2.** Roland McGrath has [written](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2004-02/msg00108.html)
a patch for Linux 2.6 which makes it possible to get and set [passive
translators](https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-doc-translator#actpas) for Hurd via extended attributes for the ext2 filesystem on
Linux 2.6. This makes it possible to archive passive
translators using [star](https://packages.debian.org/star).
Using experimental [kernel packages](https://people.debian.org/~mbanck/xattr-hurd/), Michael Banck
was able to extract a Debian GNU/Hurd base tarball and [successfully
boot](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2004-03/msg00029.html) into a working Debian GNU/Hurd installation without having to
setup translators natively. This could considerable ease the
installation of Debian GNU/Hurd if this patch gets accepted upstream.


**Debian Conference: Call for Papers.** Andreas Schuldei sent
out the [call
for papers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0403/msg00004.html) for this years' [Debian Conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0526-debconf) which will take place from May 26th to June 2nd in Porto
Alegre, Brazil. On day one there will be an introductory talk for all
speakers covering public speaking. The deadline for submissions is April 1st
and interested people should only submit a short description of the
presentation and provide technical details.


**Debian Source Archive.** Joachim Breitner [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00008.html)
whether it is possible and useful, to have a website with all source packages
from the Debian archive extracted and available, including older versions.
Shaun ONeil [mentioned](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00023.html)
the peek of mirror.ac.uk to look into archives and Roland Bauerschmidt [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00034.html)
to use Subversion and ViewCVS.


**Transition Plan for non-free.** Michael Banck [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0403/msg00202.html)
a transition plan to move the non-free archive off of debian.org and on
nonfree.org. In particular he talks about replicating the FTP archive, the [bug tracking system](https://bugs.debian.org/), the [package tracking system](https://packages.qa.debian.org/) and some
mailing lists. He also called for help since the services would have to be
set up at the beginning. At the end, only a few people would be required to
maintain the service.
