Debian Weekly News - June 8th, 2004
===================================


Welcome to this year's 23rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.


**Debian Library Packaging Guide.** Junichi Uekawa [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00069.html) an updated Debian library packaging [guide](http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/column/libpkg-guide/libpkg-guide.html). He has added an [example](http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/column/libpkg-guide/libpkg-guide.html#SHAREDVERSIONLIBHOWTO) on making versioned symbols for shared libraries. This update is
done in response to Steve Langasek's presentation at [Debian Conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0526-debconf). Stephen Frost
[provided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00077.html) additional information.


**Canonical List of Contributors.** Scott Dier [pondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00095.html) how Debian should acknowledge its contributors since this was
discussed during [Debian
Conference](https://www.debian.org/events/2004/0526-debconf). He suggested to compile a list of contributors, consisting of
Debian developers, people who provided patches, ideas and translated strings,
people and organisation that sponsored conferences or hardware. Rob Taylor [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00104.html)
to have a policy on mentioning people in changelog files who contributed
patches.


**Managing Packages with GNU Arch.** JÃ©rÃ´me Marant is [interested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00146.html) in managing his packages with GNU [arch](https://packages.debian.org/tla) and how to maintain the
package repository. At least two approaches and maintenance utilities exist
to accomplish these.


**Naming the AMD64 Architecture in Debian.** The architecture
formerly known as `amd64` has officially been named `x86-64` by [dpkg](https://packages.debian.org/dpkg)
developers. Scott James Remnant [pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00177.html)
out that other vendors don't name it `amd64` and that this is not
the official GNU name for the architecture either. This causes problems for
both preliminary Debian ports, though. Steven Frost [pointed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00184.html)
out that the decision about the arch-names is
not of the authority of the dpkg team and that the patch was [backed
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00212.html) for now.


**Debianplaza Portal growing.** Some Debian users across Europe
started a Debian portal for Debian users who use our favorite
distribution as a hobby. [Debianplaza](https://forums.debian.net/) is a friendly
community site which aims at starters as well as home users who like to
know a little more about Debian. The increasing member list indicates
there's still a need for information in plain English. The site provides
a forum, news and information.


**Free Java on more Platforms.** A user [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-java/2004/06/msg00004.html)
why the current [SableVM](http://www.sablevm.org) (1.1.5) packages
are uninstallable in unstable. SableVM maintainer Grzegorz Prokopski
explained that the debs of class libraries for this version got stuck
for a few days in the NEW queue and pointed to a temporary unofficial [repository](http://gadek.debian.net/debs/). He also
mentioned that this version is able to run Ant 1.6.


**Debian Firebird Maintainers Group.** Grzegorz Prokopski [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00258.html) an [effort](http://firebird.debian.net/) to build a
maintainer group for [Firebird](https://packages.debian.org/src:firebird) packages for Debian. He asserted that he cannot maintain the
packages anymore but can help others to maintain them.


**Packaging Binary and Library.** Tommaso Moroni [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00273.html) how to best package [dact](http://www.rkeene.org/files/oss/dact/release/) since it
provides an executable program and a library. Andrew Suffield [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00299.html) that anything that goes in /usr/lib directly must be in a package
on its own since soname changes would [cause](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00352.html)
breakages otherwise.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.

important updates.


* [epiphany-extensions](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/gnome/epiphany-extensions)
 -- Extensions for Epiphany web browser.


**Orphaned Packages.** 4 packages were orphaned this week and
require a new maintainer. This makes a total of 166 orphaned packages. Many
thanks to the previous maintainers who contributed to the Free Software
community. Please see the [WNPP pages](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/) for
the full list, and please add a note to the bug report and retitle it to ITA:
if you plan to take over a package.
