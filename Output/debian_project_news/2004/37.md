Debian Weekly News - September 21st, 2004
=========================================


Welcome to this year's 37th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. A recent issue of the German computer magazine c't features
an article about GNU/Linux on notebooks including a test of 14 current
notebook models. One machine, an ASUS M2400N, came pre-installed with
Debian GNU/Linux by [Xtops.DE](http://www.xtops.de/).


**Security-Hardening Debian.** [Debian Hardened](http://sourceforge.net/projects/debianhardened) is a
new project that [wants](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/09/msg00126.html) be
an official Debian [sub-project](https://www.debian.org/devel/). It aims at
providing a complete tree of hardened kernel and software packages for a
standard Debian distribution, without changing to another distribution like [Adamantix](http://www.adamantix.org/) and making easy the
hardening of any machine running Debian GNU/Linux.


**Ubuntu 4.10 Preview released.** Benjamin Mako Hill [announced](http://lwn.net/Articles/102248/) the first beta release of
[Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntulinux.org/) (codenamed "Warty
Warthog"). The new distribution is based on Debian and features GNOME 2.8 and
is available for the x86, AMD64, and PowerPC architectures. Ubuntu plan a new
release every 6 months, with 18 months of security updates for each [release](http://www.netsplit.com/blog/work/canonical/ubuntu_and_debian.html).
The [relationship page](http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/relationship/document_view) provides a few details on their release process.


**Updating Scanners and Filters in Debian stable.** Joey
Schulze [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00795.html) about means to update the database of virus and security scanners,
spam filters and the like for the upcoming Debian release. [Nessus](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00788.html),
and ClamAV use special plugins to update their databases, and [f-prot](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00793.html)
uses an installer package. Martin Michlmayr [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00801.html)
to modify the stable update policy instead.


**Maintaining SSL Certificates.** Kai Hendry [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00955.html)
why he should build his own certification authority (CA) since [SPI](https://www.spi-inc.org/) runs a CA and could be issuing
certificates to make Debian users' life easier. Javier FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino
PeÃ±a [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00974.html) that SPI is not a CA, but only use certificates for their own
use and maybe close projects.


**Open Software License v2.1.** Matthew Wilcox [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/09/msg00179.html)
a new discussion on version 2.1 of the [Open Software
License](http://opensource.org/licenses/osl-2.1.php) after version 2.0 was not [considered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/05/msg00118.html)
free according to the [Debian Free
Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines). Anthony DeRobertis [asserted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/09/msg00220.html)
that the new version is still not free and is conform with the [opinion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/09/msg00182.html)
of Andrew Suffield.


**Debian and Global File System?** An [article](http://newsvac.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/09/09/028214)
on Newsforge reported that the Angelo Ovidi has [released](http://xfdeb.sourceforge.net/) the first unofficial Debian
kernel packages supporting Global File System (GFS) on a 2.6.8.1 vanilla
kernel. GFS supports journaling, recovery from client failures, and many
other features. Bastian Blank has already built and uploaded the first set of
[official packages](http://lophos.multibuild.org/svn/cluster/)
to unstable, only one package is still waiting in the incoming
queue.


**Missing Source Packages in Sarge.** Jeroen van Wolffelaar [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/09/msg00210.html)
that for several binary packages the corresponding source packages are missing in the
`Sources` file. This means that there is neither a trust path from the
archive signing key, nor will it be possible to build the same version with
`apt-get -b source`.


**Installer Release Candidate Planning.** Joey Hess [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/09/msg00291.html)
that the new [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) is
in a relatively good shape for another release. He would like to declare a
new release candidate soon and tried to formulate a group goal for the [developers meeting](http://meeting.ffis.de/Oldenburg2004/) in
Oldenburg, Germany, this week, so that all developers can work on a common
task.


**Weekly CD and DVD Builds.** Santiago Garcia Mantinan [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/2004/09/msg00081.html)
that he is automatically building weekly CD and DVD images for sarge again.
They now use [JTE](http://www.einval.com/~steve/software/JTE/) to
allow for faster image generation. Because of the changed creation process,
the new images may contain new bugs, so please report any problems to the
[debian-cd](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/) mailing list.


**Sarge Release Notes.** Rob Bradford [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc/2004/09/msg00033.html)
that the [release notes](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) for sarge have
finally been written. Translators who have formerly been disappointed by the
lack of an English version can start translating the [document](http://cvs.debian.org/ddp/manuals.sgml/release-notes/?cvsroot=debian-doc).


**LSB Status in Sarge?** Martin Michlmayr [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lsb/2004/08/msg00002.html)
about the status of [Linux Standard
Base](http://www.linuxbase.org/) (LSB) in Debian sarge. Jeff Licquia [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lsb/2004/08/msg00004.html)
that he is working on LSB 2.0 already and that he anticipates issues only with
the dynamic linker, glibc, [diff](https://packages.debian.org/diff),
[coreutils](https://packages.debian.org/coreutils) and the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/).

**Debian Packages introduced last Week.** Every day, a
different Debian package is [featured](http://www.livejournal.com/users/debaday/) from the testing
distribution. If you know about an obscure package you think others should
also know about, send it to [Andrew Sweger](http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=debaday).
Debian package a day introduced the following packages last week.


* [logjam](http://www.livejournal.com/users/debaday/34629.html)

**Orphaned Packages.** 1 package was orphaned this week and
requires a new maintainer. This makes a total of 154 orphaned packages. Many
thanks to the previous maintainers who contributed to the Free Software
community. Please see the [WNPP pages](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/) for
the full list, and please add a note to the bug report and retitle it to ITA:
if you plan to take over a package.


* [regexplorer](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/regexplorer)
 -- Visual regular expression explorer.
