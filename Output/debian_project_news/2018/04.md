Welcome to the Debian Project News!
-----------------------------------


We hope that you enjoy this edition of the DPN.


For other news, please read the official Debian blog
[Bits from Debian](https://bits.debian.org), and follow
<https://micronews.debian.org> which
feeds (via RSS) the @debian profile on several social networks too.


At the end of this Project News we've added a **Quick Links** section which
links to a selection of the posts made through our other media streams.


Debian's Security Team releases current advisories on a daily basis
([Security Advisories 2018](https://www.debian.org/security/2018/)). Please
read them carefully and subscribe to the [security
mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/).


Internal News/Happenings
------------------------


**Updated Debian 9: 9.6 released**


The Debian project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2018/20181110)
the sixth update of its stable distribution Debian 9 (codename Stretch) on 10 November 2018
to point release 9.6.


This point release added corrections for security issues along with a few
adjustments for serious problems. Security advisories have already been published
separately and are referenced where available.
Upgrading an existing installation to either revision can be achieved
by pointing the package management system at one of Debian's many HTTP mirrors.
A comprehensive list of mirrors is available at: <https://www.debian.org/mirror/list>



**Package Salvaging**


Tobias Frost [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/09/msg00003.html)
a new addition to the Debian Developer's Reference on Package Salvaging.
[Package Salvaging](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/ch05.en.html#package-salvaging)
allows packages not officially orphaned or abandoned to be maintained by other
developers or new contributors after some eligibility factors are addressed.


The process differs from MIA handling of packages in that it does allow for negelected
or forgotten packages to be brought back into the fold. There is a set of [guidelines](https://wiki.debian.org/PackageSalvaging)
available which outline the phases of the process, along with additional
information and FAQs on the Debian Wiki.


**Reproducible Builds joins the Software Conservancy!**


[Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) has joined the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/about/), a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit
organisation that helps promote, develop and defend Free, Libre, and Open Source
Software (FLOSS) projects. Through the SFC, member projects may receive donations
earmarked for the benefit of a specific FLOSS project.


The Reproducible Builds project, which [began as a project](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/History) within the Debian community,
is also critical to the Conservancyâs own compliance work: A build that cannot be
verified may contain code that triggers different license compliance responsibilities
than the recipient is expecting.


As Reproducible Builds joins Conservancy, it is also receiving a donation of US$300,000
from the [Handshake Foundation](https://handshake.org/) which will propel the projectâs efforts to ensure the
future health and usability of free software.


**Rust available on 14 Debian Architectures**


John Paul Adrian Glaubitz announced and thanked the many contributors who helped
to get [Rust available on 14 Debian architectures](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/11/msg00000.html).
The [newest](https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=rustc&suite=unstable)
supported architectures are: mips, mips64el, mipsel, and powerpcspe.


This work is the result of the
combined effort of many talented people, and work on LLVM upstream which
fixed many many bugs in the MIPSand PowerPC backends as well as adding support
for the PowerPCSPE sub-target.


**Documenting copyright holders in debian/copyright**


The FTP team has issued [clarifications](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/10/msg00004.html)
in regard to copyright attribution in debian/copyright; some of the main points:


* Unless a license explicitly states that copyright attributions only apply to
source distributions, they apply as well for the source and binary. The copyright
must be documented in debian/copyright for license compliance reasons.
* Be mindful of [2.3 Copyright considerations](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#copyright-considerations): Every package must be accompanied by
a verbatim copy of its copyright information and distribution license in the file
/usr/share/doc/package/copyright.
* On rare occasion the FTP masters have determined that full copyright attribution
is both not feasible and, given the nature of the package, that an appropriate
copyright notice does not need to list all copyright holders; in such
cases this tolerance should not be assumed to apply to other packages.


The FTP team affirms that documenting copyright holders in debian/copyright is
a good idea.


**CTTE decision on vendor-specific patch series**


The technical committee [passed a resolution](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/11/msg00004.html) on whether to allow the use of
vendor-specific patch series in the Debian archive, in summary:


The Committee recognises a need for packages to behave differently when built
on different distributions, but this should be done by using differing source
packages, or as part of the build process using current and future practices
such as patches with conditional behaviour or patching of files during the build
rather than at source unpacking time.


As this feature is used by several packages today, there is the need for a
reasonable transition period. However, they will be considered buggy from
when this resolution is accepted, but will not be considered severe enough
to warrant immediate removal from Debian.


After Buster is released, the presence of a vendor-specific patch series
will be a violation of a MUST directive in Debian policy.


The Committee therefore resolves:
Any use of dpkg's vendor-specific patch series feature is a bug for packages
in the Debian archive (including contrib and non-free).


After Buster is released, use of the vendor-specific patch series feature is
forbidden in the Debian archive.


For additional information and the original discussion please see [Bug #904302](https://bugs.debian.org/904302).


**Release Team: Upcoming freeze timeline, ways to help**


The Release Team is [preparing](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/09/msg00004.html) for the initial phase of the buster freeze.


Developers are reminded to follow up on their plans and evaluate realistic
timelines to accomplish for changes and inclusion into buster.


Changes can be staged in experimental, to avoid disruption. Keep in mind
that other volunteers may not have the same capacity to work on your goals.
Any unfixed bugs are suggested to be fixed via [NMU](https://wiki.debian.org/NonMaintainerUpload) now rather than later.


The official freeze time table for buster is:


* 2019-01-12 - Transition freeze
* 2019-02-12 - Soft-freeze
* 2019-03-12 - Full-freeze


Please consult the buster [freeze policy](https://release.debian.org/buster/freeze_policy.html) and timeline for detailed information about the different types of
freezes and what they mean for you.


If you would like to help us to get buster out on time and are able to
help fix RC bugs in testing prior to the transition freeze, you can do that now
by looking at the [list of RC bugs](https://udd.debian.org/bugs/) or joining the #debian-bugs irc channel on irc.oftc.net.


**Bits from the Debian Anti-Harassment Team**


The [Debian Anti-Harassment Team](https://wiki.debian.org/AntiHarassment) is the point of contact for any community
member who would like to help create a more welcoming and respectful
environment in Debian, and is also the point of contact for reports or concerns
about inappropriate behaviour or abuse. The team will send out small but
regular reports to the community.


Should you see interactions that you consider deserve attention, please let
us know. Please do not wait until a problem becomes too big; we can assist
as friendly de-escalators or as mediators. Members may also forward
information for which no action is to be taken, but kept on file should a
problem escalate some time in the future.


The team may be contacted at [antiharassment@debian.org](mailto:antiharassment@debian.org).


Some highlights of our recent activity:


One request for intervention on a dispute about a package deemed offensive,
we issued our recommendation: Bug [#907199](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=907199)


We had a request about removing messages from mailing list and responded.


Several attendees at DebConf 18 served as a local anti-harassment team
that handled disputes between attendees and a possible Code of Conduct violation,
mediating in minor issues, and offering advice during the conference.


A general reminder about the CoC was sent via micronews several times during
DebConf18.


We have been involved in the discussions about the photo policy for DebConf,
and we plan to make a proposal soon.


**New Outreachy intern**


Debian welcomes [Anastasia Tsikoza as our newest Outreachy intern](https://bits.debian.org/2018/11/welcome-outreachy-intern-2018-2019.html). The Outreachy
program provides internships for people from groups traditionally
underrepresented in technology. Anastasia mentored by Paul Wise and Raju Devidas,
will work on Improving the integration of Debian derivatives with the Debian
infrastructure and the community.


**Misc Developer News**


Paul Wise [posted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/10/msg00002.html) the most recent issue of Misc Developer News #46, highlights
include:


debhelper compat level 12 is open for beta testing and is expected to become stable in Debian buster.


A new port for RISC-V flavour riscv64 (64-bits little-endian) is now available in Debian Ports.


With the recent release of debcargo 2.0.0 to crates.io, Debian packages can be created from your favorite Rust crate and uploaded to the Debian archive.


devscripts 2.18.5 has been released and brings some new uscan features such as verifying signed tags in git and auto value for dversionmangle.


Chris Lamb called for more volunteers for the FTP Team.

**Buster (bug) Squashing Parties!**


There are many Bug Squashing Parties coming up on our calendars that are
focusing efforts on addressing and fixing release critical bugs that will delay
the release of Debian 10 (buster). BSPs are open to everyone who wants and is
able to get involved. Come on by and help us to make this release a success!


**Netherlands, Venlo, 12 January to 13 January 2019**


Hosted at Transceptor Technology and insign.it.


Feel welcome if you want to contribute to Debian, whatever your
experience level. You don't need to be an existing Debian contributor.
Just trying to reproduce a bug and documenting your experience is
already useful.


[Announcement for Venlo BSP](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/11/msg00005.html)


 [BSP Wiki for Venlo](https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/2019/01/nl/Venlo)


**Canada, Montreal, 19 January to 20 January 2019**


Hosted at Eastern Bloc, Montreal, Canada.


Unlike the one we organised for the Stretch release, this BSP will be over a
whole weekend, so hopefully folks from other provinces in Canada and from the
USA can come. 


You can register on the wiki page where you will find information
regarding transport, accommodation, food and other useful things. Expenses to
attend this BSP should be sponsored by the Debian Project
