Welcome to the Debian Project News!
-----------------------------------


We hope that you are enjoying this edition of DPN.


For other news, please read the official Debian blog
[Bits from Debian](https://bits.debian.org), and follow
<https://micronews.debian.org> which
feeds (via-RSS) the @debian profile on several social networks.


 Debian's Security Team releases current advisories on a daily basis
([Security Advisories 2017](https://www.debian.org/security/2017/) and
[Security Advisories 2018](https://www.debian.org/security/2018/)). Please
read them carefully and subscribe to the [security mailing
 list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/).


 At the end of this Project News we've added a **Quick Links** section which
links to a selection of the posts made through our other media streams.


Internal News/Happenings
------------------------


**Updated Debian 9 and Debian 8: 9.3 and 8.10 released**


The Debian project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2017/2017120902)
the third update of its stable distribution Debian 9 (codename Stretch) on 9 December 2017
to point release 9.3.


The Debian project also [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2017/20171209)
the tenth update of its oldstable distribution Debian 8 (codenameÂ Jessie) on 9 December 2017
to point release 8.10.


These point releases added corrections for security issues
along with a few adjustments for serious problems.
Security advisories have already been published separately and are referenced where available.
Upgrading an existing installation to either revision can be achieved
by pointing the package management system at one of Debian's many HTTP mirrors.
A comprehensive list of mirrors is available at: <https://www.debian.org/mirror/list>



**FAI.me build service for installation images**


Thomas Lange has
[announced](https://lists.uni-koeln.de/pipermail/linux-fai/2017-November/011869.html) the [FAI.me build
service](https://fai-project.org/FAIme) for customised installation images. On this web page, you
can create customised images with only a few clicks. It supports
different Debian distributions, all common desktop environments,
several locales, backported kernels, and the option of entering a list
of packages. After some time you can download your own ISO
image which does a fully automatic installation using [FAI](https://fai-project.org).



**Debsources now in sources.debian.org**



The Debsources team is happy to
[announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/12/msg00000.html)
that [Debsources](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/debsources/),
which provides direct web access to the Debian operating system source code,
has been moved onto the official Debian infrastructure at
<https://sources.debian.org>.
Debsources allows users to directly browse available source packages
and to peruse and highlight portions of the source code files for
every Debian release. It provides links via [HTML](https://sources.debian.org,)
and an [API](https://sources.debian.org/doc/api/) for programmatic use.



**Debian participates in Outreachy and GSoC**


Debian welcomes three Outreachy interns:
[Juliana Oliveira](https://medium.com/@jwnx) who will work on
[reproducible builds](https://wiki.debian.org/Outreachy/Round15/Projects#Outreachy.2FRound15.2FProjects.2FReproducibleBuildsOfDebian.Reproducible_builds_for_Debian_and_free_software),
[Kira Obrezkova](https://kira385881773.wordpress.com/) who will work on
[open-source mobile technologies](https://wiki.debian.org/Outreachy/Round15/Projects#Outreachy.2FRound15.2FProjects.2FDebianOsmoCom.Debian_MobCom),
and [Renata D'Avila](https://rsip22.github.io/blog/) who will work on a
[calendar database of social events and conferences for free software developers](https://wiki.debian.org/Outreachy/Round15/Projects#Outreachy.2FRound15.2FProjects.2FSocialEventAndConferenceCalendars.A_calendar_database_of_social_events_and_conferences).


The [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) program is available due to the
efforts of Debian Developers and Donors, providing a three month internship for groups
traditionally underrepresented in technology.


Google, through its [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program,
provides students with a stipend to work over the summer months on open source
development. Debian is happy to
[announce](https://bits.debian.org/2018/01/gsoc-2018-mentors-and-co-mentors.html)
that we will be participating as a mentoring organisation this year.


We are looking for mentors and students that would like to participate. Additional
information is available on our [Summer of Code 2018 wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2018);
if you are able to mentor please contact the Debian Outreach Team via
[mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-outreach/) to join as a mentor.


**New IRC channel #debian-til**


There is a new IRC channel **#debian-til** for sharing things that you recently learned about Debian.
Quoting the topic of the channel: Share something that you've learned today
(or whenever) prefixed by "TIL" (yes, even when YIL would be "correct").
Can be something technical, social or anything else somewhat relevant to Debian - Judgement-free
zone! Post anything, however "obvious"!.
More info about the Debian IRC channels can be found in <https://wiki.debian.org/IRC>.


**Misc Developer News**


Paul Wise posted [Misc Developer News #45](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/02/msg00005.html). Highlights include debhelper compat 11,
KGB now supporting GitLab webhooks (for salsa),
the change of the mentors.debian.net FTP upload queue,
a call to review your debtags today, and Purism hardware discounts for Debian Developers.

There are [226](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=newcomer)
bugs available tagged newcomer.



More than just code
-------------------


**Contributors**



941 people and 16 teams are currently listed on the
[Debian Contributors](https://contributors.debian.org/) page for 2018.



**Discussions**


On the Debian-user mailing list, Debian user Jason asked
[how
to create a PDF-Printer from the command line](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2018/01/msg00212.html).
A large discussion covered many questions asking: Is (La)TeX text or not,
what exactly is a mimetype, why not a2ps or lp, and file bloat for PDF creation.
There are lots of tips and tricks throughout the thread for those wondering
about the same question.



Debian user Richard Hector asked about the [policy
on the wontfix bug tag used by maintainers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2018/02/msg00073.html).
The thread covered many topics and discussions about the actual output from the
date command, interactive shells, the question of what day is it
really?, the fuzzy grammar of the date string, parsers, mail LDOSUBSCRIBER, and the formail
component of procmail. A very interesting read!
