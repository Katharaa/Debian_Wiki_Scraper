**Happy 25th Anniversary Debian!**


This year's annual Debian birthday celebration, known as [DebianDay](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay), was an even
more special occasion as it marked a [quarter century](https://bits.debian.org/2018/08/debian-is-25.html) of excellence, development,
contributions, translations, software creation, advocacy, and all things Debian.
Celebrations were held all over the world and several Debian designers created
some amazing artwork, logos, posters, and images which we shared online.

**Updated Debian 9 and Debian 8: 9.5 and 8.11 released**


The Debian project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2018/20180714)
the fifth update of its stable distribution Debian 9 (codename Stretch) on 14 July 2018
to point release 9.5.


The Debian project also [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2018/20180623)
the eleventh and final update of its oldstable distribution Debian 8 (codenameÂ Jessie) on 23 June 2018
to point release 8.11.


These point releases added corrections for security issues
along with a few adjustments for serious problems.
Security advisories have already been published separately and are referenced where available.
Upgrading an existing installation to either revision can be achieved
by pointing the package management system at one of Debian's many HTTP mirrors.
A comprehensive list of mirrors is available at: <https://www.debian.org/mirror/list>



**Alioth Migration to Salsa**


Alexander Wirt [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/06/msg00001.html) that Alioth is gone after the archiving of the last remaining VCS repositories. Alioth, which ran on Fusionforge, served as the repository
for collaborative maintenance of packages in Debian from 2003 through 2018. After some
discussion and a dedicated [sprint](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/06/msg00002.html) about future
options, Alioth was replaced with a GitLab instance at [salsa.debian.org](https://salsa.debian.org)
which came out of beta testing in early 2018.



Debian Developers and projects should have already migrated over to the new
system; additional information on the migration is [available](https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa/AliothMigration).


**Debian Data Protection Team announced**


Chris Lamb [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/06/msg00000.html) the creation and delegation
of the Debian Data Protection team. The team will serve as the centralized point for queries
regarding Debian's use and care of personal information across the project and
guidance on data protection principles.


**Latest team features of Debian Package Tracker**


Raphael Hertzog [shared](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/07/msg00001.html) the latest team features of the Debian Package Tracker. New
to the tracker are helpful attributes for email address team identification,
discussion subscriptions, and automatic maintainer and uploader fields along
with many other features.


**vmdebootstrap to be removed September 2018**


Lars Wirzenius [encouraged](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/07/msg00002.html) users of the vmdebootstrap package to switch to
other available tools prior to its removal from the archive September 2018.
The package, used for automatically building system images, is
somewhat difficult to modify and test due to its architecture. As other
tools are available users are advised to change now.


**Debian Policy 4.2.0.0 released**


Sean Whitton [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/08/msg00000.html) Debian Policy 4.2.0.0 being released and uploaded to sid. The announcement details the changes from Policy 4.1.5.
[The Debian Policy Manual](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/) deals with the structure and contents
of the Debian archive, technical requirements each package must satisfy to be included in
the archive, and the package management system developers have to be conversant with.


**DebConf18 Videos are available**


Video recordings from DebConf18 are [available](https://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2018/DebConf18/); special thanks to the DebConf
Video Team for their amazing work covering this event.
Wouter Verhelst [wrote](https://grep.be/blog//en/life/debian/DebConf18_video_work/) about the software used for the transcoding and the
different formats available for download. The schedule page on the DebConf18
[website](https://debconf18.debconf.org/schedule/) now also includes the recordings in each talk page using HTML5 video.


**New and noteworthy packages**



[Among
many other packages that were added to the unstable Debian archive](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/newpkg) in the past weeks,
we can find:


* [astroid (0.13-3) - Graphical notmuch email client](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/astroid)

Newcomer bugs

contributors to use as an entry point to working on specific packages.
There are currently [203](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=newcomer)
bugs available tagged newcomer.



More than just code
-------------------


Jonathan McDowell [shared](https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2018/06/alexa-assistant.html)
a write-up entitled Hooking up Home Assistant to Alexa and Google Assistant which details how to set up home automation and required
authentication, with a few critical security steps to avoid being another
insecure device on the IoT.


Benjamin Mako Hill [blogged](https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/libreplanet-2018-keynote) on
How markets coopted free software's most powerful weapon
which highlights the methodology of current business development models which
use the same tools that enabled the large scale development of free culture
and free software. The talk was also the keynote at LibrePlanet 2018.


Ana Guerrero Lopez [introduced](https://ekaia.org/blog/2018/07/03/introducing-debos/) us to
[debos](https://github.com/go-debos/debos), a versatile image generator. The tool,
used to build software images, makes the task easy by using recipe files in YAML
to create highly customized images. 


**Contributors**



1,484 people and 19 teams are currently listed on the
[Debian Contributors](https://contributors.debian.org/) page for 2018.



**Discussions**


From the Debian-user mailing list serveral interesting questions were asked:


HP Garcia asked about [Verifying Digital Signatures](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2018/06/msg00239.html).
Fellow Debian users contributed to the discussion with pointers on how to check and keep keys
and signatures current.


Pierre Couderc asked [How to apt update from an USB key?](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2018/07/msg00420.html)
Readers can learn about other tried and proven methods to update sources and packages for computer systems with limited access.


Martin Drecher asked about [use of su vs sudo?](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2018/08/msg00226.html)
Always a hot topic for administrators, this question introduces best practices and includes some of a history of how/when passwords are used during the initial Debian system installation and the effects on the system afterward.


Richard Owlett asked about [Installing package NOT in repository](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2018/08/msg00595.html). This longer discussion talks about the installation of .deb files,
install pathname arguments, dependency checking, dpkg, apt, and cached personal
survival notes.


**Tips and Tricks**


Petter Reinholdtsen shared a tip on doing a [Debian APT upgrade without enough free space](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_APT_upgrade_without_enough_free_space_on_the_disk___.html)
on the disk. The blog post includes a script and other methods for upgrades when
storage space is limited.


Arturo Borrero GonzÃ¡lez highlights [Things you can do with Debian, Multimedia editing.](http://ral-arturo.org/2018/07/19/multimedia.html)
