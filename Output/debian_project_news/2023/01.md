Debian Project News - August 5th, 2023
======================================


Welcome to the inaugural issue of Debian Project Bits!
------------------------------------------------------


Welcome to this year's first issue of DPN, the newsletter for the Debian community.


Those remembering the Debian Weekly News (DwN) will recognize some of the
sections here which served as our inspiration.


Debian Project Bits posts will allow for a faster turnaround of some project
news on a monthly basis. The [Debian Micronews](https://micronews.debian.org/)
service will continue to share shorter news items, the
[Debian Project News](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/)
remains as our official newsletter which may move to a biannual archive format.


News
----


**Debian Day**


The Debian Project was [officially founded](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianHistory)
by Ian Murdock on August 16, 1993. Since then we have celebrated our Anniversary
of that date each year with events around the world. We would love it if you
could join our revels this very special year as we have the honor of turning
**30**!


Attend or organize a local [Debian Day](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay)
celebration. You are invited to plan your own event: from Bug Squashing parties
to Key Signing parties, Meet-Ups, or any type of social event whether large or
small. And be sure to check our
[Debian reimbursement How To](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DPL/Reimbursement)
if you need such resources.


You can share your days, events, thoughts, or notes with us and the rest of
the community with the **#debianday** tag that will be used across most
[social media platforms](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DebianSocial).
See you then!

Releases
--------


**Stable Release**


Debian 12 [bookworm](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBookworm) was released on
[June 10, 2023](https://www.debian.org/News/2023/20230610). This new version
becomes the stable release of Debian and moves the prior Debian 11
[bullseye](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBullseye) release to
[oldstable status](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianOldStable). The Debian
community celebrated the release with 23
[Release Parties](https://wiki.debian.org/ReleasePartyBookworm) all around the
world.


Bookworm's first point release [12.1](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases)
address miscellaneous bug fixes affecting 88 packages, documentation, and
installer updates was made available on
[July 22, 2023](https://www.debian.org/News/2023/20230722).


**RISC-V support**


[riscv64](https://wiki.debian.org/RISC-V) has recently been added to the
official Debian architectures for support of 64-bit little-endian
[RISC-V](https://riscv.org) hardware running the Linux kernel. We expect
to have full riscv64 support in Debian 13 trixie. Updates on bootstrap, build
daemon, porterbox, and development progress were recently shared by the team in a
[Bits from the Debian riscv64 porters](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2023/07/msg00003.html)
post.


**non-free-firmware**


The Debian 12 bookworm archive now includes non-free-firmware; please be
sure to update your apt sources.list if your systems requires such components
for operation. If your previous sources.list included non-free for this
purpose it may safely be removed.


**apt sources.list**


The Debian archive holds several components:


* [main](http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive#s-main): Contains
[DFSG](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)-compliant packages,
which do not rely on software outside this area to operate.
* [contrib](http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive#s-contrib):
Contains packages that contain DFSG-compliant software, but have dependencies
not in main.
* [non-free](http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive#s-non-free):
Contains software that does not comply with the DFSG.
* non-free-firmware: Firmware that is otherwise not part of the Debian system
to enable use of Debian with hardware that requires such firmware.

Security Advisories
-------------------


Debian's Security Team releases current advisories on a daily basis.
Some recently released advisories concern these packages:


* [trafficserver](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5435-2)
Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Apache Traffic Server, a
reverse and forward proxy server, which could result in information
disclosure or denial of service.
* [asterisk](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5438)
A flaw was found in Asterisk, an Open Source Private Branch Exchange. A
buffer overflow vulnerability affects users that use PJSIP DNS resolver.
This vulnerability is related to CVE-2022-24793. The difference is that
this issue is in parsing the query record `parse\_query()`, while the issue
in CVE-2022-24793 is in `parse\_rr()`. A workaround is to disable DNS
resolution in PJSIP config (by setting `nameserver\_count` to zero) or use
an external resolver implementation instead.
* [flask](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5442)
It was discovered that in some conditions the Flask web framework may
disclose a session cookie.
* [chromium](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5456)
Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium, which could result
in the execution of arbitrary code, denial of service or information
disclosure.


Other
-----


**Popular packages**


* [gpgv - GNU privacy guard
signature verification tool](https://packages.debian.org/stable/gpgv). 99,053 installations. gpgv is actually a
stripped-down version of gpg which is only able to check signatures. It is
somewhat smaller than the fully-blown gpg and uses a different (and simpler)
way to check that the public keys used to make the signature are valid. There
are no configuration files and only a few options are implemented.
* [dmsetup - Linux Kernel
Device Mapper userspace library](https://packages.debian.org/stable/dmsetup). 77,769 installations. The Linux Kernel
Device Mapper is the LVM (Linux Logical Volume Management) Team's implementation
of a minimalistic kernel-space driver that handles volume management, while
keeping knowledge of the underlying device layout in user-space. This makes it
useful for not only LVM, but software raid, and other drivers that create
virtual block devices.
* [sensible-utils - Utilities
for sensible alternative selection](https://packages.debian.org/stable/sensible-utils). 96,001 daily users. This package
provides a number of small utilities which are used by programs to sensibly
select and spawn an appropriate browser, editor, or pager. The specific
utilities included are: sensible-browser sensible-editor sensible-pager.
* [popularity-contest -
The popularity-contest package](https://packages.debian.org/stable/popularity-contest). 90,758 daily users. The popularity-contest
package sets up a cron job that will periodically anonymously submit to the
Debian developers statistics about the most used Debian packages on the system.
This information helps Debian make decisions such as which packages should go on
the first CD. It also lets Debian improve future versions of the distribution so
that the most popular packages are the ones which are installed automatically
for new users.


**New and noteworthy packages in unstable**


* [Toolkit
for scalable simulation of distributed applications](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/libsimgrid3.34) SimGrid is a toolkit
that provides core functionalities for the simulation of distributed
applications in heterogeneous distributed environments. SimGrid can be used as
a Grid simulator, a P2P simulator, a Cloud simulator, a MPI simulator, or a
mix of all of them. The typical use-cases of SimGrid include heuristic
evaluation, application prototyping, and real application development and
tuning. This package contains the dynamic libraries and runtime.
* [LDraw mklist program](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/ldraw-mklist)
3D CAD programs and rendering programs using the LDraw parts library of LEGO
parts rely on a file called parts.lst containing a list of all available parts.
The program ldraw-mklist is used to generate this list from a directory of
LDraw parts.
* [Open
Lighting Architecture - RDM Responder Tests](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/ola-rdm-tests) The DMX512 standard for Digital
MultipleX is used for digital communication networks commonly used to control
stage lighting and effects. The Remote Device Management protocol is an
extension to DMX512, allowing bi-directional communication between RDM-compliant
devices without disturbing other devices on the same connection. The Open
Lighting Architecture (OLA) provides a plugin framework for distributing DMX512
control signals. The ola-rdm-tests package provides an automated way to check
protocol compliance in RDM devices.
* [parsec-service](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/parsec-service)
Parsec is an abstraction layer that can be used to interact with hardware-backed
security facilities such as the Hardware Security Module (HSM), the Trusted
Platform Module (TPM), as well as firmware-backed and isolated software
services. The core component of Parsec is the security service, provided by this
package. The service is a background process that runs on the host platform and
provides connectivity with the secure facilities of that host, exposing a
platform-neutral API that can be consumed into different programming languages
using a client library. For a client library implemented in Rust see the package
librust-parsec-interface-dev.
* [Simple network calculator and lookup tool](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/ripcalc)
Process and lookup network addresses from the command line or CSV with ripalc.
Output has a variety of customisable formats.
* [High performance,
open source CPU/GPU miner and RandomX benchmark](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/xmrig)
XMRig is a high performance, open source, cross platform RandomX, KawPow,
CryptoNight, and GhostRider unified CPU/GPU miner and RandomX benchmark.
* [Ping,
but with a graph - Rust source code](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/librust-gping-dev) This package contains the source for the
Rust gping crate, packaged by debcargo for use with cargo and dh-cargo.
