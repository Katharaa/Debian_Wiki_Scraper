Philip Kern announced [the
upcoming release of Debian GNU/Linux 6.0.2](https://lists.debian.org/debian-stable-announce/2011/06/msg00000.html). This update, scheduled
for Saturday, June 25th, will mainly add corrections for security
problems to stable release, along with some adjustments for serious problems.



Spreading the world
-------------------



Christian Perrier published his [annual report about the number of developers per country](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2011/06/12#devel-countries-201106-3).
Among these numbers, we can noticed that [Debian
developers are present](https://www.debian.org/devel/developers.loc) in fifty-seven countries.
Twenty-three more active Debian developers have been
counted this year, along with two more countries.



New IRC Training Sessions
-------------------------



The Debian Project started a [new round of
IRC Training Sessions](https://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110617), which will be held on IRC by experienced community members.
This time, there will be two different series: non-technical, called Ask the ... and
more technical One day with ....
Additional information and scheduled sessions
are always available on the related [wiki
page](https://wiki.debian.org/IRC/debian-meeting).




The first session, held on June 22th and featuring Stefano Zacchiroli,

asked Stefano various interesting questions; it is also available the [log

Report from the Debian Edu developer meeting
--------------------------------------------



Holger Levsen sent a [report from the Debian Edu developer gathering in Hamburg, Germany.](https://lists.debian.org/201106141624.46478.holger@layer-acht.org)
The main goal of the sprint was preparing the release of Debian Edu Squeeze.
Debian Edu developers discussed and worked on various things like documentation,
Samba integration, and testing of Squeeze installation images.
More than 200 commits were pushed to the Debian Edu's Subversion repository and 18 bugs fixed (and a bunch of
bugs filed against bugs.skolelinux.org). Participants also had a long discussion with two persons
from Chaos macht Schule, which is a CCC subproject. In the end of his mail Holger thanks
CCC Hamburg, Opensides.be, the OLPC.de association and the Debian sprints
program for their financially supporting the event.



Meet Planet Debian Derivatives!
-------------------------------



Paul Wise [blogged about creation](http://bonedaddy.net/pabs3/log/2011/06/16/planet-debian-derivatives/) of [Planet
Debian Derivatives](https://planet.debian.org/deriv/) which aggregates the blogs and planets of all the distributions
represented in the derivatives census. As say Paul it's first concrete outcome from the [Debian derivatives census](https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census). He also
shared his plans about integration of information about derivatives with Debian
infrastructure and thanks JÃ¶rg Jaspert for doing the necessary setup procedures.



Squeeze debian-installer with Linux 2.6.38
------------------------------------------



Kenshi Muto announced the [release

contain firmwares. Also Kenshi added in the image a new DHCP client which fixes an interacting
problem with some DHCP servers. Please note that this is an unofficial image and you should
use it only if you really need this.



DebConf11: Call for keys for keysigning
---------------------------------------



AnÃ­bal Monsalve Salazar sent an announcement about [organization
of keysigning at DebConf11](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/06/msg00001.html) which will be held at Banja Luka, Republika Srpska,

Graphical installer for Debian GNU/kFreeBSD
-------------------------------------------



Robert Millan announced that [a
graphical installer is now available for Debian GNU/kFreeBSD](https://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2011/06/msg00187.html): with it
is now possible to install Wheezy in a more comfortable way. You
can find it on the [daily
images page](https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/kfreebsd-amd64/daily/netboot/gtk/).



Iceweasel 5.0 in experimental
-----------------------------



Mike Hommey blogged about [adding
Iceweasel 5.0 to experimental](http://glandium.org/blog/?p=2108). Mike also noticed that he discontinued
the Iceweasel 4.0 backport for Squeeze, but he will still backports patches
to 3.5 in Squeeze and 3.0 in Lenny. At the end of the post he added:
In the coming weeks, there will also be some additional changes to the [mozilla.debian.net](http://mozilla.debian.net/) repository, but Iâll
give more details when that happens.



Further interviews
------------------


There has been
two further People behind Debian interview: with
[Philipp
Kern](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/06/10/people-behind-debian-philipp-kern/), Stable Release Manager and member of the wanna-build team; and with

Other news
----------



Christian Perrier noticed that the [bug #630000](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2011/06/10#630000) has been reported Friday, 10 Jun 2011.




Daniel Barlow blogged about
[how
to clone a Debian system](https://www.debian-administration.org/article/669/Cloning_a_Debian_system_-_identical_packages_and_versions) installing on it identical packages and
versions.




Martin Zobel-Helas wrote an interesting article on [how
start contributing to Debian](http://blog.zobel.ftbfs.de/2011/06/how-you-can-help-debian-1.html). He listed various ways to help Debian:
from reporting bugs and try to reproduce them, to write documentation or
translate the existing one, to organize events or deliver talk on
Debian-related topics. And, if you haven't time to actively work with
Debian, you could always help it donating money or hardware. As Martin
said: Find your own area to work on within
Debian, and don't think you can't help. Even graphic designers, lawyers
or clerks can help Debian!.
