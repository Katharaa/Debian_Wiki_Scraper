The Debian Project mourns the loss of Adrian von Bidder
-------------------------------------------------------



The Debian Project lost [Adrian
von Bidder](https://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110423), who was involved in Debian, represented the project
at numerous events and was one of the founding members and current
secretary of [debian.ch](https://debian.ch).
He also founded the [NTP
Pool](http://www.pool.ntp.org/en/) (crowd-sourced time synchronisation), which our project
has since fully adopted.



Upcoming changes for the Linux kernels on the i386 architecture
---------------------------------------------------------------



Ben Hutchings announced some [upcoming changes](http://womble.decadent.org.uk/blog/upcoming-changes-in-debian-linux-packages-for-i386.html) for the [Linux kernels](https://packages.debian.org/src:linux-2.6) in the
[i386 architecture](https://www.debian.org/ports/i386/) (aka
32-bit PC). The most notable change with the 2.6.39 kernel packages will be
the drop of the 686 flavour, even so it's the most widely used. Ben
explains that only a very limited set of processors are not
able to use the 686-bigmem flavour, which has less limitations and
supports more that 4GB of RAM (on top of some other benefits). He also
points out that these processors not supported by the 686-bigmem flavour
seem to gain performance with the 486 flavour. Without the
686 flavour, the 686-bigmem will be renamed to
686-pae.




He also said, that the amd64 flavour will be dropped as soon as
migration from a 32-bit userland with 64-bit kernel to a 64-bit userland
with 64-bit kernel is implemented and has been tested.




Before that, Ben blogged about [changes
introduced with 2.6.38](http://womble.decadent.org.uk/blog/recent-changes-in-debian-linux-packages.html) kernels. One change is the introduction of a [user space daemon](https://packages.debian.org/crda) providing the
kernel with country specific regulations for wireless usage from a [database](https://packages.debian.org/wireless-regdb).



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Ignoring the [result
of his reelection](https://www.debian.org/vote/2011/vote_001), Stefano Zacchiroli sent his [last bits from the DPL](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/04/msg00010.html), where he was glad to refer to the [Debian Derivatives Exchange
project](https://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110318) recently launched and the high activity on the [debian-devel](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/) and [debian-project](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/)
mailing lists.
He enjoyed spreading the Debian verb in Bosnia, Taiwan and France; and
is looking forward at the [LinuxTag in Berlin](http://www.linuxtag.org/2011/), the [Greek Free and Open Source Software Society](http://www.ellak.gr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6874/) conference and
the [Ubuntu Developer Summit](http://uds.ubuntu.com/).
Stefano discussed the relationships with others: the GNOME Foundation
invited Debian at the [GNOME.Asia summit](http://www.gnome.asia/) where Josselin Mouette attended on behalf of
Debian, John Sullivan who become the new executive director at FSF,
and Graziano Sorbaioli, the gNewSense community manager.
He finally kept us posted about the upcoming DebConf preparation,
sprints and other expenses.




After being reelected as Debian Project Leader, Stefano Zacchiroli sent his [first bits from the DPL in this term](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/05/msg00000.html):
**Thanks!** I'm flattered by the support and trust in me you
have shown. It's a honor to be confirmed as Debian Project Leader, as
well as it's a honor to represent Debian before the Debian community and
the world out there. I'll try very hard not to disappoint any of you.
Stefano described what is the DPL role and how people can help and contact him.



Berkeley Database plans for the future
--------------------------------------



Ondřej Surý reported from the [plans of the Berkeley DB maintainers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/04/msg01030.html) to [reduce the number of
BDB versions](https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/BerkeleyDB) shipped in stable releases. Debian 5 Lenny and
Debian 6 Squeeze both contained three different versions which where
needed to supported during the release as well as during upgrades, which
was often quite difficult. In the future, each stable release should have
only one version as default as well as the tools for the previous one to
ensure smooth upgrades.



Mono 2.10.1 now in experimental
-------------------------------



Mirco Bauer notified us about his recent [upload of Mono 2.10.1 into Debian's experimental](http://www.meebey.net/posts/the_big_split_mono_2.10_debian_packaging/)
branch. The biggest change from a packaging point of view is making Mono
even more modular with one library per package.
This reduces the install size.



Report from FAI developer meeting
---------------------------------



Michael Prokop blogged about the [FAI
developer meeting](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2011/04/21/report-from-fai-developer-meeting-042011/) held last month in Cologne, Germany.
The meeting was very fruitful: as Michael reported, during the two days were
made 134 Subversion commits, regarding a new release candidate version, various
website improvements, and the documentation.
The team has also discussed about the release management (deciding to use
3.4.x version as long term stable release and 4.x as developer version) and
has defined its future goals.



The popcon problem
------------------



Joey Hess wrote [an interesting
post about popcon](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/the_popcon_problem/) where analyzes various issues regarding the use of the [Debian Popularity Contest](https://popcon.debian.org/).
First of all, noticed Joey, there's a measuring problem: popcon units are
unknown and the only way to resolve this ambiguity is the use of ratios of
values.
Also, it is deceptive to compare popcon scores of packages with different
functions and targets: in fact, some packages are installed by default on a
wide range of machines, while others are more specific.
At the end, Joey noticed that one of the most interesting aspect of Debian is that
you can find in it even uncommon and specific — but not necessarily popular or
widespread — software: so, every removal of a
package for low popcon score runs the risk of silently degrading this
overall value of Debian.



Further interviews
------------------


There has been
a further People behind Debian interview with
[Meike Reichle](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/04/21/people-behind-debian-meike-reichle-member-of-debian-women/), Press Officer and member of the Debian Women project.

the new systemd packages](http://debian-administration.org/users/dkg/weblog/78) available for Debian Sid and
experimental. While he agrees that systemd seems to get some
things right, he's a bit concerned about the Linux-centricism of
systemd and the general bloat of it.

In the following discussion, it was agreed to be a good idea, but it should
ensured that there were no regressions.
