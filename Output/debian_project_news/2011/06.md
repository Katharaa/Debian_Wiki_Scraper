Bits from the Release Team — Kicking off Wheezy
-----------------------------------------------



Neil McGovern sent some [bits from the Release Team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/03/msg00016.html) calling for feedback on the recent release.
He also addresses various subjects that are currently under discussion:
time-based freezes, transitions, release goals, sprint organisation and
0-day NMU policy.




Luk Claes proposed (amongst other ideas) continuing the [removal of obsolete libraries](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2011/03/msg00492.html). Josselin Mouette suggested [starting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2011/03/msg00493.html) with [HAL](https://packages.debian.org/src:hal) and
`[gnome-vfs](https://packages.debian.org/src:gnome-vfs)`.
Although there has been some progress towards getting rid of HAL (still used by
`[xserver-xorg](https://packages.debian.org/xserver-xorg)`
on kFreeBSD), Cyril Brulebois pointed out that [this effort is stalled for now](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg01194.html).
Christian Perrier also proposed to [drop](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg01166.html) `[defoma](https://packages.debian.org/defoma)`.




[Limitations](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg01146.html) in `[ifupdown](https://packages.debian.org/ifupdown)`
led to calls for an
[overhaul](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg01167.html) of Debian's default network management infrastructure.
`[network-manager](https://packages.debian.org/network-manager)`
[could
be adopted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/04/msg00041.html) to this end, though this proposal has provoked a great many
objections, whether
[rational](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/04/msg00051.html) or [less so](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/04/msg00120.html).




Among other [release goal proposals](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg01136.html) (such as read-only root file system and
C.UTF-8 provided by default), Roger Leigh started a [discussion about supporting `/run` for Wheezy](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg01118.html).



Stefano Zacchiroli proposed [some further release goals](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2011/03/msg00510.html) relating to package quality, and relaunched the
[time based freezes](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/04/msg00091.html) proposal. He argued that fixed freeze dates would
allow Debian's developer base to improve planning and coordination with
upstream developers, and underlined that the first part of the
Squeeze freeze (blocking library transitions while being lax about
general migration of new packages) was quite successful, and that it
should be done similarly in the future. While the time frame for such
freezes (and [how
they should be announced](https://lists.debian.org/20110404070550.GL21476@rivendell.home.ouaza.com)) is still being discussed, there generally seems to be a
[consensus
in favour](https://lists.debian.org/20110407160009.GA25468@upsilon.cc).



Registration now open for DebConf11 and call for contributions
--------------------------------------------------------------



Gunnar Wolf announced the [opening of DebConf11 registration](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/04/msg00005.html).
[Registration
instructions](https://debconf11.debconf.org/register.xhtml) are available and the deadline for sponsored food and
accommodation is 8 May 2011. A [call for contributions](https://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110408) has also been sent, and the organisers
welcome all sort of submissions: performances, art installations,
debates, or anything else can be proposed as well as traditional talks.
There will be a poster session this year.
More information on submissions of events or posters is available on
the [DebConf11
website](https://debconf11.debconf.org/cfp.xhtml) and the deadline for submissions is also 8 May 2011.



Report from the FTP Master meeting
----------------------------------



Jörg Jaspert sent a [report
from the FTP Master meeting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/03/msg00015.html) which was held at Linux Hotel in Essen,
21–27 March. During the meeting a lot of work was done, in
various areas:



* an upgrade of the main archive machine (as well as backports and
security machines) to Squeeze was performed;
* the update frequency
of the DD accessible copy of the `dak` installation (moved from
merkel.debian.org to ries.debian.org) was changed to
reflect the database changes immediately
* a new field (`Built-Using`) was implemented in `dak`
and a related patch for `[dpkg](https://packages.debian.org/dpkg)` has been prepared
* the creation of the `Maintainers` and `Uploaders` files
was sped up (from roughly 15 minutes to about a minute)
* the project of enabling autosigning for the buildds has finally been completed
* binary-all `dists` files were added



Meanwhile, in a discussion with the Debian GNU/Hurd porters it was
decided that the Hurd port will stay on ftp-master.debian.org
until Wheezy is released, while the alpha port will be completely
removed from Debian and the hppa port will move over to debian-ports.org.
As a side note, Jörg added that during the meeting Ansgar Burchardt was
appointed to the post of FTP Assistant; congratulations, Ansgar!



The Canterbury Project: an amazing example of
cross-distro collaboration
------------------------------------------------------------------------



Gerfried Fuchs blogged from [behind
the scenes of one of the most hilarious — and well orchestrated —
April Fools' pranks of this year: the Canterbury Project](http://rhonda.deb.at/blog/debian/the-canterbury-project.html). As you probably
noticed, on the morning of April the first, the homepages of Arch Linux,
Debian, Gentoo, Grml and OpenSUSE were replaced by a [placeholder](https://www.debian.org/misc/canterbury) announcing the
merging of all these distributions into one new one.
In the posting, Gerfried said that the initial idea was to simply do a sort of
exchange of homepages between participants. Then the thing happened which
the Free Software community is so well known for: additional ideas came in,
two people independently addressed me whether it wouldn't be better that
instead of a circle replacement of the frontpage, why not display the same
page on all of them. And one of them added that a corresponding news item
might make sense. said Gerfried. Another example of new ideas coming
up during the whole Canterbury Project was the introduction of the [cant package manager](https://packages.debian.org/cant) (see also
[Alexander's
blog for details](http://blog.schmehl.info/Debian/cant-package-manager)).
Gerfried revealed also the reason behind the name Canterbury: it was
adopted when Alexander Reichle-Schmehl noticed that, according to the
relevant [Wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day), the earliest recorded association between April 1 and foolishness
can be found in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (1392).
As a final note, Gerfried added that even if the all-in-one distribution was only
a joke, the cross-distro collaboration was real and exciting, and thanked all
the participants for their efforts.



Report from Med@Tel
-------------------


Andreas Tille sent a [report
from the Med@Tel conference](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2011/04/msg00024.html) held in Luxembourg and dedicated to medicine
informatics. This year, Andreas delivered a talk titled [Benefits of
Free/Libre Open Source Software in Health Care (FLOSS-HC): Communities,
Collaboration, Development Issues, Technology Transfer](https://people.debian.org/~tille/talks/201104_luxembourg), based on a
paper written by the Debian Med team. As Andreas reported, the talk was well
received and the main impression is that the Debian Med Blend itself is
considered as a really helpful and needed thing. It also seems that
Debian Med and other important — and very useful — Blends are little known
by the wider public.
For this reason, Andreas proposed to use microblogging to better promote the existence of
Debian Med and — in the following thread — [many
other ways to improve the visibility of Debian Blends](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2011/04/msg00032.html).



Further interviews
------------------


Since the last issue of the Debian Project News,
two new issues of the [This week in
 Debian podcast](https://wiki.debian.org/ThisWeekInDebian) have been published: with [Jonathan
Nadeau](http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-24), about current Debian news; and with [Roberto
Sanchez](http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-25), who gave a talk at the Northeast GNU/Linux Fest.



There have also been
two further People behind Debian interviews: with
[Bdale Garbee](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/03/28/people-behind-debian-bdale-garbee-chair-of-the-technical-committee/), chair of the technical committee; and with
[Adam D. Barratt](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/04/07/people-behind-debian-adam-d-barratt-release-manager/), release manager.



Other news
----------



Steve McIntyre made available online a new [cdimage search tool](https://cdimage-search.debian.org) that
has knowledge of just about all the Debian CDs and DVDs produced by
Debian since the Woody release, covering all the official releases
(both older archived releases and the current stable release)
and the current sets of daily and weekly testing builds.




 Stefano Zacchiroli has just been [reelected as Debian Project Leader](https://www.debian.org/vote/2011/vote_001), supported by

 Congratulations, and keep up the good work!



Guido Günther sent some [bits
from the fourth Debian Groupware Meeting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/04/msg00003.html), held
at the Linux Hotel in Essen, Germany. During the weekend the group has fixed
various issues (mostly related to [gnome-shell](https://packages.debian.org/gnome-shell) in [iceowl](https://packages.debian.org/iceowl)), and has been able to push
new versions of [icedove](https://packages.debian.org/icedove) and [iceowl](https://packages.debian.org/iceowl) to unstable and to resurrect the
[iceowl-l10n](https://packages.debian.org/iceowl-l10n) language packs. Some work was also done on [Citadel](https://packages.debian.org/src:citadel), Z-Push and
SOGo.


Raj Mathur sent a [report
about a large Debian installation in India](http://www.mail-archive.com/ilugd@lists.linux-delhi.org/msg28166.html): the installation involved
about 2,500 desktops and 40 servers, on which were installed Squeeze and
Wheezy. The installation was done in six different locations in India for a large call-out
business headquartered in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. Well done!


Cyril Brulebois published the [eighth](http://blog.ikibiki.org/2011/04/03/DXN-8/), [ninth](http://blog.ikibiki.org/2011/04/10/DXN-9/) and [tenth](http://blog.ikibiki.org/2011/04/11/DXN-10/) issues of his
