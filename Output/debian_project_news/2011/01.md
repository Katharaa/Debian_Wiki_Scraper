Squeeze Deep Freeze
-------------------


Neil McGovern writes in an [recent
email](https://lists.debian.org/20101213202220.GF3191@halon.org.uk):
Following the plan outlined in the [previous
release update](https://lists.debian.org/20101114192542.GC3191@halon.org.uk), we are
now in deep freeze, which means that we'll only be migrating to testing
packages that fix RC bugs. A deep freeze is one of the last phases
before a release of Debian. There is lots of bug fixing and documentation
still to do and you can help. Check out the [New in Squeeze page](https://wiki.debian.org/NewInSqueeze)
for example; and if you
find bugs in the installer help report and even fix them. 


Debian Installer 6.0 RC1 release
--------------------------------



The first release candidate of the installer for Debian Squeeze was [released
on January 12](https://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110113).
Many fixes are included in this release of the installer, along with new
improvements: better OS and partition detection, new supported hardware, etc.




The [errata](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/errata)
collects details and a full list of known issues.
You are encouraged to test the installer and report bugs;
media and further information are available on the [Debian Installer
pages](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer).



Debian 6.0 Squeeze to be released with completely free Linux kernel
-------------------------------------------------------------------


As the Debian project announced, the upcoming stable release Debian 6.0
Squeeze will be shipped with a [completely free Linux
kernel](https://www.debian.org/News/2010/20101215) - thus achieving a long term goal which was already set for
Debian 4.0 Etch and 5.0 Lenny. Thanks to the work of the
[Debian Kernel team](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianKernel) and
various upstream Linux developers, non-free firmware files have been split
off; instead of being integral parts of the kernel, these files may now be
shipped separately and loaded at runtime if needed. This provides a
free system to those who wish to have one, while allowing those who
need the non-free firmware files still to use them.


Steve McIntyre, lead of Debian's CD team, added that [unofficial CD
images](http://blog.einval.com/2010/12/15#CDs_with_firmware) have been created, containing non-free but distributable firmware
files, while USB-installations have already supported loading additional
firmware files for some time. More details can be found in the [Debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/Firmware).


Debian Project leader Stefano Zacchiroli also blogged a bit about the [background
of the changes](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2010/12/squeeze_your_non-free_firmware_away/).


Machine-readable format for debian/copyright files
--------------------------------------------------


Lars Wirzenius [announced](https://lists.debian.org/1294581615.20273.71.camel@havelock.lan)
that [Debian Enhancement
Proposal 5, specifying a machine-readable
format for the copyright information of a Debian package](https://dep-team.pages.debian.net/deps/dep5/), has reached
candidate status, meaning that discussion about the format has been
settled and no major changes are expected anymore: it is ready to be
used.


[Debian's policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/) mandates that Debian
software packages must come with copyright information of the source
code used, but no specific format is mandated. Most packages come with a
freeform text file, making it hard to process this information
automatically.


Bits from the Debian Project Leader
-----------------------------------


Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli sent new [bits from
the DPL](https://lists.debian.org/20101224144600.GA336@upsilon.cc). Besides mentioning various talks and interviews he gave, he
announced a new contact point for participants at Debian events:
[antiharassment@debian.org](mailto:antiharassment@debian.org). An
anti-harassment policy for Debian sprints (based upon a draft for such a
policy for [DebConf](http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/StandardsOfRespect)) is about
to follow soon.


He also mentioned that he had approved two sprints, one for the Web Team
(which has already been taken place) and one for the Security Team (which
is forthcoming), as well as several cross-distribution collaboration
activities, such as [organizing
a cross-distro face to face meeting to discuss the topic of integrating
third party applications](https://lists.debian.org/20101223084135.GB15864@upsilon.cc) on top of FOSS distributions, à la
Software Center/App Store.


Further documentation on Emdebian: components and filters
---------------------------------------------------------


Continuing his intermittent series on Emdebian, [Neil
Williams described Emdebian's concepts of components and filters](http://www.linux.codehelp.co.uk/serendipity/index.php?/archives/218-Documenting-Emdebian-components-and-filters.html). As
the package data files of Debian's main distribution have become too large to be
sanely handled on embedded systems, Emdebian Grip therefore subdivides
Debian's main repository to minimize cached data, so that systems not using any
Java components (for instance) don't need to download and cache metadata
for Java-related packages. Neil also explained in detail further filtering
techniques used by Emdebian.


Two new Debian Women tutorials
------------------------------


The Debian Women project published two new tutorials. In the first
tutorial Gerfried
Fuchs gave an [introduction
to Debian's bug tracking system](https://wiki.debian.org/HowtoUseBTS), including
explanation of the different tags and usage of package version information
by the bug tracking system.
  

In the second tutorial, Enrico
Zini introduced the [various
information sources about Debian
packages](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianPackageInformation), ranging from data available through Debian's package
repositories, over debtags and various package tracking tools to the
package tracking system.



Further This week in Debian interviews
--------------------------------------


Since the last issue of the Debian Project News, five new issues of the
[This week in
Debian podcast](https://wiki.debian.org/ThisWeekInDebian) have been published: with
[Asheesh
Laroia](http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-11), member of the Debian Mentor Community; with
[Dave
Yates](http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-12), host of the [Lotta
Linux Links Podcast](http://lottalinuxlinks.com/podcast/); with
[George
Castro](http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-13), discussing Ubuntu as a Debian derivative; with
[Jonathan
Nadeau](http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-14), about the latest Debian news, and the upcoming release of Squeeze; and with
[Rhonda](http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-15),
member of Debian's Webmaster Team, discussing the updated
Debian Website, due for the release of Squeeze.



There have also been two new people behind Debian interviews: with
[Mehdi
Dogguy](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/12/23/people-behind-debian-mehdi-dogguy-release-assistant/), who became a member of Debian's Release team barely a year
after first becoming a Debian Developer, and with [David
Kalnischkies](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/12/10/people-behind-debian-david-kalnischkies-an-apt-developer/), one of
the developers of APT, Debian's package management system. In the spirit
of these interviews, there has also been a [reverse
people behind Debian](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/12/04/go2linux-interviewed-me-the-biggest-problem-of-debian/) interview with [Raphaël Hertzog](http://www.go2linux.org/linux/2010/12/interview-debian-developer-rapha-l-hertzog-ubuntu-beneficial-debian-853).


Other news
----------


Luca Capello announced that the [annual
general meeting](https://lists.debian.org/87pqsb78np.fsf@gismo.pca.it) of [debian.ch](https://debian.ch/), the official representation of
the Debian project in Switzerland and in the Principality of Liechtenstein,
will take place on January 31 in Aareheim in the center of Bern.



Sjoerd Simons [asked for help](http://sjoerd.luon.net/posts/2010/12/pkg_pulseaudio_needs_you/) in [PulseAudio Debian packaging](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-pulseaudio/).




Richard Darst reported about the [successful first Debian-NYC Novice Night](http://debian-administration.org/users/rkd/weblog/12), which is a meeting for
everyone who would like to install or configure Debian for their own needs.
The next session will probably be [in January or February](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianNYC/NoviceNights); some [planning hints](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianNYC/NoviceNights/Planning) are also in place.




Alexander Wirt reported on his blog that [six
new mailing lists are now available on lists.debian.org](http://blog.snow-crash.org/2010/12/new-debian-mailinglists.html):



* [debian-gis](https://lists.debian.org/debian-gis)
* [debian-dug-in](https://lists.debian.org/debian-dug-in)
* [debian-user-tamil](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-tamil)
* [debian-l10n-vietnamese](https://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-vietnamese)
* [debian-l10n-indonesian](https://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-indonesian)
* [debian-stable-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-stable-announce)



Kumar Appaiah [noted](https://www.debian-administration.org/users/kumanna/weblog/13)
that [the Duck Duck Go search engine](https://duckduckgo.com/) has set up
some shortcuts (the so-called !bangs) for searching in various Debian sites:
!dpkg goes to [packages.debian.org](https://packages.debian.org/), !dpts
goes to [packages.qa.debian.org](https://packages.qa.debian.org), and
!dbugs goes to [bugs.debian.org](https://bugs.debian.org/).




Sandro Tosi mentioned on his blog that [bts-link
has a new home](http://sandrotosi.blogspot.com/2010/12/bts-link-has-new-home.html). Several weeks ago, in fact, [bts-link](https://bts-link.alioth.debian.org/) was migrated from
merkel.debian.org to busoni.debian.org.




Christian Perrier noticed that [German
and French localization reached 100% for po-debconf](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2010/12/21#german-french-100percent-squeeze).
Russian, Swedish, Portuguese, and Czech localization may also be able
to make it, while Spanish probably won't this time.




Stefano Zacchiroli collected various existing pieces of
documentation in order to answer the question [how
to contribute to Debian?](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2010/12/how_to_contribute_to_Debian/), and pointed to the [official contribution
page of the website](https://www.debian.org/intro/help), and its equivalent on the [wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/HelpDebian) and in the [FAQ](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/contributing).
He also highlighted less documented cultural aspects
of Debian technical life such as coordination over IRC
or interacting with package maintainers via the BTS.



Raphael Geissert [announced](https://lists.debian.org/201012161200.31008.geissert@debian.org)
the [Debian Automated Code
Analysis (DACA) project](https://qa.debian.org/daca/), which runs various source code quality
tools over all Debian source packages available.

 or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about
20 release-critical bugs remain to be solved for the
 release to happen.


There are also [more detailed
 statistics](http://blog.schmehl.info/Debian/rc-stats/#2011-02) as well as some [hints on how to
