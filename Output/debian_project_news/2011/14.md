Updated Debian: 6.0.3 and 5.0.9 released
----------------------------------------



The third [update for Debian 6.0 (codename
Squeeze)](https://www.debian.org/News/2011/20111008) and the ninth [update
for Debian 5.0 (codename Lenny)](https://www.debian.org/News/2011/20111001) have been released.
These updates mainly add corrections for security problems to the stable and
oldstable releases, along with some adjustments for serious problems.



DebConf12 official dates
------------------------



The DebConf team announced the [final and official dates for DebConf12](https://www.debian.org/News/2011/20111102):
DebCamp will be held from July 1 to 7 2012, followed by
DebConf from July 8 to 14, in Managua, Nicaragua.
DebConf will be preceded by a day during which the doors are opened
to the general public, commonly called Debian Day.
For further information, please visit the [DebConf12 web pages](https://debconf12.debconf.org/).



Debian Installer localisation
-----------------------------



Christian Perrier reported some [new progress](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2011/10/31#di-l10n-update-2011-5) in [Debian
Installer localisation](https://d-i.debian.org/l10n-stats/). Nineteen languages are now up to date for
D-I's core files; eight (Czech, Dutch, French, German, Persian,
Portuguese, Russian and Swedish) are 100% complete for the moment, and many
more should reach this hall of fame pretty soon, thanks to the translators.



Feedback after DebConf11
------------------------



After his [This week in Debian interview](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2011/14/#twid),
Adnan Hodzic wrote a summary of [DebConf11
and its consequences](http://foolcontrol.org/?p=1310).
He offers an inside view of DebConf organisation, sharing some of
the stresses and the amazing experiences he had with other organisers.
Among the after-effects: the Government of Republika Srpska may
seriously consider free and open source software for their own use,
and Adnan has taken a vacation to prepare himself for his next projects.



Uses of Emdebian
----------------



Continuing his [series on Emdebian](http://www.linux.codehelp.co.uk/serendipity/index.php?/archives/217-Documenting-Emdebian-intro.html), Neil Williams posted an article about [the use of Emdebian on special purpose computers](http://www.linux.codehelp.co.uk/serendipity/index.php?/archives/230-Uses-of-Emdebian-special-purpose-computers.html). The common
features of special purpose computers include: single task only, single-user support,
single mode input, restricted connectivity, constrained user data. On
this kind of computer Emdebian is very popular for many reasons, such as the
multi-tasking kernel and userspace which provide a responsive machine, or
the mere fact that in Emdebian (unlike proprietary competitors)
the graphical software is trivially separated from the core software.
But the most important reason is that Emdebian Grip allows better
debugging: in fact, Emdebian Grip is binary compatible with the
equivalent Debian suite and when a bug appears in the high level user
interface, it is much easier to debug that on the desktop than on the
device, said Neil.



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Stefano Zacchiroli reminded us that Wheezy is a
[few
months away from its freeze](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/06/msg00003.html): everyone can help.
He reported about some [discussions
that are worth attention](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/10/msg00001.html); about [maintainers'
and porters' responsibilities](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/08/msg00685.html); reasons not to use [private
email aliases](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2011/09/msg00062.html); etc.
Stefano gave updates about sprints (for coordinating which there is a new [mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-sprints/))
and the trademark policy.
He also recently attended the Linux Day in Parma, Italy,
and the Ubuntu Developer Summit in Orlando, Florida.



New Member process
------------------



Enrico Zini announced that the New Maintainer
process has changed its name, to become the [New
Member process](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/10/msg00004.html): the procedure is still the same, and even its initials
are unchanged, but its name is no longer confusing and ambiguous.
Thanks to Stefano Zacchiroli for his [proposal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-newmaint/2011/10/msg00028.html).
Jan Hauke Rahm also joined the New Member Front Desk, which can now be reached
at [nm@debian.org](mailto:nm@debian.org).



Further interviews
------------------


Since the last issue of the Debian Project News,
two new issues of the [This week in
 Debian podcast](https://wiki.debian.org/ThisWeekInDebian) have been published: with
[Jonathan
Nadeau](http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-28), who talks about the Ohio LinuxFest and his internship at the FSF; and with
[Adnan
Hodzic](http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-29-1), who talks about DebConf11.



Other news
----------
