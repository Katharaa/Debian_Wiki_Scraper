Updated Debian: 6.0.1 released
------------------------------



The first [update for Debian 6.0
(codename Squeeze)](https://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110319) has been released.
This update mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable release,
along with some adjustments for serious problems.



Nicaragua to host DebConf12
---------------------------


The DebConf committee has announced that DebConf12, the Debian
developer conference for 2012,
[will be held in Managua, Nicaragua](https://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110325).
The Managua bid beat a bid from Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
More details can be found on the [organizers' wiki](http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf12).


Debian Derivatives Exchange project launched
--------------------------------------------


Stefano Zacchiroli and Matt Zimmerman launched a new project called the
[Debian dErivatives eXchange project (DEX)](https://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110318).
The main goal of this project is to reduce the technical differences
between Debian and its derivatives. The first such group is the
[Ubuntu DEX Team](http://dex.alioth.debian.org/ubuntu/),
which aims to start integrating packages and changes available in
Ubuntu back into Debian. A gNewSense DEX Team is also expected soon.



The Debian Project invites all Debian based distributions and other projects to join the
DEX project and work together on a common base.


Bits from the Debian Installer Team
-----------------------------------


Otavio Salvador sent some [bits from the
Debian Installer Team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2011/03/msg00403.html), which summarizes changes that have happened in
the team since the release of Squeeze (such as the switch from Subversion to Git),
and the team's goals for Wheezy (among others, more features for netcfg:
wireless support for WPA networks, IPv6, VLAN network infrastructure
support, and link detection).
An important part of the mail is dedicated to a
call for help: the right moment to join the team and start contributing is
exactly now, as it's starting a new development cycle.


Insider summary of recent developments in DebConf11 organization
----------------------------------------------------------------


Vedran Omeragic has blogged about [some
recent developments in DebConf11 organization](http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf11/vo_insiderssummary.dc). The
[official DebConf11 website](https://debconf11.debconf.org/) has
been completed and contains a lot of information for those wanting to
attend this year's Debian developer conference. Another important step
was made (during a meeting held on 22 February) in establishing [sponsorship levels](https://debconf11.debconf.org/sponsorship.xhtml),
slightly changed from last year, and completing [sponsorship
brochures](https://debconf11.debconf.org/documentation.xhtml#localdoc), available in three different qualities. There are also some
clarifications about the Bosnian visa regime: all the information can be found on
[the related wiki
page](http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf11/Travel-Visa). At the end, Vedran lists the next steps: opening registration,
working on finding the best routes for attendees, looking for sponsors,
and preparing promotional material. You can contact the DebConf11
organizational team on their mailing list at [debconf11-localteam@lists.debconf.org](mailto:debconf11-localteam@lists.debconf.org).


Debian -offtopic mailing list
-----------------------------


Have you ever wanted to discuss things completely unrelated to Debian or even
computers with fellow users or developers? On debian-user the custom is
to put [OT] in the subject and fire away.


Unfortunately, this can be disruptive for uninterested subscribers,
especially on a high volume mailing list like debian-user. Because of
this, with the kind support of Holger Levsen and the [Debian Community
project](http://www.debian-community.org), the [d-community-offtopic
list](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/d-community-offtopic) has been created.


The list is open to anyone, just like most other Debian lists, so all
you have to do is to CC and set Reply-To to the list, so that whoever is
interested will know discussion is moving to that list. Have fun and be
excellent to each other!


Further This week in Debian interviews
--------------------------------------


Since the last issue of the Debian Project News, two
 new issues of the [This week in
 Debian podcast](https://wiki.debian.org/ThisWeekInDebian) have been published: with
[Joe
Shields](http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-22) of the Debian Mono team; and with [Jonathan
Nadeau](http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-23), about Debian and the Northeast GNU/Linux Fest.



Other news
----------


Michael Gilbert announced the [first
unofficial Debian monthly testing snapshot release](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg00347.html). The release is
currently available as mini ISO images for i386 and amd64 architectures.



Alexander Reichle-Schmehl noticed that the [video of the Linux New Media Award ceremony](http://blog.schmehl.info/Debian/events/cebit-2011/lnm-award-video-online), in which we can see Alexander
himself and Meike Reichle receive two awards on behalf of the Debian Project,
is finally [available online](http://www.techcast.com/events/cebit11/do11/).


As reported by Ana Guerrero in her mail, the [deadline
for proposing Google Summer of Code (GSoC) projects is close](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg00972.html). As
you may know Debian has again this year been accepted as a mentor
organization for the GSoC. The submission of student proposals opened
today, but we are still missing project proposals and mentors: you can
visit [last
year's projects page](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2010#SelectedProjects) to find some inspiration, or simply think of
an project in your team and propose it.


New Debian Contributors
-----------------------



Nine people have [started
 to maintain packages](https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/new-maintainers.cgi) since the previous issue of the Debian
 Project News. Please welcome
Vincent Cheng, Rodolfo García Peñas, Guillaume Mazoyer,
Fernando Mercês, Daniel Thomas, Christo Buschek,
