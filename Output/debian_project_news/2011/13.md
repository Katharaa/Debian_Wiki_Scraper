Debian's 18th birthday
----------------------



On August 16 [the
Debian Project turned 18](https://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110816): for that occasion, across the world there
were various [parties](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay2011)
organised by Debian Developers, Maintainers, Contributors and Users.
Pictures of these parties can be viewed at the [Debian Birthday website](http://thank-you.debian.net/), where
the project has collected 2230 thanks messages!
The Debian Project takes this opportunity to thank all its users and
contributors, and its upstream developers.
  

The Project has also received [some
birthday cakes](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2011/08/msg00023.html) from Polish users: thank you!



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Stefano Zacchiroli sent some Bits from the DPL, reporting his activities
for [July](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/08/msg00003.html)
and [August](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/09/msg00000.html).
The first mail includes some interesting news on trademarks: a
[potential
issue with the redistribution of GNOME](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2011/07/msg00031.html) (according to a
strict interpretation of the GNOME trademark) was [solved](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2011/07/msg00061.html)
partly during DebConf, with the help of Karen Sandler (Executive
Director of the GNOME foundation). With regard to the Debian
trademark, thanks to Jimmy Kaplowitz (SPI director) and Mishi
Choudhary (lawyer at SFLC) a survey of existing Debian-related
trademark was completed and the trademark on the name
DEBIAN was extended to the European Union, China and Japan.
  

In the second mail, Stefano writes about [the
services administration initiative, started by Enrico Zini](https://lists.debian.org/debian-services-admin/2011/08/msg00001.html), and
reports on his participation at the GNU Hackers Meeting.



Debian Bug Squashing Party at MIT
---------------------------------



Asheesh Laroia blogged about [the Bug
Squashing Party held at the MIT in Cambridge, USA](http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/sep-2011-bsp.html) on August 21.
The event was promoted by Geoffrey Thomas for MIT's student computing
group and went quite well: the attendees, some of them having
their first experience as Debian contributors, fixed several
release-critical bugs with the help of the present developers.
  

And speaking of bugs, Gregor Herrmann resumed work on the
[Release Critical
Bugs of the Week (RCBW) initiative](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/hacking/debian/rcbw/), launched in 2009 by Stefano
Zacchiroli, which consists of fixing one Release Critical bug per day.
Gregor, one of the most active developers in this initiative, observed
that in this phase of the development cycle there are plenty of RC bugs, [some of them really easy to fix](http://info.comodo.priv.at/blog/archives/2011/09/#e2011-09-11T23_26_22.txt). It's possible to use the [UDD bugs page](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi) to search in the
BTS for RC bugs.
If fixing bugs is too much for you, you can help triaging them, as
explained in the [useful
tutorial](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/09/16/how-to-triage-bugs-in-the-debian-bug-tracking-system/) blogged by Raphaël Hertzog.



Squeeze backports for Xorg
--------------------------



Cyril Brulebois announced [the
availability of X.Org Server backports for Squeeze](https://lists.debian.org/debian-backports/2011/08/msg00069.html). These backports are
particularly useful for people who need a newer driver, while users with
a perfectly working X could stay with its old version.
For those interested in the backported Xorg, a [documentation
page](http://x.debian.net/reference/squeeze-backports.html) is also available.



Debian feeds on Identi.ca and Twitter
-------------------------------------



In order to highlight the work done by Debian and to improve the
availability of such information, Sylvestre Ledru introduced [three new
feeds on identi.ca](https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2011/08/msg00034.html):


* [Debian new packages](http://identi.ca/debiannew/), which
shows the new packages submitted to the Debian Archive (also [available on Twitter](http://twitter.com/debiannew)).
* [Debian bugs](http://identi.ca/debianbug/), which provides
a feed of the new bugs (also [available on Twitter](http://twitter.com/debianbug)).
* [Debian removed packages](http://identi.ca/debianremove/),
which provides a feed of the removed packages in the archive (also
[available on Twitter](http://twitter.com/debianremove)).


Debian in Myanmar
-----------------



Theppitak Karoonboonyanan sent a [report
of his visit to Yangon](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2011/09/msg00014.html) where he delivered some talks and tutorials on
Debian packaging and mirroring. In particular, Theppitak has done the
preliminary actions to realise a Debian mirror in Myanmar; sadly, due to
Myanmar's internet policy, SSH connections between domestic and
international sites are prohibited, so only local people will be able to
maintain the mirror.
Another interesting initiative was the start of packaging of resources for Myanmar
languages support; in addition Thura Hlaing and Ngwe Tun started a
translation process for Myanmar in Debian and in GNOME.
He also reported that GNU/Linux is not popular in Myanmar due to
lack of internet access, which is mostly provided by internet
cafés rather than from homes.



Further interviews
------------------


There have been two People behind Debian interviews: with [Peter
Palfrader](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/08/18/people-behind-debian-peter-palfrader-debian-system-administrator/), Debian System Administrator; and with [Enrico
Zini](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/09/09/people-behind-debian-enrico-zini-member-of-the-new-maintainer-frontdesk/), member of the New Maintainer Frontdesk.


Other news
----------



Stefano Zacchiroli announced that [Colin
Watson has been appointed as the eighth member of the Debian
Technical Committee](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/08/msg00004.html). Congratulations, Colin!




Enrico Zini announced the [creation
of a new mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/08/msg00005.html): [debian-services-admin](https://lists.debian.org/debian-services-admin/),
aiming to create a single point of contact for issues with Debian
infrastructure services.
In addition, Enrico promoted a census of those services: you can consult
the first results of the census on the [related wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/Services).



Fernando C. Estrada announced [the
launch of the spam cleaning effort](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-spanish/2011/09/msg00123.html) on Spanish language lists. For
more information, you can visit the [relevant wiki
page](https://wiki.debian.org/I18n/SpanishSpamClean).




Niels Thykier sent some [bits
from the Lintian maintainers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/08/msg00002.html) in order to announce changes in Lintian
2.5.2. [Lintian](https://lintian.debian.org/) is a useful (and
widely used) tool for checking Debian packages in order to find bugs and
policy violations before upload to the Debian archive.
This new version includes several new features, including the ability
to process related packages together, support for
architecture-specific overrides, and test coverage of over 75% of tags.
