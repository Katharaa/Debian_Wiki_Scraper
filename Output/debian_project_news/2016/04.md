Internal News/Happenings
------------------------


**News on Debian Stretch**



Debian Stretch has
[entered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2016/11/msg00002.html)
its transition freeze. There will be no new library transitions or package
transitions that involve a large number of packages.




The Release Team maintains a [calendar](https://release.debian.org/release-calendar.ics)
with important dates. The next milestones are 5 December 2016 (forced 10-day
migration delay), 5 January 2017 (soft freeze, deadline for new source
packages or letting packages re-enter Stretch), and 5 February 2017
(full freeze for Stretch: all changes to Stretch will require
approval).




The Debian-Installer Stretch Alpha 8 release has been
[published](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2016/11/msg00006.html).
Tests and reports to find bugs and further improve the installer are welcome.
Installer CDs, other media and everything else are
[available for
download](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer).



The [softWaves](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianArt/Themes/softWaves)
theme, by Juliette Taka Belin, will be the default artwork for Debian 9.
It was selected out of twelve candidates using a survey. Read our
[blog post](https://bits.debian.org/2016/10/softwaves-will-be-the-default-theme-for-debian-9.html)
for more details about the process and how to help in getting artwork
packaged for Debian.



**New FAI version 5.2 is going to the cloud**



[The
release has been announced](https://lists.uni-koeln.de/pipermail/linux-fai/2016-October/011549.html) of FAI 5.2, the new version of the
Fully Automatic Installation tool set, which now supports creating
disk images for virtual machines.
It uses the normal FAI process and it's very fast - using a small set
of packages the image can be created in less than 50 seconds. A first
version of a Google Compute Engine configuration is also provided.



Events: Upcoming and Reports
----------------------------


**Upcoming events**


**Bug Squashing Parties**



On 4 December 2016 there will be a Bug Squashing Party in Dresden, Germany.
See the
[wiki
page](https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/2016/12/de/Dresden) for details.




There will be another BSP on the weekend of 27-29 January 2017
in Cambridge, UK.
More info on its [wiki
page](https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/2017/01/gb/Cambridge).



**Reproducible Builds sprint in December 2016 in Berlin**



There will be a
[Reproducible
Builds summit in Berlin](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/berlin2016/)
for three days on 13-15 December, with more than 50 attendees from 20
projects. The Debian participants will have a Reproducible Builds Sprint
during the event; details can be seen on the
[wiki
page](https://wiki.debian.org/Sprints/2016/ReproducibleBuildsSummit2016).




The main goals are to discuss and hack on reproducible builds in Stretch,
plus longer term plans for Debian 10 Buster, and, together with the
wider community at the summit, to improve collaboration both within and between
projects, expand the scope and reach, and brainstorm design
of tools enabling end-users to get the most benefits from reproducible builds.



**DebConf17 in Montreal**



The 18th annual DebConf will take place in Montreal, Canada, 6-12 August 2017.
It will be preceded by DebCamp, 31 July to 4 August, and Debian Day, 5 August.
The DebConf team welcomes any contribution towards its organisation,
particularly looking for sponsors.
See the [wiki](https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf17)
for more details on how you can help out, or have a look at the
[sponsorship
brochure (PDF)](https://media.debconf.org/dc17/fundraising/debconf17_sponsorship_brochure_en.pdf).



**Bid deadline for DebConf18 approaching**


The deadline for submitting bids to host DebConf18 is the end of December 2016,
so you still can consider hosting DebConf in your city.
Taipei (Taiwan) and Curitiba (Brazil) already have early plans and they
also welcome any help in the preparation of their bids. See all the details
on the
[DebConf wiki page](https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf18).



**Event Reports**


**Debian Day 2016 in Curitiba**



On Saturday 13 August 2016, the Curitiba Livre Group organised a
meeting at Centro UniversitÃ¡rio Uniandrade in Curitiba (Brazil) to
celebrate the twenty-third anniversary of the Debian Project.




Over the years from 2004 with Debian User Group ParanÃ¡ to this year with Curitiba
Livre Group, the free software community in Curitiba has organised
several activities to celebrate this date, with the goal of contributing to
the project and returning some contributions to Debian, such as code,
translations from English to Portuguese, and also help with finding new
contributors.




For more details about this event, photos and links, see
[Bits
from Debian Day 2016 in Curitiba - Brazil](http://softwarelivre.org/debianday2016-curitiba/noticias/bits-from-debian-day-2016-in-curitiba-brazil).



**MiniDebConf Cambridge 2016**



A mini-DebConf took place in Cambridge, UK on 10-13 November 2016.
Details of the event, schedule, and photos are on their
[wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/gb/2016/MiniDebConfCambridge). There were live video streams, and the recordings are
[already available](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2016/miniconf_cambridge16/).



**Debian Video Team sprint**



A [Debian
Video Team sprint](https://wiki.debian.org/Sprints/2016/DebConfVideoteamSprint20Nov2016) happened on 17-20 November in Paris, France.
The main goals of the sprint were to work on the software
video mixer Voctomix, streamline the streaming infrastructure, assess the
Opsis boards, write documentation, and agree on the new hardware that needs
to be purchased.



**DebianEdu sprint end of November 2016 in Oslo**


With the freeze coming, a DebianEdu gathering and sprint has been
held in Oslo, 25-27 November. See the
[wiki
page](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu/Gathering/2016-11-Oslo) for details.

Help needed
-----------


**Debian contributors survey**



All Debian contributors - from bug reporters to Debian project
members and participants in any Debian team - are invited to take part
in the first edition of the
[Debian contributors survey](http://debian.limequery.org/696747).
The deadline for participation is: 4 December 2016, at 23:59 UTC.
See more details in the
[call
for participation mail](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2016/11/msg00010.html).



**Help the switch to elpa-\* packages**



With the advent of GNU Emacs's native package manager, package.el,
there has been renewed interest in writing useful Emacs Lisp addons.
Unfortunately, both
[package.el
itself](https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2015/11/editor-malware.html) and
[the
infrastructure that has grown up around it](https://github.com/melpa/melpa/issues/2342) leave a lot to be
desired when it comes to quality assurance and security.




Over the past year or so the pkg-emacsen team have been developing
tools to convert package.el packages to Debian packages, and it is now
quite easy to create new ones. We'd like to see more Emacs users who
know at least the basics of creating Debian packages join our team.
To get started:



1. join #debian-emacs
2. apt-get install dh-make-elpa/experimental
3. man dh-make-elpa # to view a quick start guide


**Packages needing help**


[Currently](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2016/11/msg00133.html) [989 packages are orphaned](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/orphaned) and [153 packages are up for adoption](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/rfa): please visit the complete list of [packages which need your help](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/help_requested).


**Newcomer bugs**



Debian has a newcomer bug tag used to indicate bugs which are
suitable for new contributors to use as an entry point to working on
specific packages.




There are [185](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=newcomer)
newcomer bugs available.



More than just code
-------------------


**Contributors**



1,898 people and 19 teams are currently listed on the [Debian Contributors](https://contributors.debian.org/) page for 2016.




For the contributors getting their maintainer or developer account in
Debian, you can follow our
[bi-monthly welcome posts
in bits.debian.org](https://bits.debian.org/tag/project.html).

Daniel Pocock attended the first summit of the Free Software Foundation
Europe (FSFE), and sent a
[report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2016/09/msg00010.html)
