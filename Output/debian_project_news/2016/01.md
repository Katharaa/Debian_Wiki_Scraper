Debian Project News - February 18th, 2016
=========================================


Welcome to this year's first issue of DPN, the newsletter for the Debian community. Topics covered in this issue include:


* [Welcome to the New Debian Project News!](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2016/01/#newdpn)
* [Internal News/Happenings](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2016/01/#internal)
* [Help needed](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2016/01/#help)
* [More than just code](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2016/01/#namesuggestionneeded)
* [Reports](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2016/01/#reports)
* [Outside News](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2016/01/#outside)
* [Want to continue reading DPN?](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2016/01/#continuedpn)


Welcome to the New Debian Project News!
---------------------------------------


We hope that you have enjoyed our newly revised format of DPN. We have shifted
some of the content around, introduced new sections, and moved some content
onto the [Bits from Debian](https://bits.debian.org/) blog.


Bits from Debian will showcase new packages and interviews, plus some announcements,
and is where we will welcome new DDs.


We are planning to send more short news items via our social network account.
Please be sure to follow us on [identi.ca/debian](https://identi.ca/debian)
(or fall back to the non-official mirrors in other social networks).


One of the major changes is the removal of the DSA security advisories from
the newsletter. Debian's Security Team releases current advisories on a daily
basis ([Security Advisories 2016](https://www.debian.org/security/2016/)), so
please read them carefully and take the proper measures.


If you need to be kept up to date about security advisories released by the
Debian Security Team, please
subscribe to the [security mailing
list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) (and the separate [backports
list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-backports-announce/), [stable updates
list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-stable-announce/), and [long term
support security updates list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/)) for announcements.



We are simplifying and (we hope) improving the help needed section.
From now on, you will find:


* links to packages needing help,
* links to bug reports tagged newcomer,
* calls for help from teams in coordination with the Welcome Team,
tailored for first-time contributors.


Internal News/Happenings
------------------------


**Updated Debian 8: 8.3 released**


The third update of Debian 8 'jessie' was
[released](https://www.debian.org/News/2016/20160123) last month, addressing
security concerns in the stable release along with updates.


**Debtags cleaned up**


Enrico Zini [announced](http://www.enricozini.org/2016/debian/debtags-cleanup/) a
cleanup to debtags.debian.org. Changes were made to anonymous submissions,
the recognition of tags as official contributions, and mailing lists.


**Remembering Ian**



As we are all aware Debian mourned the loss of its founder Ian Murdock.
For the month of January most Debian services and outward-facing visual elements
kept with a darkened theme and ribbon in remembrance.
Slowly into this month we are changing the websites and services back
to their original themes and colours.




The Debian Publicity Team is preparing a website that will gather many
of the blogposts, messages, and contributions made by community members and the
wider free software mourning Ian, as well as the tribute video shown on 30 January 2016 in
the session [Ian
Murdock, in memoriam](https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/ian_murdock/) at FOSDEM (the Free, Open Source Developers European Meeting).
It will be announced soon in
[bits.debian.org](https://bits.debian.org), the Debian blog.




We thank you all for grieving with us and for all these contributions,
and we hope these gestures have been able to speak to the community.



**New Debian Pure Blends section in the website**



Iain R. Learmonth together with the different Blend Teams is updating and reorganising
the information about Debian Pure Blends in our website. Thanks!
We all hope you like this [new section about Pure Blends](https://www.debian.org/blends/),
which is also listed in the homepage menu of www.debian.org.



**Tails installer is now in Debian**


The Tails Installer is now in Debian, thanks to the
Debian Privacy Tools Maintainers Team.




The Amnesic Incognito Live System (Tails) is a live OS based on
Debian GNU/Linux which aims at preserving the user's privacy and
anonymity.




The previous process for getting started with Tails was very complex,
but now it can now be done simply by installing Tails Installer
in your existing Debian system, using sid, stretch or jessie-backports,
and plugging in a USB stick.




Read more about this news in
[this
article in the Debian blog](https://bits.debian.org/2016/02/tails-installer-in-debian.html).



**DSA and service maintainers encrypting all the things**



Let's Encrypt, the free, automated, and open Certificate Authority
went Public Beta in December 2015, and packages containing several utilities
to create and install these certificates have already entered Debian unstable and testing.
 



Let's Encrypt is now enabling the Debian System Administrators (DSA) team
to expand its deployment of encryption for debian.org services,
which started a few years ago with friendly help from Gandi.




Thanks to the DSA, we can now communicate with these Debian services using secure channels:
debtags.debian.org, metadata.ftp-master.debian.org, several syncproxies,
planet-search.debian.org, cgi.debian.org, www-master.debian.org,
search.debian.org, i18n.debian.org, and l10n.debian.org.




Thanks to their maintainers, these other Debian services are also secured:
codesearch.debian.net, sources.debian.net, lava.debian.net, jenkins.debian.net,
timeline.debian.net, dedup.debian.net, news.debian.net (static copy),
debaday.debian.net (static copy), plus several debconf.org sites.



And the work of deploying certificates is still ongoing!


**Miscellaneous**


Neil McGovern writes [On ZFS in Debian](http://blog.halon.org.uk/2016/01/on-zfs-in-debian/),
sharing his insight on the process
and discussion around compatible licensing in Debian.


**Upcoming Events**


* miniDebConf: Curitiba


The Brazilian community of users and Debian developers invites everyone to
participate in the [Mini-DebConf Curitiba 2016](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/br/2016/MiniDebconfCuritiba/TextoDPN)
that will be held on March 5–6 at Aldeia Coworking in Curitiba - Parana.


The Mini-DebConf is open to all comers, regardless of their level of knowledge about
or in Debian. Most importantly we want to gather the community to celebrate
the biggest Free Software project in the world, so we want to welcome users
of all levels from inexperienced to official Debian Developers.


The program will consist of basic and intermediate level lectures for those
participants who will have their first contact with Debian or want to know more
about certain subjects, and intermediate and advanced level workshops for Debian
users who want to get their hands dirty during the meeting.


The subscription to the Mini-DebConf 2016 Curitiba is completely free of
charge and can be made using the form available on the meeting website. Prior
registration is important for us to plan it according to the number of
participants.
* miniDebConf: Singapore


At [FOSSASIA](http://2016.fossasia.org/), Debian Singapore users
will make use of generously offered space to hold a [miniDebConf](https://wiki.debian.org/FOSSASIA/MiniDebConf2016) March
18–20 2016 at the Singapore Science Centre. Multiple events are already
planned including a Debian & Friends Meetup where new users and those interested
in Debian can gather, several talks and workshops, a bug squashing party, and
other events. With enough participation and attendees Debian may occupy a larger
space and may be able to hold a Sprint. This event is still in the [planning phases](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2016/02/msg00002.html) and open to volunteers and suggestions. There is a
community ticket of SGD35 which includes lunches and a T-shirt.


You can find more information about how to sponsor Debian-related events
and talks on the [events section](https://www.debian.org/events) of the Debian website.

Help needed
-----------


Packages needing help:


[Currently](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2016/02/msg00245.html) [710 packages are orphaned](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/orphaned) and [190 packages are up for adoption](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/rfa): please visit the complete list of [packages which need your help](https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/help_requested).


Newcomer bugs


Debian has a newcomer bug tag used to indicate bugs which are suitable for new
contributors to use as an entry point to working on specific packages.
There are [164](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=newcomer)
newcomer bugs available.
More than just code
-------------------


**Discussions**


While the world focused on the finding of gravitational waves, a savvy Daniel
Pocock noticed something else when he asked, [does
Debian help detect gravitational waves?](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2016/02/msg00021.html) Discussion brings to light
some of the efforts of several Debian teams focused on making Debian (and its Blends)
a better tool for researchers and scientific endeavours.


David Niklas asked a simple yet very serious question in debian-user that we
can all understand and possibly comment on when he asked,
[is this
keyboard worth $220?](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2016/02/msg00274.html)


**Tips and Tricks**


Matthieu Caneill wrote a quick and easy [one-liner
to open the source code](http://matthieu.io/blog/2015/08/16/one-liner-to-catch-em-all/) of any file on your Debian system; this marvel of
code was further modified by Orestis Loannou who tweaked it to use the
[debsources API to determine
a license](http://oioannou.com/2016/blog/one-liner/).


For the security minded, Petter Reinholdtsen shares a means of
[enabling
Tor to download Debian packages](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Always_download_Debian_packages_using_Tor___the_simple_recipe.html).


Reports
-------


Norbert Preining [writes](http://www.preining.info/blog/2016/01/10-years-tex-live-in-debian/) about 10 years of TeX Live in Debian with reflections on the history
of TeX, versions, and milestones of the process. As development continues
he gives the current state and plans for the future. 


**LTS status/updates**


[Squeeze-LTS](https://www.debian.org/News/2014/20140424) (Long Term
Support) for Debian 6.0 'squeeze' will end in February of 2016 (this month).
[LTS](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS) is handled by a growing community of volunteers, organisations, and
sponsors who work toward keeping a stable operating system in place with
support, security, and packages for an extended duration past new releases. LTS
for squeeze ran for 2 years. Look for an announcement soon from the LTS team
reporting on the end of support and the move to support Debian 7.0 'wheezy'.


Freexian reported on its sponsored Debian Long Term Support. December of 2015
detailed 113.5 work hours distributed to 9 paid contributors, the loss and
reduction of 2 sponsors and the addition of 1 new sponsor. Freexian is starting to
look to the future as LTS begins support for wheezy LTS which will include
packages that were excluded from squeeze LTS. Debian LTS is a critical area that
really needs help, support, and contributions; if you can assist or know of a
company that is willing to become a sponsor please reach out to the team.


* [Antoine
BeauprÃ©](https://anarc.at/blog/2016-01-05-free-software-activities-december-2015/) worked on future support for
[Redmine](https://tracker.debian.org/redmine) and a patch proposal to
ignore CVEs that affect unsupported software in the future.
* [Ben
Hutchings](https://www.decadent.org.uk/ben/blog/debian-lts-work-december-2015.html) worked on a
[linux-
2.6 security update](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2015/12/msg00002.html), backported several
security fixes for Linux-2.6.32-longterm, sudo, and claws-mail.
* [Chris
Lamb](https://chris-lamb.co.uk/posts/free-software-activities-in-december-2015) worked on libphp-phpmailer, foomatic-filters, and a cacti SQL
injection vulnerability as well as a new upstream release for [python-djano](https://tracker.qa.debian.org/python-django).
* [Guido
GÃ¼nther](http://honk.sigxcpu.org/con/Debian_Fun_in_December_2015.html) worked on the triaging of 16 CVEs and a fix for giflib. On his
own unpaid time he introduced some usertags for tracking non DLA items.
* [RaphaÃ«l
Hertzog](https://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/12/31/my-free-software-activities-in-december-2015/) uploaded MySQL 5.5 compatibility fixes for
phpmyadmin and postfix-policyd, updated the git repository for debian-security,
worked on dhcpd and arts CVEs, and worked the LTS frontdesk.
* [Santiago Ruano
RincÃ³n](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2016/01/msg00004.html) worked on gnutls26, grub2, and [MySQL-
5.5](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2015/12/msg00011.html) as well as frontdesk duties.
* [Scott
Kitterman](https://skitterman.wordpress.com/2016/01/09/debian-lts-work-december-2015-2/) worked on Quassel but was instead educated on Quassel in
attempting to resolve upstream code issues in squeeze and wheezy.
* [Thorsten
Alteholz](http://blog.alteholz.eu/2016/01/my-debian-activities-in-december-2015/) did frontdesk duties and worked on security updates for
bind9, libxml2, and libpng.
