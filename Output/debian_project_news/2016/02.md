 Debian's Security Team releases current advisories on a daily basis
([Security Advisories 2016](https://www.debian.org/security/2016/)). Please
read them carefully and subscribe to the [security mailing
 list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/).


 At the end of this project news we've added a **Quick Links** section which

Internal News/Happenings
------------------------



As of [February
2016](http://layer-acht.org/thinking/blog/20160219-debian-has-50k-binary-packages-in-main-sid/) there were more than 50,000 binary packages in sid main amd64!
With an increase to 51,000 as of [May 2016](https://piuparts.debian.org/sid/).



**The Great Freeze**


The Release Team has set the [freeze
dates for Debian 9 (stretch)](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2016/03/msg00000.html): 5 November 2016 for
transitions, 5 January 2017 for the soft freeze, and the full freeze on
5 February 2017. 


It is anticipated that stretch will be released with the 4.10 Linux kernel, and these
freeze dates allow for longer upstream support.


**Sixth alpha release of the installer for Debian 9 stretch**


The Debian Installer team [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2016/05/msg00004.html)
the sixth alpha release of the [installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer) for
Debian 9 stretch.


There are many improvements, such as Debian Pure Blends available in the
software selection screen, improvements in accessibility, Linux 4.5.0-2,
more hardware supported... Testing and feedback are welcome!


**All hail the DPL**


[Mehdi Dogguy](https://wiki.debian.org/MehdiDogguy) has been [elected](https://www.debian.org/vote/2016/vote_001) to the position of [Debian Project Leader](https://www.debian.org/devel/leader) (DPL).
Mehdi shared his ideas and [platform for nomination](https://www.debian.org/vote/2016/platforms/mehdi) as part of the voting process.


Off to an immediate start he gave an [interview](http://www.itwire.com/business-it-news/open-source/72513-debian-entering-fresh-territory-as-new-dpl-begins-his-term.html) to ITWire.com and posted his
first [Bits from the DPL](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2016/05/msg00003.html) report.


**Wheezy LTS security support initiated**


As of 25 April, nearly three years after the release of Debian 7
(wheezy), regular security support for wheezy came to an end. The Debian
Long Term Support (LTS) Team takes over [security support](https://www.debian.org/News/2016/20160425).
Wheezy LTS will be supported until 31 May 2018.


**Debian Java Team updates**


The Debian Java Team posted an [update](http://java.debian.net/blog/2016/05/whats-new-since-jessie.html)
of the current state of Java packages. 136 packages added, 63 removed, 213
upgraded, and 145 updated. They are maintaining 892 packages (+12.34%). OpenJDK
9 is available in experimental. New packaging tools have been created to work
with Gradle. Scala has been upgraded to the version 2.11.


**The Debian Japanese Translation team and The Debian Administrator's Handbook**


The Debian Japanese Translation team led by Ryuunosuke Ayanokouzi completed
an impressive body of work with
[the
Japanese translation](https://debian-handbook.info/2016/get-the-japanese-version-of-the-debian-administrators-handbook/) of The Debian
Administrator's Handbook. They also met the requirements to publish a Japanese
paperback version of the book, thus joining
[French
as the other available paperback](https://debian-handbook.info/2016/get-the-french-version-of-the-debian-administrators-handbook/). The
authors kindly donated copies of the Japanese paperback to several Japanese
communities to help them promote Debian and the book.



Ryuunosuke Ayanokouzi thanked everybody involved:



> 
> First of all, on behalf of the Japanese translation team, I would like to
> express our thanks to the authors, RaphaÃ«l Hertzog and Roland Mas, for giving
> freedom of translation. Then, I would like to acknowledge many
> important suggestions and comments about Japanese translation notably from the
> members of Debian JP Project's mailing lists (in particular,
> debian-doc@debian.or.jp) and Japanese Debian developers also.
> 
> 
> In addition, I appreciate the hard work made by Doru Patrascu on the
> Japanese-localized layout of the book cover.
> 
> 
> It would not have been possible to publish the Japanese paperback version of
> The Debian Administrator's Handbook without cross-cooperation between the
> authors, the translators, and the designer.
> 
> 
> Thank you very much for your great support!
> 
> 
> 


Other translations are completed and their translation teams are working
towards a paperback: Spanish, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese. Many more
translations
are in progress: Arabic, Norwegian, Chinese (Taiwan and Traditional), Russian,
German.
Don't hesitate to [contribute](https://debian-handbook.info/contribute/)!



**R.I.P. Iceweasel**


After nearly a ten year run, Mike Hommey [posted](https://glandium.org/blog/?p=3622) about the transition from
Iceweasel to Firefox in Debian.


**ZFS is now available in Debian**


Having
[ZFS
in the Debian archive](https://bits.debian.org/2016/05/what-does-it-mean-that-zfs-is-in-debian.html) was blocked for years due to licensing
incompatibility. However, through consultation with the
Software Freedom Law Center and the work of many patient Debian Developers we
are able to offer the ZFS in contrib rather than in main. The code is
available for users via DKMS.

**Event Reports**


Debian Ruby Team


In February the Debian Ruby Team held a [Sprint](http://softwarelivre.org/terceiro/blog/debian-ruby-sprint-2016-day-1)
at the Curitiba Federal Technological University of ParanÃ¡
(UTFPR). Eight participants over the course of five days were able to focus on working to
fix many of the bugs that occur between new versions of the Ruby interpreter.
The sprint was not all work as they were able to enjoy [cheese
and wine](http://softwarelivre.org/terceiro/blog/debian-ruby-sprint-2016-day-2-japanese-cuisine-bug-fixes-and-mini-cheesewine-party),
solve some confusion about Tinder, and work out how to improve sprints in the
future. 


The team completed over 151 uploads, worked on the transition to Ruby 2.3 in
unstable, and improved the toolchain in regard to Reproducible Builds. The team
documented progress each day and gave an excellent [final
report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-ruby/2016/03/msg00127.html) that links to the daily work. We look forward to their continued
work but more so to their solving the [One-Sided
Dinner Booth Problem](http://softwarelivre.org/terceiro/blog/debian-ruby-sprint-2016-day-3-ruby-2.3-in-unstable-reproducible-builds-and-data-structures-for-dinner-booths).


Mini-DebConf Curitiba 2016


The Mini-DebConf Curitiba 2016 had over two days dedicated to Debian with
20 hours of programming, 85 attendees, 12 lectures, 7 Lightning Talks and 5
Workshops. They wish to thank [Aldeia
Coworking](http://aldeiacoworking.com.br/) for space and contributions to the event, and shared
[photographs](http://softwarelivre.org/debianbrasil/blog/fotos-da-mini-debconf-curitiba-2016)
of the event.
