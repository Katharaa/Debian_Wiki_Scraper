Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Lucas Nussbaum sent his
[monthly
report of DPL activities for October 2013](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/11/msg00000.html). Among other things, Lucas
mentioned important ongoing discussions about the choice of default init
system for Debian (which has been
[brought to the technical committee](https://bugs.debian.org/727708))
and on the
[possible
use of CDNs](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/10/msg00029.html) to deliver content to Debian's users, as well as the
participation of Debian in the Outreach Program For Women.
In another message, he published
[the
schedule of the DPL helpers meetings](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/11/msg00035.html) for the next few weeks.



A new service to help in making Debian bootstrappable
-----------------------------------------------------



Johannes Schauer
[announced](http://blog.mister-muffin.de/2013/11/05/announcing-bootstrap.debian.net/)
the availability of a new service,
[bootstrap.debian.net](http://bootstrap.debian.net/), which presents
in a human readable way some useful information about source packages that need
changes to make Debian bootstrappable.
This information is gathered from the output of
[botch](https://gitorious.org/debian-bootstrap/botch),
a tool that can solve cyclic build dependencies using staged build information,
and then output an order in which packages must be built to end up
with the desired set of packages, thus making Debian bootstrappable in
an automatic way.



Mips64el porter box ready for use
---------------------------------



YunQiang Su
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/10/msg00704.html)
that after one year and a half of work, the mips64el port is in quite good shape
with more than 7600 packages built. YunQiang Su has received a new board which
is running the mips64el port, and is willing to give access to anyone needing to
port packages to this architecture.



Last days to donate to Debian Outreach Program for Women
--------------------------------------------------------



The matching program to help fund Debian participation in OPW will end on November 14.
There are just a few days left to make donations and help the program reach its funding target.
Brian Gupta [wrote an article](https://bits.debian.org/2013/11/opw-fundraising.html)
on Debian's blog describing the rules of the matching program.
Please consider [donating](https://debian.ch/opw2013) today!



Other news
----------



Charles Plessy
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/10/msg00006.html)
