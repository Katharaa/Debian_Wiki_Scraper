A summary of Debian GSoC 2013
-----------------------------



The [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/)
has now come to an end, and the 15 students working the whole summer on
improving Debian have sent in their final reports. They've worked on various subjects
such as
[ZFS
on Linux integration](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/soc-coordination/2013-September/001888.html),
[a
rewrite of the package tracking system](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/soc-coordination/2013-September/001884.html),
[improvements
to Debian search](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/soc-coordination/2013-September/001879.html),
[scan-building
the Debian archive](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/soc-coordination/2013-September/001881.html),
[a
MIPS N32/N64 port](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/soc-coordination/2013-September/001889.html), and
[a
redesign of metapackage creation for Debian Blends](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/soc-coordination/2013-September/001873.html).
The full list of Debian GSoC students and their projects can be found on
[the
Debian blog](https://bits.debian.org/2013/05/welcome-gsoc-students-2013.html).
The Debian project thanks the GSoC students for their amazing work and the Debian
mentors who followed them during these four months.
