Bits from Debian Med
--------------------



Andreas Tille sent some [bits
from the Debian Med team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/01/msg00004.html), reporting some recent
initiatives of the team, such as the [Mentoring of the Month](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMed/MoM)
efforts.
Andreas also announced that in February there will be a [real life meeting
of Debian Med developers and users](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMed/Meeting/Kiel2013), in Kiel (Germany); all interested
people are invited to join.



A look into the Linux kernel of Debian Wheezy
---------------------------------------------



Ben Hutchings, member of the Debian Kernel team and maintainer of the
3.2.y stable series at kernel.org, wrote a series of three blogposts ([part

[part

[part

be included in the Linux kernel to be shipped with the next Debian stable.
