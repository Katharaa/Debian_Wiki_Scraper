DebConf13 will have its DebCamp
-------------------------------



When the DebConf team
[announced
the official location and dates for DebConf13](http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf13/ma_dc13_venue_and_dates.dc), there was much uncertainty about whether
a DebCamp could be organised, for budget reasons.
The DebConf team has now [announced](http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf13/dr_dc13_debcamp_and_reconfirmation.dc)
that DebConf13 will have its DebCamp, which will last for almost a full week,
starting from August 6, at the main conference venue.




If you plan to go to DebConf13, you have until June 30 to
[reconfirm](http://lists.debconf.org/lurker/message/20130619.142526.7e2cb16b.en.html)
your attendance and thus validate your registration.



Debian Code Search on video
---------------------------



Debian Code Search is a search engine written by Michael Stapelberg
for source code distributed by Debian. It can be used from codesearch.debian.net.
Michael Stapelberg
[wrote
on his blog](https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg//2013/06/17/debian-code-search-talk.html) that the video of the talk he gave at GPN13 about Debian
Code Search is
[available](http://ftp.ccc.de/events/gpn/gpn13/gpn13-debian-code-search.mp4).
He explains the motivation behind this project and how the code works.
The talk is in German, but Michael created
[English subtitles](http://t.zekjur.net/gpn13-debian-code-search.srt), so that more people can enjoy the video.



Bits from the Debian System Administrators
------------------------------------------



Peter Palfrader sent a
[report
on the DSA team sprint](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/06/msg00164.html), which took place recently in LinuxHotel,
Essen, Germany.
During this meeting, Debian system administrators discussed among other
things the progress of the migration of services from physical to
virtual machines, the deployment of a Content Delivery Network for
static data served by webservers, the possibility of authenticating
alioth users via Debian's Single Sign-On server, and longer term goals
for configuration management.
They listed the points of contact for the DSA team and
their current guidelines.
The DSA team thanks the LinuxHotel and the Electrical & Computer
Engineering and Information Technology departments of the University of
British Columbia, who made this meeting possible.



Interviews
----------


Since the last issue of the Debian Project News,
 there have been two
[Debian Edu interviews](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/tags/intervju/)
with
[Jonathan Carter](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Edu_interview__Jonathan_Carter.html) and
[Victor NiÈu](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Edu_interview__Victor_Ni_u.html),
who both describe, among other things, how they got involved in Debian Edu and their views about it.




In an article about LLVM and ClangÂ 3.3, the French website LinuxFR.org
[interviewed
(in French)](https://linuxfr.org/news/llvm-3-3-et-clang-3-3#toc_20) Sylvestre Ledru about his work on LLVM and Clang in Debian.



Other news
----------



Julien Viard de Galbert
[wrote
a detailed tutorial](http://silicone.homelinux.org/2013/06/19/building-a-custom-debian-cd/) for building custom Debian installation CDs with
simple-cdd.




Ingo Juergensmann
[announced](http://blog.windfluechter.net/content/blog/2013/06/15/1634-debian-ports-mirror-builddnet)
that as a side effect of the Debian m68k port resurrection,
he decided to set up a mirror of debian-ports.org on
[buildd.net](http://mirror.buildd.net/debian-ports).




Steve Kemp
[presented](http://blog.steve.org.uk/debian_is_missing_a_tool__want_to_write_it_.html)
a quick hack to manipulate APT's sources.list. Others in the comments
proposed alternative solutions. You could use one of them to ensure
[there
