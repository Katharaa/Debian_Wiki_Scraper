Release date for Wheezy announced
---------------------------------



Neil McGovern, on behalf of the Release Team, announced
[that the
next stable version of Debian, Wheezy, will be released during the first weekend
of May (4/5 May)](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/04/msg00006.html).
Help with the final touches is welcome:
release notes, installation guides and documentation in
general, especially translations can always do with some work. Please
see previous mails on these, and help if you can, explained Neil.
And to show Debian your love, you can organise a
[Release Party in your city](https://wiki.debian.org/ReleasePartyWheezy).



First Qt 5 packages in experimental
-----------------------------------



Lisandro DamiÃ¡n Nicanor PÃ©rez Meyer announced that
[the
first Qt 5 packages have been accepted in the experimental suite](http://perezmeyer.blogspot.it/2013/04/on-road-to-qt-5-qt-5-base-tools.html).
For now they are available only for the 64-bit PC (amd64) architecture, but soon they will be
available in the 32-bit PC flavour as well. As for the ARM based ones, it will take a bit more time.
These packages have no GLES2 or Wayland support, but
non-official packages with GLES2/Wayland enabled will be provided at some point, for testing
purposes.
  

As for future plans, Lisandro said that other parts of Qt 5 are on the way. And remember,
these packages would not have been possible if it weren't for the great Debian's pkg-kde team.



Debian Edu Wheezy alpha release
-------------------------------



Debian Edu, also known as Skolelinux, made its first Wheezy based alpha
release on 26 April. It aims to provide an out-of-the box environment of a
completely configured school network, featuring:



* GOsaÂ² web interface for adding users and machines
* PXE-based network booting environment
* A complete collection of educational and office software
