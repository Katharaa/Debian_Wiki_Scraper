Debian 7.0 Wheezy released
--------------------------



27 months after the release of Debian 6.0 Squeeze, a new
stable version of the Debian operating system, Debian 7.0
Wheezy, [was released
on May 4, 2013](https://www.debian.org/News/2013/20130504). Among other improvements, this release
brings to its users [multiarch
support](https://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110726b), [various tools to
deploy private clouds](https://www.debian.org/News/2012/20120425), an improved installer supporting software
speech, which makes accessibility one of its strong points,
and an expanded set of multimedia codecs.
  

Adam D. Barratt, Release Team manager, has already announced a [first
point release planned for next month](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/05/msg00003.html) and given advice to maintainers about
further uploads to unstable: the development of Jessie is already
starting.   

Joerg Jaspert, Debian FTP master, gave some [insight into the
workflow needed by the FTP team to release a new stable version of Debian](http://blog.ganneff.de/blog/2013/05/wheezy-release.html),
while Raphael Geissert [noted](http://rgeissert.blogspot.com/2013/05/almost-one-million-requests-per-day.html)
that in the first 48 hours after its log files were rotated last Sunday, [http.debian.net](http://http.debian.net) handled almost 2 million
requests, for an average of 11 requests per second.   

Meanwhile, [Debian users and
enthusiasts from all over the world are organising parties](https://wiki.debian.org/ReleasePartyWheezy) to celebrate the
release of Wheezy: the [Catalan
Debian community](http://dunetna.probeta.net/doku.php/blog:debian_wheezy_party_barcelona) and [some
Indian Debian users](http://fossevangelist.blogspot.in/2013/05/releasepartywheezy-india-india-india.html) already seem to have had some fun! If you're going to
have a party, share your report and pics with us using the [identi.ca hashtag
#releaseparty](http://identi.ca/tag/releaseparty).



What's new in Debian Wheezy?
----------------------------



Michael Prokop launched the [#newinwheezy
initiative](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/04/msg00870.html) aimed at presenting to users and fellow developers the packages
that have been newly introduced in Wheezy. According to the Debian
contributors who joined the initiative, among the most interesting new packages
are: [various
forensic tools](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2013/04/29/the-newinwheezy-game-new-forensic-packages-in-debianwheezy/); [vcsh](http://richardhartmann.de/blog/posts/2013/04/29-newinwheezy/)
(manage config files in $HOME via fake bare git repositories);
[Charybdis](http://anarcat.koumbit.org/2013-05-01-new-debian-release-my-contributions-newinwheezy-game)
(a popular and solid IRC server which is the base of the software behind the
Freenode network); [packages
from the Grml system](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2013/05/02/the-newinwheezy-game-grml-packages-in-debianwheezy/); [mosh](http://noone.org/blog/English/Computer/Debian/New%2520SSH%2520stuff%2520in%2520Wheezy.html)
(a UDP based remote shell terminal which works better than SSH in case of
lag); [several
lightweight browsers (dillo, netsurf, surf and xxxterm)](http://noone.org/blog/English/Computer/Debian/New%2520web%2520browsers%2520in%2520Wheezy.html); [libghc-stm-dev,
a tool to help with writing non-buggy threaded programs](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/the_newinwheezy_game:_STM/); [scratch](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Wheezy_is_out___and_Debian_Edu___Skolelinux_should_soon_follow___newinwheezy.html)
(an easy, interactive, collaborative programming environment designed for
creation of interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art) and [plymouth](http://web.dodds.net/~vorlon/wiki/blog/Plymouth_is_not_a_bootsplash/)
(a boot-time I/O multiplexer).



DebConf11 and 12 videos
-----------------------



IRILL, sponsor of Debian for DebConf videos, has published all of the videos
from DebConf11 and 12. They are available both in MP4 (H.264) and
(recommended) Ogg formats, and easily available through their video player
([DebConf11: 56 videos](http://www.irill.org/videos/debconf-11/);
[DebConf12: 72 videos](http://www.irill.org/videos/debconf-12/)).



Debian beyond the cloud
-----------------------



Keith Chuvala, the manager of Space Operations Computing (SpOC) for NASA,
[announced this week](http://www.zdnet.com/to-the-space-station-and-beyond-with-linux-7000014958/) that the agency will switch to Debian on the International
Space Station's laptops. Specifically, the ISS astronauts will be
using computers running Debian 6. Chuvala mentioned they needed an operating
system that was stable and reliable, and that they will rely on the Linux
Foundation for training their astronauts and IT specialists.



Debian in Google Compute Engine
-------------------------------



Google recently announced the availability of Debian images on its
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
[Google Compute
Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine). At the moment, both 6.x and 7.x versions of Debian are distributed on
their infrastructure, in order to provide an easier workload migration.
For fast performance and to reduce bandwidth costs, Google is hosting a Debian
package mirror for use by Google Compute Engine Debian instances.
  

As Google announced, Debian will be the default image type for Compute Engine
from now on.



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Lucas Nussbaum sent his [first
monthly report of DPL activities](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/05/msg00002.html). Besides thanking the other candidates, the
voters and the previous project leader, Stefano Zacchiroli,
the newly elected Project Leader summarised his first thirteen days of activity.
Lucas focused particularly on the [ongoing
discussion about the Debian logo as a registered trademark](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/04/msg00082.html),
planned - with the help of Moray Allan - a survey of the main
Debian teams to verify their health status, and started work
on improving and documenting paths into the project.



Coding Freedom: a closer look at Debian contributors
----------------------------------------------------



Gabriella Coleman announced the recent publication of her book,
["Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics
of Hacking"](http://codingfreedom.com/), which was mostly inspired by Debian's community and active
members. The book strives to identify and explain the key factors that have
influenced the development of free software projects, while examining the
social impact they have had. A good portion was based on Debian, following two years
of ethnographic research. There is one chapter dedicated to the project and
many others draw on interviews with Debian developers.
  

The book is available under a Creative Commons license and freely
[available for download](http://codingfreedom.com/buy_download.html).
