Interviews
----------



Lucas Nussbaum, Debian Project Leader, gave an
[interview
to ITWire](http://www.itwire.com/business-it-news/open-source/60564-new-debian-leader-seeks-more-innovation-within-project) highlighting ways to boost innovation within the project.



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Lucas Nussbaum also sent his
[monthly
report of DPL activities for June 2013](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/07/msg00002.html).
Among other things, Lucas mentioned the current state of the NEW queue, where
[nearly 300Â packages are waiting](https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html).
The FTP team welcomed
[four
new members](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/07/msg00003.html) ten days ago to help them process the NEW packages, but they are
still [looking for help](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2012/18/#ftpteam).
He also mentioned that Debian is now part of the
[Network Time Foundation](http://networktimefoundation.org/).



Community distribution
----------------------



Debian topped a poll on the
[FOSS
Force blog](http://fossforce.com/2013/07/debian-tops-our-community-distro-poll/) asking readers to name a legitimate community
distribution. 255 people took part in the poll, and as multiple
choices were allowed a total of 855 votes were cast. Debian received
173 votes (20%), with Arch Linux (141 votes, 16%) and Linux Mint
(95 votes, 11%) behind it. Interestingly, the results were in line
with the opinions of the blog's editors about what it means to be a
community distribution.



New Debian Contributors
-----------------------



Five people have [started
 to maintain packages](https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/new-maintainers.cgi) since the previous issue of the Debian
 Project News. Please welcome

William Blough,
