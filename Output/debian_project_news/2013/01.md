wiki.debian.org security breach: global
passwords reset
-------------------------------------------------------



Steve McIntyre, administrator of the Debian wiki, announced that
due to a security breach,
[all
wiki.debian.org account passwords are being reset](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/01/msg00000.html).
In order to regain access to your wiki account, you'll need to
follow the
[password
recovery process](https://wiki.debian.org/FrontPage?action=recoverpass).
In the mail, Steve explained that the Debian Security Team recently
found a
[vulnerability](https://www.debian.org/security/2012/dsa-2593)
in the moin package which had been succesfully exploited for
wiki.debian.org.
The wiki has already been moved to another server and an audit of the old
server is ongoing.



Bits from the DPL

In addition, Stefano reported that the debian.eu domain is
finally under control of the Debian System Administrators.
