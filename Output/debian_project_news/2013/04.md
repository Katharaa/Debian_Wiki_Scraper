Debian Installer 7.0 RC1 released
---------------------------------



The first release candidate of the installer for Debian Wheezy was
[released on 17 February](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/News/2013/20130217).
Many fixes are included in this release of the installer, along with new
improvements, including
better speech synthesis support, various improvements for
GNU/kFreeBSD, fixes for the grub2 package, new supported hardware, etc.




A full list of known issues with details is collected on the
[errata](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/errata) page.
Everyone is encouraged to test the installer and report bugs;
media and further information are available on the [Debian Installer pages](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer).




This release was delayed a few weeks because of a
[technical
disagreement](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=699382#69) about one package.
Thanks to [prompt
action](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=699808) in response to the problem, a solution has now been
implemented.



700,000th bug reported
----------------------



Christian Perrier won the
[700,000th
bug contest](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2013/02/09#bug-700000-now), by betting more than two years ago on the date of
[bug #700000](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=700000),
which was recently reported by CÃ©dric Boutillier.
He now
[invites
everyone to participate](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/02/msg00002.html) in contests to predict the dates when Debian's
[800,000th and
1,000,000th bug reports will be filed](https://wiki.debian.org/800000thBugContest).



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Stefano Zacchiroli sent his
[monthly
report of DPL activities for January 2013](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/02/msg00003.html).
Stefano reminded readers that the election process for the next DPL term will start in early
March, so there are only a few days left to convince Debian developers to run.
He confirmed that he will not run again for another term.
Meanwhile he is also looking for help in organising Debian activities in
the Google Summer of Code program, and in maintaining an
[authoritative
list of DFSG-free licenses](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/01/msg00023.html).
Among other things, Stefano also mentioned an
[updated policy draft for Debian marks](https://www.debian.org/trademark).



Reports from FOSDEM
-------------------



During the first weekend of February, the Debian Project participated at
[FOSDEM 2013](https://fosdem.org/2013/) in Brussels, Belgium.
In addition to the official Debian booth, several project members
delivered talks about different topics: among others, Andreas Tille [presented
the Debian Med project](https://people.debian.org/~tille/talks/201302_fosdem_distro/index_en.html) ([video](http://video.fosdem.org/2013/crossdistro/Debian_Med___a_Debian_Pure_Blends_for_medical_care_and_microbiological_research.webm)),
Tollef Fog Heen and Michael Biebl gave an overview of [systemd in
Debian](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/debian_systemd/) ([video](http://video.fosdem.org/2013/crossdistro/systemd_in_Debian.webm)),
Samuel Thibault reported on [the
GNU/Hurd architecture in Debian](https://people.debian.org/~sthibault/hurd-i386/2013-02-02-fosdem.pdf), and Ian Campbell spoke about [the
future of paravirtualisation under Xen](http://xenbits.xen.org/people/ianc/talks/2013-02-fosdem-evolving-xen-paravirt.pdf).
Most of the FOSDEM talks are available as [video recordings](http://video.fosdem.org/2013/).



Update on Clang and Debian
--------------------------



Sylvestre Ledru posted an article on his blog about the results of
[rebuilding
the archive using Clang 3.2](http://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/sylvestre/2013/02/06/rebuild_of_debian_using_clang_3_2). To make the results more visible, Paul Wise has
[integrated
them into the Package Tracking System](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=699936).
In the meantime, Hideki Yamane has written a
[patch to
make it easier to use Clang instead of gcc when building with pbuilder](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=700290).
You can find more information about current efforts related to building Debian
with Clang and other alternative compilers in
[Sylvestre's
FOSDEM talk](http://mirror.geeksoc.org/fosdem/2013/crossdistro/Make_Debian_compiler_agnostic___Building_Debian_with_LLVM_Clang.webm).
