Debian GNU/Hurd release
-----------------------



The Debian GNU/Hurd team announced
[the release of Debian
GNU/Hurd 2013.](https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-news) This is not an official Debian release, but it is an official
Debian GNU/Hurd port release.
On the
[Debian Ports](http://ftp.debian-ports.org/debian-cd/hurd-i386/current/)
archive you can find the installation ISO images to download (netinst, CD or DVD), as
well as a pre-installed disk image which makes it even easier to try Debian GNU/Hurd.
Debian GNU/Hurd is currently available for the i386 architecture with more than
10,000 software packages available.
  

Please make sure to read the
[configuration information](https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-install),
the [FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.html), and the
[translator primer](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/documentation/translator_primer.html) to get a grasp of the great features of GNU/Hurd.



DebConf 13: Call for Papers
---------------------------



Debian
[invites submissions](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/05/msg00011.html) of proposals for papers, presentations, discussion
sessions and tutorials for its [DebConf13](https://debconf13.debconf.org/) conference which will take place in Le Camp, Vaumarcus,
Switzerland, in August.
  

Submissions are not limited to traditional talks: you could propose a
performance, art installation, debate, or anything else. Official
submissions will be accepted until 1 June 2013, 23:59 UTC.




DebConf talks will be broadcast live on the Internet where possible,
and videos of the talks will be published on the web along with the
presentation slides and papers. Regular sessions will be 45 minutes
long, including time for questions, with a 15 minute break between
events.



Debian Edu Wheezy second alpha release
--------------------------------------



[Debian Edu](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu), also known as
Skolelinux, made its second Wheezy based alpha release on 14 May.
Aiming to provide an out-of-the box environment of a completely
configured school network, this release features a number of software updates
and fixes, which are all documented in the
[release announcement](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Second_alpha_release_of_Debian_Edu___Skolelinux_based_on_Debian_Wheezy.html).




If you'd like to contribute to the project's development, please access the
[wiki page for new
Debian Edu contributors](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu/Contribute).



Bits from the piuparts maintainers
----------------------------------



Holger Levsen sent some [bits
from the piuparts maintainers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/05/msg00013.html).
piuparts is an automated tool aimed at testing for errors in the installation,
upgrading and removal of .deb packages.
In his mail, Holger reported that piuparts recently received a few infrastructure
upgrades, providing considerably improved speeds for the service.
  

The main improvement made was moving [piuparts.debian.org](https://piuparts.debian.org) away from the machine piatti.debian.org to the new
[cluster running
at Bytemark](https://bits.debian.org/2013/04/bytemark-donation.html).



Debian/Ubuntu Community Conference Italia 2013
----------------------------------------------



On 1-2 June 2013, the second edition of the Debian/Ubuntu Community Conference
Italia (DUCC-IT 2013) will take place in Fermo, Italy. The experience of
DUCC-IT 2013, which follows on from the first such event held in Perugia in 2010, is aimed
both at members of the two communities and at all Free Software
enthusiasts, offering an excellent opportunity to get in touch and learn more
about one another.
  

You can read the announcement (in Italian) and the full event schedule on
[the Italian community website](http://www.ubuntu-it.org/news/2013/05/21/comunicato-stampa-debianubuntu-community-conference-italia-2013).
