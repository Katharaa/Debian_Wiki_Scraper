Update for Debian 6.0: 6.0.7 released
-------------------------------------



The seventh [update for Debian 6.0
(codenamed Squeeze)](https://www.debian.org/News/2013/20130223) has been released. This update mainly adds
corrections of security problems to the stable release, along with some
adjustments for serious problems.



Call for projects and mentors for Debian GSoC 2013
--------------------------------------------------



Paul Tagliamonte, newly appointed [administrator
for Debian participation in the Google Summer of Code
program 2013](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/02/msg00006.html), asked all Debian contributors for [projects
and mentors](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/02/msg00007.html) to help Debian participate in the initiative this year.
Everyone (member of the Debian project or not, student or
not) is welcome to submit
their ideas, and to try and find people willing to mentor the
projects, explained Paul in his mail. Information on how to
submit proposals is available in the
[relevant wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2013).
You can also contact Paul and the other GSoC administrators for Debian on their
[mailing
list](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/soc-coordination) or on their IRC channel, #debian-soc on irc.debian.org.



Wheezy release progress
-----------------------



Niels Thykier, release team member, noticed that the
[current
pace of RC bug fixes
is slowing down](http://nthykier.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/wheezy-release-progress-february/), with only 1.1 RC bugs fixed a day since
[his
last report](http://nthykier.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/wheezy-release-progress-january/).
About 200 RC bugs are left to be fixed, and if the pace
of RC bug fixes does not pick up, the release team may
need to remove packages along with their reverse dependencies.



Debian at Open Source Conference 2013 Tokyo/Spring
--------------------------------------------------



Hideki Yamane reported about [Debian
participation at Open Source Conference 2013 Tokyo/Spring](http://henrich-on-debian.blogspot.com/2013/02/open-source-conference-2013-tokyospring.html) at Meisei
University, in Tokyo, Japan. Debian was present with a booth where Hideki
and other contributors talked with users and enthusiasts. Takahide Nojima
delivered a talk titled Debian Update focused on the latest Debian
achievements.



arm64 image available
---------------------



Wookey announced the
[availability
of the arm64 image](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/02/msg00413.html). This is the culmination of a
three year long effort to make Debian bootstrappable, which has been
used for the first time on the port to the 64-bit ARMv8
architecture. Whilst it should be considered alpha-grade for now, it
represents a great achievement: all these packages were cross-built on
raring, untangling cyclic dependencies with build profiles making this the first
(non x86) self-bootstrapped Debian port ever, explained Wookey.
Getting this port working has been interesting because it's
attempting four new things all at once: multiarch (file layouts and dependencies),
crossbuilding (tools and packaging support in a distro that historically
was always natively built), arm64 (aarch64) support in
packages that need it, and build-profiles to linearise the
build-order, he added.
The [current
status of the bootstrap](http://people.linaro.org/~wookey/buildd/raring-arm64/status-bootstrap.html) is online,
whilst more information on the port (and how to build
images) is available on the
[wiki page of the project](https://wiki.debian.org/Arm64Port).



Other news
----------



Paul Wise blogged about [a
QA tool](http://bonedaddy.net/pabs3/log/2013/02/23/inadequate-software/) for finding packages' inadequacies (broken symlinks, missing
copyright files, obsolete conffiles, etc.) called
[adequate](http://jwilk.net/software/adequate) and developed
by Jakub Wilk. People interested in software quality
are invited to participate in
[Debian's QA initiatives](https://wiki.debian.org/qa.debian.org).




Kurt Roeckx, Debian Project Secretary, [announced
the timetable for the DPL election](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/02/msg00084.html).




Hideki Yamane blogged about
[the
series of articles about Debian](http://henrich-on-debian.blogspot.com/2013/02/debian-hot-topics.html) he is writing for the Japanese
magazine Software Design.




Olivier Sallou sent a [report
from the Debian Med sprint](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/02/msg00082.html) held during the last weekend of February
in SchÃ¶nberg, Germany. The team worked mainly on packaging new software
as well as updating existing packages.

Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [Bugs Search interface of the Ultimate Debian Database](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi), the upcoming release, Debian Wheezy, is currently affected by 174 Release-Critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about 69 Release-Critical bugs remain to be solved for the release to happen.


There are also [more detailed statistics](http://richardhartmann.de/blog/posts/2013/03/01-Debian_Release_Critical_Bug_report_for_Week_09/) as well as some [hints on how to interpret](https://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats) these numbers.
