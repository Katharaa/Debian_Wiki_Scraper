Bits from the Release team
--------------------------



Niels Thykier [summarised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/11/msg00007.html) the release team sprint, in Paris on November 23-24.
Niels Thykier will join Adam D. Barratt as release manager for Jessie, replacing
Neil McGovern. Ivo De Decker becomes a release assistant, whereas Dann Frazier
is leaving his position as stable kernel liaison and Marc HE Brockschmidt,
Luk Claes and Steve Langasek are stepping down from their positions as release
wizards.
Concerns have been raised about some architectures, in particular ia64, which
is no longer considered as a blocker for testing migration.
The release team also agreed that it should be acceptable for most uploads to
unstable to be uploaded with medium urgency, to reduce the delay for testing
migrations.



A new member for the Technical Committee
----------------------------------------



In mid 2012, the [Technical Committee](https://www.debian.org/devel/tech-ctte),
the body in charge of making decisions on technical disputes in the Debian project,
took nominations from the project at large for a
possible new member. After private discussions, the Technical Committee
[decided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/11/msg00008.html)
to propose to the Debian Project Leader, Lucas Nussbaum, the nomination of
Keith Packard as a new member.
Lucas immediately
[confirmed
this appointment](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/11/msg00009.html). Keith will thus join Bdale Garbee, Russ Allbery, Don
Armstrong, Andreas Barth, Ian Jackson, Steve Langasek and
Colin Watson in the Technical Committee.
[I look forward to working
within the committee to further Debian's goals as
the universal operating system](http://keithp.com/blogs/Debian_TC/), Keith said.



Alioth is back
--------------



On November 10, the Debian server vasks suffered catastrophic disk
failure. This machine was hosting the storage for
[alioth.debian.org](https://alioth.debian.org/),
the Debian service running FusionForge and giving access to repositories of
many packaging teams.
After 10 days of intense work to recover the data and move the Alioth service
from a dual vasks/wagner setup to a new machine,
[moszumanska](https://db.debian.org/machines.cgi?host=moszumanska),
the Alioth admins
[announced
that the Alioth service is up again](https://lists.debian.org/debian-infrastructure-announce/2013/11/msg00002.html). Please update your known SSH keys, and
make sure your data is available on the new host.



Reports from November mini DebConfs
-----------------------------------



In mid-November, two mini DebConfs were organised: one in
[Wulai, Taiwan](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTaiwan/MiniDebConf2013),
the other in
[Cambridge, UK](https://debconf.org/wiki/Miniconf-UK/2013).




During November 9â11, 41Â people from
3 different countries (Taiwan, China, and Japan) gathered in
Wulai, Taiwan, sharing the experience of using Debian.
In this conference, participants had discussions and learned how to port Debian to
an sh4-based set-top box and various ARM dev platforms. Other topics involved
using Debian to develop something interesting: creating a quadrotor
helicopter, developing apps for Firefox OS on Debian, implementing
a browser in QML, Big Data, server deployment, etc.
Links to the videos and slides of the talks are available in the Schedule
section of the
[wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTaiwan/MiniDebConf2013).




The [mini
DebConf in Cambridge](http://blog.einval.com/2013/11/25#Cambridge-2013) welcomed roughly 60Â people
to the ARM offices from November 14 to 17.
It started off with two days of sprint time, set aside for focused
hacking. A selection of ARM development boards were available
for people to play with. The sprint sessions also saw some lively
discussions on a couple of topics: the status of the ARM ports in
Debian and automated system testing.
The last two days were more in the traditional style of
conference session. Two full days of talks covered a wide range of
topics: system testing to git tools, Debian ftp team work to
bootstrapping the new arm64 port, improving ways of tracking and
crediting Debian contributions to dealing with the new world of
UEFI.
You can find more details on the
[wiki page](https://debconf.org/wiki/Miniconf-UK/2013)
and videos of the talks are
[available](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2013/mini-debconf-cambridge/)
in various formats.



Bits from the Debian Med team
-----------------------------



Andreas Tille sent
[some
bits](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/11/msg00006.html)
from the [Debian Med team](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMed).
After mentioning talks he gave at conferences covering a variety of
topics to do with Debian
and open source software in the medical field, Andreas points out
an [interview
via Jabber with Rajeev Nair](https://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/debian-med/trunk/community/interview/interview_r.nair-a.tille.log?view=markup), the head of a
[health care journal](http://www.healthcafe.in). Discussion
centred on the contributions of Debian and open source software to the
health care industry, and how Debian is at the forefront.
This interview triggered the team to assemble an
[article](http://debian-med.alioth.debian.org/docs/debian-med-healthcafe.pdf)
targeting readers who are interested in Free Software in medicine but
don't necessarily have an informatics background.
Debian Med is now looking for ideas for where to publish this article.
The team was involved in several events, such as
[the Codefest of the
Bioinformatics foundation](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Codefest_2013) in Berlin, continuing Debian's contributions to
open source software in the medical field. The team is scheduling a
[sprint](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMed/Meeting/Aberdeen2014)
for February 2014 and invites people interested in developing packages helpful
in health care and bioinformatics.
