a new service](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2013/07/introducing_sources.debian.net/) for browsing and searching through all the source code
provided in Debian packages:
[sources.debian.net](http://sources.debian.net/).



Updating delegations
--------------------



Following his previous announcement about
[revocation
of obsolete delegations](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/06/msg00003.html), Lucas Nussbaum has updated the
[delegation
for the Policy Editors](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/06/msg00004.html), welcoming Jonathan Nieder to the team, and the

among them. More updates will follow.



Debian Trademark Team
---------------------



Lucas Nussbaum mentioned that Debian does now have a
[Trademark
Team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/06/msg00132.html). A more official announcement is still to come.
Besides answering trademark use requests,
the Trademark Team is currently working on getting the Debian logo registered,
and on clarifying the status of Debian-related domain names.



Architectures supported in Jessie
---------------------------------



During their previous
[sprint](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2013/13/#dsasprint), the Debian System
Administrators (DSA) set a
[list of
requirements](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2013/06/msg00606.html) they consider necessary to support a port for the next stable
release. They listed some specific concerns for the following architectures:
armel, armhf, hurd, mips, mipsel, sparc, and s390/x. Most of them are
currently being addressed, but porters may welcome help.
