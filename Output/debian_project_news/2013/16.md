Debian Women IRC meeting
------------------------



The Debian Women group
[held an
IRC meeting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-women/2013/09/msg00020.html) on September 7 on the topic of how to encourage women to get
involved in Debian. Projects were discussed for the next Outreach Program for
Women, but also smaller tasks and rewards for people that do not know how to
contribute. It was also proposed to hold local events, possibly with other
groups of women involved in FLOSS, and to restart IRC training sessions.
The meeting was well attended and discussions continued after the official end.
Margarita Manterola published
[minutes of
the meeting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-women/2013/09/msg00032.html).



Bits from the Release Team
--------------------------



Niels Thykier sent
[some
bits from the Release Team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/08/msg00006.html), containing
proposals to improve the Jessie development cycle: a change to the
testing migration rule, automated removals and automated metrics for
architecture qualification for Jessie.




In related news, Jonathan Wiltshire
[called
for release goals for Jessie](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/09/msg00001.html).
To propose a goal, [create
a wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals) before September 30 with a short description of the goal,
details of the advocate(s) and how the goal will be achieved.



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Lucas Nussbaum sent his
[monthly
report of DPL activities for August 2013](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/09/msg00002.html). Among other things, Lucas mentioned
the status of MariaDB in Debian and the fact that Debian was invited to
participate in the OpenZFS community.
He also summarised some actions taken as a consequence of the
[survey
of new contributors](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/08/msg00011.html), such as the creation of a package how-can-i-help,
and moves to encourage the asking of packaging questions on localised mailing lists.
He also mentioned that the next Outreach Program for Women will
start soon. If you are willing to be a coordinator for the Debian side, please contact
the [Debian Women mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-women/).



Videos of DebConf13 available
-----------------------------



Thanks to the amazing work of the DebConf Video Team, there are video recordings
[available
for download](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2013/debconf13/) of many sessions of
[DebConf13](https://debconf13.debconf.org/), which took
place in August, in Vaumarcus, Switzerland.
Sylvestre Ledru
[announced on
his blog](http://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/2013/08/19/video-of-debconf-13-available) that they can be viewed through a nice HTML5 interface
on the [IRILL website](http://www.irill.org/videos/debconf13).




Francesca Ciceri
[made
a start on providing English subtitles for some of these videos](http://lists.debconf.org/lurker/message/20130816.100346.cce380e6.en.html)
and getting them translated into various languages. Some are already
[available](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2013/debconf13/subtitles/)
online. If you would like to help with this initiative, have a look at the
[dedicated page on
the DebConf wiki](http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Videoteam/Subtitles).



If you enjoyed the work of the DebConf Video Team, you can leave a kind message on their
