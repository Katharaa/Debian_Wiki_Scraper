DebConf13 venue and dates
-------------------------



Moray Allan and Didier Raboud gave
[some
updates on the upcoming DebConf13](http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf13/ma_dc13_venue_and_dates.dc) to be held at
[Le Camp in Vaumarcus,
Switzerland](https://debconf13.debconf.org/map.xhtml).
In the blogpost, they confirmed that the conference will take place from
11 to 18 August. With regard to the DebCamp, during which usually the
various Debian teams meet to work on specific issues and projects,
the authors explained that it will probably be held the same week as the
conference: For budget reasons, current plans are to merge the two weeksâ activities
into an 8 day period. If you think thatâs a pity, itâs not too late to
change it â just join the fundraising team and start working
quickly!.
Registration will probably open around the start of March.




In related news, the DebConf team [sent
a call for bids](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/01/msg00006.html) for DebConf14. If you are interested in putting forward a bid for DebConf14,
send a message to their [mailing
list](mailto:debconf-team@lists.debconf.org). You are also invited to think about possible venues for DebConf15.
  

People interested in helping with the organisation of DebConf
are welcome to join the team, and find out how they can help by contacting them on their
[mailing list](mailto:debconf-team@lists.debconf.org) or on the
#debconf-team channel on irc.debian.org.



Automating Debian bootstrapping
-------------------------------



Johannes Schauer wrote a detailed report of the [status
of his Port bootstrap build-ordering tool](http://blog.mister-muffin.de/2013/01/25/bootstrappable-debian---new-milestone/), which was started as
a Debian GSoC project last year and aims to solve cyclic build
dependencies, making it possible to automate the bootstrapping of Debian on new
architectures.
Since November 2012 the project has reached some important milestones such as
providing a less "monolithic" toolset, a new dependency graph
definition, two new ways to break dependency cycles, and an adjustment of
the algorithm to allow a more precise final build order.



Interviews
----------


There has been
[an interview](https://fosdem.org/2013/interviews/2013-florian-weimer/)
with Florian Weimer of the Debian security team about his talk
"Trends in Open Source Security" at FOSDEM 2013.



Other news
----------


According to W3Techs,
[Debian
is the most popular Linux distribution for webservers](http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_details/os-linux). It currently has a
market share of 32.9% of all websites that use Linux, and growing.




Ben Hutchings published the [fourth
part](http://womble.decadent.org.uk/blog/whats-in-the-linux-kernel-for-debian-70-wheezy-part-4.html) of his What's in the Linux kernel for Debian 7.0 Wheezy
series.
Ben also asked for [help
in testing SAS drivers for the next point release of Debian stable](http://womble.decadent.org.uk/blog/call-for-testing-sas-driver-update-for-debian-60-squeeze.html).




Neil McGovern sent some [bits from the Release team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/01/msg00005.html) where he reported about the current status
of the freeze. Neil also asked for volunteers to help with the Release
Notes, and particularly for someone with kFreeBSD experience to create
the Release Notes for this port.




On the debian-project mailing list, an interesting discussion is underway
about [how
young people's experience of computers has changed over the years](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/01/msg00091.html) and
how this affects Debian, both in terms of contributors and users.
