their help, and the quality of the DebConf Team's investment, all the
conditions are gathered to make this event a success. Welcome to Curitiba,
every thing is ready, including the [official DebConf Cheese and Wine party](https://debconf19.debconf.org/about/cheese-and-wine-party/)!

**Newcomer bugs**



Debian has a newcomer bug tag, used to indicate bugs which are suitable for new
contributors to use as an entry point to working on specific packages.
There are currently [224](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=newcomer)
bugs available tagged newcomer.



More than just code
-------------------


Thomas Goirand [details](http://thomas.goirand.fr/blog/?p=311) the OpenStack-cluster-installer in Buster. The OCI
(OpenStack Cluster Installer) package sets up and provisions an OpenStack
cluster using a Debian live system image. The OCI process installs and configures
services and components as needed per server roles in the cluster.


Benjamin Mako Hill [shared](https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/new-research-on-how-anonymity-is-perceived-in-open-collaboration) Research on How Anonymity is Perceived in Open Collaboration.
The paper written by Benjamin, Nora McDonald, Rachel Greenstadt, and Andrea Forte
studies how open collaboration projects can balance the threats of bad behavior
with the goal of respecting contributorsâ expectations of privacy.


Lucas Nussbaum [introduced](https://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=960) his work on setting up a framework to graph
[Debian historical package trends](https://trends.debian.net/). Lucas delved further into the data with an
[analysis of package smells](https://trends.debian.net/#smells) (characteristics in source code which indicate deeper
issues or weaknesses in design).


Birger Schacht shared the steps used to [Install Debian with Encrypted Boot using
GRML](https://bisco.org/notes/installing-debian-with-encrypted-boot-using-grml/).
