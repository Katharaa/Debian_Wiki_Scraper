Debian Weekly News - February 13th, 2007
========================================


Welcome to this year's 3rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. In light of recent [attacks](http://it.slashdot.org/it/07/01/20/1936257.shtml) on SHA-1,
the [National Institute of Standards and
Technology](http://www.nist.gov/) is preparing for a [competition](http://www.full-disk-encryption.net/nist_hash.html) to
augment and revise the current Secure Hash Standard. Rick Lehrbaum [reported](http://www.desktoplinux.com/articles/AT8143350649.html)
that the installation of Debian etch on an old ThinkPad notebook went pretty
well and added a number of screenshots.


**Supporting Package Downgrade?** Justin Pryzby [listed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2007/01/msg00241.html)
a couple of reasons for not supporting package downgrades. They often work
nevertheless, except when package replacements and maintainer scripts are
involved. He wondered if there are any other reasons. Damyan Ivanov [recommended](https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2007/01/msg00253.html) the excellent documentation of [maintainer
scripts](https://wiki.debian.org/MaintainerScripts) written by Margarita Manterola on the [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org).


**LDAP and Infrastructure Updates.** Ryan Murray [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/12/msg00010.html) new fields in the Debian LDAP schema: Date of birth (developer-only
visible), Gender (world visible), and several fields to allow developers
to disable their @debian.org email address, specify a white-list, enable
greylisting and sender verification callouts or specify RBL and RHSBL to
be checked at SMTP time. JÃ¶rg Jaspert [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/12/msg00011.html) some important points about fields available via the mail gateway
and fields available only via the web interface. He also mentioned
how developers could help with `userdir-ldap`.


**FOSDEM Schedule finalised.** Wouter Verhelst [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2007/01/msg00029.html) the schedule for talks in the Debian [developers room](http://fosdem.org/2007/schedule/devroom/debian) at
the this years' [FOSDEM](https://www.debian.org/events/2007/0224-fosdem) taking place from
February, 24th to 25th in Brussels, Belgium. Debian developers will also
maintain a booth. Interested supporters should
contact Wouter Verhelst by [mail](mailto:wouter@debian.org).


**Debian powers New Zealand's Electoral Enrolment.**
Rodney Gedda Sydney [reported](http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/072965C09248DA04CC257268000C6C7F) that New Zealands [electronic election enrolment system](http://www.elections.org.nz/)
is powered by Debian GNU/Linux. The system consists of two clusters of
PostgreSQL databases in different locations that replace the former
system of decentralised Oracle databases with Visual Basic front-ends. The
new system also increases voting participation by automatically
informing eligible voters about ongoing votes.


**Restructuring Parts of the Debian Website.** Frans Pop [suggested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2007/01/msg00116.html)
to split the [overview](https://www.debian.org/devel/website/stats/) of
untranslated pages into three categories to help translators. Manoj Srivastava
[noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2007/02/msg00020.html)
that the navigation bar for [vote pages](https://www.debian.org/vote/) grows
longer and would like to create a history page. Martin Schulze [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2007/02/msg00023.html)
to alter the menu even more.


**Debian-Installer Release Candidate 2.** Frans Pop, leader of
the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer) team
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/01/msg00007.html) that the release candidate 2 of the debian-installer is
imminent. Nearly all [prerequisites](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/EtchRC2Prep)
for the last release candidate and probably final version of the [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) installer are met. This candidate
introduces Linux 2.6.18, incorporates translation updates and improves
the [graphical
installer](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/GUI).


**Debian GNU/Linux Support from Hewlett-Packard.**
Hewlett-Packard [announced](http://h71028.www7.hp.com/services/cache/442406-0-0-0-121.html) to support customers running Debian GNU/Linux on their
business line products ranging from HP t5725 Thin Clients to ProLiant
and BladeSystem file and application servers. Debian is also available
pre-installed and configured on several product series.


**Call for Project Leader Nominations.** Manoj Srivastava,
secretary of the Debian project, [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2007/02/msg00001.html) for nominations for the upcoming [Debian Project Leader](https://www.debian.org/devel/leader) election.
Prospective candidates are asked to send in their platforms and letters
of application to the project secretary in time, so they can be
published on the [voting page](https://www.debian.org/vote/2007/vote_001). The term of the new Debian Project Leader will start in
April 2007.


**Debian Live Autobuilder.** Daniel Baumann [announced](http://blog.daniel-baumann.ch/2007/02/05#20070205_debian-live-autobuild) that he has set-up an autobuilder for the [Debian Live](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/) system. This
is a live version of Debian GNU/Linux that doesn't need to be installed on a
hard disk. The system is available with different desktop environments like [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/), [KDE](http://www.kde.org/)
and [Xfce](http://www.xfce.org/).
Builds based on [testing](https://www.debian.org/releases/testing/) are
created every week and the ones based on [unstable](https://www.debian.org/releases/unstable/) are build daily.


**First Test Report on Multiarch DVDs.** Giuseppe Sacco [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/2007/01/msg00062.html) his
impressions about the use of multiarch DVDs. He wondered what should be done in
order to start the amd64 kernel instead of i386, Steve McIntyre [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/2007/01/msg00067.html)
that i386 is the default and prepending amd64- would do the trick. Giuseppe
also commented about a few documentation mistakes, Frans Pop [confirmed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/2007/01/msg00063.html)
that they are already fixed.


**Automatic Installation and Removal Tests.** Lucas
Nussbaum [sent](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2007/01/msg00038.html) in the results of [piuparts](https://packages.debian.org/piuparts) tests against the whole Debian archive. The first run only
tested the package installation process and the second run checked
installation and removal of packages. Lucas proposed to find common sense
before filling bugs with respect to the [log files](https://people.debian.org/~lucas/logs/2007/01/16/).
For easier processing Stefano Zacchiroli [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2007/01/msg00856.html)
for a list sorted by maintainer, which LoÃ¯c Minier [provided](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2007/01/msg00857.html).


**Archive Signing Key for 2007.** Javier FernÃ¡ndez-Sanguino
PeÃ±a [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/01/msg00386.html)
for the new archive signing key for 2007 which should be properly announced.
Anthony Towns [responded](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/01/msg00568.html) that a special Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 signing [key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/archive-key-4.0.asc) is used
instead and is expected to be valid until some time after the upcoming stable release.


**Updates for Debian Sarge.** Martin Zobel-Helas [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2007/02/msg00315.html)
the [preparations](https://release.debian.org/stable/3.1/3.1r5/)
done for the next stable update, 3.1r5. It will include updated versions for Glibc,
kernel 2.4 and 2.6, Mozilla, OpenOffice.org and XFree86 among others. Most of the
other packages which are updated incorporate the security corrections that have
accumulated.


**Debian Conference 2008 in Argentina.** Margarita Manterola [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/02/msg00012.html) that the annual Debian Conference for 2008 will take place in
the city of [Mar del
Plata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_del_Plata), Argentina. The conference will probably held during the second and
third week of August, 2008, which means that this will be the first DebConf
to take place in winter.
