Debian Weekly News - April 24th, 2007
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 5th issue of DWN, the newsletter for the
Debian community. Roland Mas [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/03/msg00011.html) that [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/) users can
use [Mercurial](https://packages.debian.org/mercurial) for version
control. Robert Millan [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2007/03/msg01168.html)
version 0.4.0 of the Debian [loader](http://goodbye-microsoft.com/)
for Windows operating systems including Vista. Joey Schulze [reported](http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200703292005) that [security](https://www.debian.org/security/) updates are available via IPv6 from
official servers as well. The new release of Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 is [celebrated](https://wiki.debian.org/ReleasePartyEtch) all over the
world.


**Saving Money with Debian GNU/Linux.** The leader of the IT
department of Germany's [Federal
Foreign Office](http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/), Rolf Schuster, [reported](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/85977/) that they
have seriously cut their IT costs by consequently using Free Software. Driven
by the urge to save money on license fees and to escape from update cycles the
office started the move in 2002 and has since then connected 230 embassies with
the secure intranet [gateways](http://www.bsi.bund.de/fachthem/sina/).
More than 300 laptops of diplomats also run a specialised distribution based
on Debian GNU/Linux.


**Debian participates in Google's Summer of Code.** Steve
McIntyre [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/03/msg00013.html) that the Debian project has been accepted for this year's Google
[Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/). During this
Google sponsors the creation and future development of Free
Software. A Wiki [page](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2007) has been set up to coordinate the participation and to collect ideas
and proposals for possible projects. The list of accepted student
applications was [published](http://code.google.com/) on April 9th.


**New GNU/kFreeBSD CD Image.** Aurelien Jarno [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/03/msg00401.html) that a new installation CD image is available for Debian
[GNU/kFreeBSD](https://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu/). This [port](https://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu/) is based upon the GNU C library
and the [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) kernel. The CD image uses
kernel version 6.2 which supports more recent hardware than previous
versions and is available for the [i386](https://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/install-cd/kfreebsd-i386/20070313/) and [amd64](https://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/install-cd/kfreebsd-amd64/20070313/) platforms.


**Sam Hocevar elected as Debian Project Leader.** Manoj Srivastava [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2007/04/msg00004.html)
Sam Hocevar as the winner of this years' [project leader election](https://www.debian.org/devel/leader) whose term starts on April 17th. A total of
482 developers casted their vote. The Debian project would like to wish
Sam all the best for his upcoming tasks and decisions. We also want to
thank Anthony Towns for his past term as Debian project leader.


**Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 updated.** Alexander Schmehl [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/debian-announce-2007/msg00001.html) that [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/), the
old stable distribution, has been updated for the sixth time to incorporate
security updates and minor corrections. With the release
of [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) as the new stable distribution
sarge has been moved to oldstable. Users who want to stick with sarge
have to take special care before upgrading to 3.1r6.


**Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 released.** The Debian project [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2007/20070408) the release of Debian
GNU/Linux 4.0, codenamed [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/). It
includes a new textual and graphical [installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) that supports 58
languages and encrypted partitions, packages and repository verification, and
a lot of new and updated [software
packages](https://wiki.debian.org/NewInEtch). It is strongly recommended to read the [release notes](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/releasenotes) before upgrading.
After nearly two years of development, this release marks another milestone in
the history of Debian.


**Interview with Ian Murdock.** Debian founder Ian Murdock was [interviewed](http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/murdockint.html) by
LinuxFormat. He said that he is happy how Debian has developed, but that it
is a pity that the project failed to release etch on time and how this
happened. Ian opposes the democratic structures in Debian because no leader
feels empowered to make decisions unless everyone agrees with him and
mentioned Ubuntu as a better example. In respect to the latter he expressed
his concern about compatibility with Debian.


**Debian Conference Reconfirmation.** JÃ¶rg Jaspert [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/04/msg00001.html) all potential attendants of this year's [Debian conference](https://debconf7.debconf.org/) to reconfirm their
participation until May 3rd. Only confirmed attendants are considered for
sponsored accommodation and food if asked for. Guests paying for everything
on their own are welcome as well, of course.


**From teTeX to TeX Live.** Frank KÃ¼ster [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/04/msg00006.html) that teTeX will be replaced with TeX Live. This is the successor
of teTeX and uses most of the scripts developed for teTeX. The old teTeX
packages will vanish and only continue to exist as transitional packages to
give users a sensible choice of TeX stuff.


**Debian 4.0 CD Usage.** Joey Hess [explained](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/tour_of_the_Debian_4.0_CDs/) that etch consists of 331 CD and DVD images in total but 324 of
them are only rarely needed. Of the remaining 7 images the most important one
is the [multi-architecture](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/multi-arch/iso-dvd/) DVD that boots on 32 and 64 bit x86 systems as well as
on powerpcs. It will detect the architecture and automatically boot the right
one. Enough software is included to install a nice desktop even without
network access.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
