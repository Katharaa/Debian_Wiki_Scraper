Debian Weekly News - March 13th, 2007
=====================================


Welcome to this year's 4th issue of DWN, the newsletter for the
Debian community. The Debian listmaster [determined](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2007/01/msg00046.html) as part of the spring cleaning effort several unused
and obsolete lists that will be closed down.
Tony Mobily [noted](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1772) that the last [GIF](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif) patent has finally expired. Gustavo Franco [reported](http://stratusandtheswirl.blogspot.com/2007/03/debian-get-life.html) that Second Life [runs](http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=197800179) on Debian servers because it is suited to scaling massively
with a small IT staff.


**Directory for Web Applications.** Paul Cager [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/01/msg00608.html)
what directory should be used as document root for a small web server he is
packaging. Luis Matos [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/01/msg00635.html)
that packages like [phpsysinfo](https://packages.debian.org/phpsysinfo) use `/usr/share/<packagename>` and symbolic
links to `/var/www/<packagename>`. Sean Finney [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/01/msg00641.html)
that the proper way to include web applications is via an alias in the web
server configuration and pointed to the [Webapps Policy
Manual](https://webapps-common.alioth.debian.org/draft/html/) written by the Debian Webapps Team.


**Release Status of the Motorola 680x0 Port.** Bill Allombert [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-68k/2007/02/msg00024.html)
that the last remaining showstopper for the [m68k](https://www.debian.org/ports/m68k/) port has been fixed since [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/)
contains [GCC](https://packages.debian.org/gcc-4.1) 4.1.1-21 for all
architectures. Stephen Marenka [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-68k/2007/02/msg00028.html) that
the inclusion may be considered when the number of [uninstallable
packages](https://release.debian.org/britney/testing_probs.html) in the testing distribution is as low as for other
architectures.


**Handling of inactive Debian Accounts.** JÃ¶rg Jaspert [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/02/msg00008.html) that the account managers will lock unused accounts based on the
ongoing [Debian Project Leader](https://www.debian.org/devel/leader) [election](https://www.debian.org/vote/2007/vote_001) and other sources
to measure developers activities and project participation. Depending on the
elapsed time the developer will have to go through a reduced [new maintainer](https://www.debian.org/devel/join/newmaint) process to reactivate
their account.


**One Laptop per Child Software on Debian.** The human [interface](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Human_Interface_Guidelines)
for the One Laptop per Child initiative is Free Software and can be [installed](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sugar_on_Debian) on Debian [unstable](https://www.debian.org/releases/unstable/). [sugar-jhbuild](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sugar_with_sugar-jhbuild)
provides one of the easiest ways to install Sugar. All packages required for
building are available in unstable and experimental.


**Google's Summer of Code 2007.** Anthony Towns [reported](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2007/02/msg00173.html)
that [Google](http://www.google.com/) is [running](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/02/speaking-of-summer.html) a [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) again
this year, seeking project applications until March 12th. Stefano Zacchiroli
[referred](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2007/02/msg00175.html) to the Wiki [page](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2007) coordinating Debian's participation which already lists several
tasks. Students will work on accepted projects from end of May to end of
August.


**Offline Key for stable Updates of Etch.** Goswin von
Brederlow [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/01/msg00593.html) if
the [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) release will be signed with an
offline key. Martin Zobel-Helas [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/01/msg00633.html)
that etch and every point release will be signed with both keys (online and
offline) and explained that the key is already created and Andreas Barth
is working to integrate it into [debian-archive-keyring](https://packages.debian.org/debian-archive-keyring).


**Better Internationalisation Support in Installer Manual.** Frans Pop
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2007/01/msg00942.html) support for translated entities in the [installation guide](https://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/) of the [Debian-Installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer),
using a [patch](https://bugs.debian.org/344048) proposed by Miroslav
Kure. Christian Perrier formerly [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2007/01/msg00431.html)
that the manual contained several custom entities that couldn't be translated
into other languages.


**Bharat Operating System Solutions GNU/Linux 1.0.** Chandan M C
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-custom/2007/01/msg00065.html) that the Indian distribution BOSS GNU/Linux 1.0 is based on
Debian GNU/Linux 4.0. It consists of a pleasing desktop environment coupled
with Indian languages support and packages relevant for use in the government.
The long-term goal is to localise the system into all 22 official Indian
languages to support people who don't understand English and are thus denied
Free Software's benefits. The [National
Resource Centre for Free/Open Source Software](http://www.nrcfoss.org.in/) chose Debian for its high
versatility and reliability as well as the guarantee to always remain
100 % Free Software.


**Binary Upload Restrictions.** James Troup
[explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/01/msg00760.html) that reproducibility and [logging](https://buildd.debian.org/) of automatic package builds together with build effort
coordination caused binary-only uploads to be denied for several architectures
and suites. Emulated or cross-compiled package builds are still considered
potentially harmful and are thus not encouraged. He added implementation details
and illustrated the events that lead to these restrictions.


**Closing unreproducible Bugs.** Julien Valroff
[wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2007/01/msg00565.html) when a maintainer may close an unreproducible [bug report](https://bugs.debian.org/396653). Neil Williams [added](https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2007/01/msg00568.html)
that it should be taken into account whether the submitter is responsive and
whether the bug report includes sufficient information. He asserted that the
`unreproducible` tag has a similar meaning as `moreinfo`, i.e. the report should
stay open, especially if it indicates a crash.


**Babelbox with Etch Support.** Frans Pop [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2007/02/msg00194.html) that he has updated [babelbox](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/BabelBox) to
support the upcoming [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch) release.
Babelbox is a set of scripts and tools to set up a machine that will
continuously run fully automated installations in different languages
using both the [graphical](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/GUI) and the [textual](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller) installer. Between each installation it will boot into the
installed system and log into GNOME for a short period of time.


**Debian Project Leader Election.** Manoj Srivastava [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2007/02/msg00185.html)
that [Wouter Verhelst](https://www.debian.org/vote/2007/platforms/wouter), [Aigars Mahinovs](https://www.debian.org/vote/2007/platforms/aigarius), [Gustavo Franco](https://www.debian.org/vote/2007/platforms/stratus), [Sam Hocevar](https://www.debian.org/vote/2007/platforms/sho), [Steve McIntyre](https://www.debian.org/vote/2007/platforms/93sam), [Raphael Hertzog](https://www.debian.org/vote/2007/platforms/hertzog), [Anthony Towns](https://www.debian.org/vote/2007/platforms/ajt) and [Simon Richter](https://www.debian.org/vote/2007/platforms/sjr) have nominated
themselves for the upcoming [Debian Project Leader](https://www.debian.org/devel/leader) [election](https://www.debian.org/vote/2007/vote_001). On February 25th, right
after the nomination phase, the campaigning phase begun during which
the candidates will answer questions regarding their plans and ideas. Sven
Luther who was also a project leader candidate [withdrew](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2007/03/msg00240.html)
his candidacy.


**French Debconf Translation of Debian completed.** Christian
Perrier [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/03/msg00068.html)
that Debian's Debconf templates in [unstable](https://www.debian.org/releases/unstable) are now
fully [translated](https://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/fr) into
the French language thanks to the continuous work of the French localisation
team and the whole [internationalisation](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/) community. A similar effort is also ongoing for
several [other languages](https://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/rank) with a
steady progress.
