Debian Weekly News - July 3rd, 2007
===================================


Welcome to this year's 6th issue of DWN, the newsletter for the
Debian community. Ulrich Hansen created a set of nice looking CD and DVD [covers](http://www.ulrich-hansen.de/etch/) for the just released
[Debian GNU/Linux 4.0](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/). Roland Mas [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/05/msg00001.html) that [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org/) has been
upgrade to [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/). Kurt Gramlich [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2007/06/msg00015.html) a Skolelinux Youngster Meeting on July 20th to 26th in Chemnitz,
Germany.


**Call for Papers for LVEE-2007.** Vlad Shakhov [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2007/04/msg00012.html) for papers and speakers for the upcoming [Linux Vacation/Eastern Europe](http://lvee.org.by/) (LVEE)
meeting. The event takes place from June, 14th to 17th near Hrodna,
Belarus. The conference goal is to provide open exchange of ideas and
experience between developers and users, give them ability to establish
personal contacts. Participants and speakers are asked to apply not
later than 1st of June.


**Interviews with Sam Hocevar.** The new Debian project [leader](https://www.debian.org/devel/leader) was interviewed by [itwire](http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/11654/1090/) and [linux.com](http://www.linux.com/feature/61671).
Sam expressed that he wants to focus on social aspects like improving the
internal communication, teamwork and motivating Ubuntu developers to
contribute to Debian. About the GPLv3 discussion he said that most GPLv2
software in Debian is already GPLv3 compatible and that using the GPLv3 in
Debian would cause even more license incompatibilities.


**Collection of Debian Art.** AndrÃ© Luiz Rodrigues Ferreira [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/05/msg00275.html)
the [Debian Art](http://www.debianart.org) website. It aims
to create an archive for high quality artwork like wallpaper,
splash screens, icons, logos, screenshots and system sounds
which can be freely used for KDE, GNOME, Xfce or t-shirts and
labels. This user contributed artwork can be included in upcoming Debian
releases.


**Removing PHP4.** Sean Finney [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/05/msg00126.html)
that PHP4 will be removed from [unstable](https://www.debian.org/releases/sid/)
and thus [testing](https://www.debian.org/releases/testing/). Sean has setup a Wiki [page](https://wiki.debian.org/PHP4Removal) to give detailed
information for packages depending on PHP4 and to track the progress.
He asked the respective maintainers to fix their packages to avoid mass
bug filing.


**Release Team Meeting Results.** Andreas Barth [summarised](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/06/msg00005.html) the release team meeting that took place in Jülich,
Germany. A review of the [etch](https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/) release
process lead to simplifying the use of release [goals](https://release.debian.org/lenny-goals.txt) for the upcoming
release of [lenny](https://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/). Architecture
qualification status notes are due to be published every two months and
release updates should be sent out more regularly. The report also contains a
rough release schedule which aims at the next release in the second half of
2008.


**Boosting the Release Team.** Luk Claes [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/06/msg00007.html) for new release assistants for the lenny release cycle in order to
distribute the workload better among them. Assistants need to have done
Quality Assurance for Debian already, have loads of spare time to use for
release work, have a good understanding of several scripting languages and
acknowledge that they will be doing merely basic work without authority over
the release.


**Serious Problem Reminder.** Lucas Nussbaum [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/06/msg01063.html)
that he's going to send mails to maintainers of packages with serious problems
once a month. When a release-critical bug is open for more than 30 days, or
when the package has not yet migrated into testing the maintainer will be
informed about the problems.


**FrOSCon Debian Sub-Conference.** Martin Zobel-Helas [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2007/06/msg00019.html)
for papers for a Debian sub-conference at this years' [FrOSCon](http://www.froscon.org/) that takes place on August 25th and
26th in St. Augustin, Germany. In addition to the developer room the project
will also [run](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2007/06/msg00006.html)
a booth in the exhibition area.


**Format String Vulnerabilities in Debian.** Karl Chen and
David Wagner presented an [analysis](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/fmtstr-plas07.pdf)
on format string vulnerabilities in the [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) distribution for the ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on [Programming Languages and Analysis
for Security](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/PLAS07/) that took place on June 14th in San Diego, U.S.A. Tools
have marked more than 1,500 packages potentially insecure of which 87 were
determined with true format string bugs.


**Backports for Debian Etch.** Alexander Wirt [announced](http://lists.backports.org/lurker-bpo/message/20070419.092600.5007052f.en.html) the availability of [backports](http://www.backports.org/) for etch. Backported packages should be available in the
testing distribution, contain new and important features and there has to be
user demand for them. Backports for [sarge](https://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/) are still supported and may need to be removed before the system is
upgraded to etch.


**Transition to GCC 4.2.** Martin Michlmayr [called](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/06/msg00008.html) for developers interested in helping with the transition to GCC 4.2
by uploading packages and inspecting build [failures](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=ftbfs-gcc-4.2;users=tbm@cyrius.com). Throughout the development of GCC 4.2, the entire Debian
archive has been recompiled regularly with development snapshots of GCC to
ensure a reliable compiler.


**Package Build Status.** Sergei Golovan [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/06/msg01266.html)
about the meaning of state uploaded. Goswin von Brederlow [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/07/msg00015.html)
that it means the [build daemon](https://www.debian.org/devel/buildd/) has
received a signed changes file and has uploaded the package into the incoming
queue. When this status does not change for a while something went wrong.
The buildd admin has to upload the package again or return it for a
rebuild.


**Security Updates.** You know the drill. Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.
