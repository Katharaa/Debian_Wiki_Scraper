Debian Weekly News - April 6th, 1999
====================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian
developer community. It's a day late and a bit short this week due
to the editor's vacation.





**The logo team has chosen 4 candidates for our new logo.**
Wichert has made a [web
page](https://www.debian.org/~wakkerma/logos/) displaying 4 excellent new logos and our current logo.
You can also read Wichert's [commentary](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/14/mail#mail1) on each logo,
which begins the one week discussion period before voting begins.
At the same time, Wichert has [proposed](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/14/mail#mail2) a vote on
whether we should have a single logo or an official and a
liberal use logo.




**Neal Stephenson**, award winning author of Snow Crash and other cyberpunk
science fiction turns out to be a user and fan of Debian. He's written an
[article](http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html) on
operating systems in which he enthuses about Debian and specifically about
the bug tracking system. "I use a distribution called Debian [...] what
really sold me on it was its phenomenal bug database"




**What's the buggiest package in Debian?** It's easy to find out using RaphaÃ«l
Hertzog's [pages](http://master.debian.org/~hertzog/qa/) which
[score packages](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-9903/msg00106.html) based on different criteria, including number of bugs, number
of lintian errors, and ages of bugs.
Also, the pages listing critical bug reports are back online, at a
[new
location](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg00105.html).




A 12 page "review of Debian 2.1 as a platform for econometric
research" has been
[written](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9903/msg02726.html) by James MacKinnon, an economics professor.




**No new packages were added to Debian this week**, though several are
waiting in Incoming. There are some important updates to existing packages
though:



* **On the security front**, a [new procmail](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/14/mail#mail3) is
out that fixes some buffer overflows.
* **An official test build of XFree86 3.3.3.1** is
[available](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg00182.html) at last. Note that versions of X in Debian are
[not vulnerable](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/14/mail#mail4) to /tmp symlink race security holes that
have been reported on bugtraq.



**Corrections** to last week's news:



* The sgml press release mentioned last week was in fact released right as
last week's Debian Weekly News went to press.
