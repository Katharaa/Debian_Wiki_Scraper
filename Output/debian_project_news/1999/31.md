Debian Weekly News - August 17th, 1999
======================================



**Welcome** to the 31st issue of Debian Weekly News, a newsletter
for the Debian developer community.





**LinuxWorld Expo** was the big event of the week. **Debian received
a Visitors' Choice award** for Best Client Distribution. Debian was also
a finalist in the Editors' Choice awards for Best Web Server, Best Mail
Server and overall Best Server Distribution.
**Expo pictures are also
[available](https://www.debian.org/~joeyh/linuxworld2/)**




Also at LinuxWorld Expo, **Corel demonstrated their Corel Linux Distribution, based
on Debian**. It includes a graphical 4 question install process, and also
has an apt frontend that uses QT, which can be seen
[here](http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/linuxworldtoday/lwt-news2.html). Many people have **criticized Debian for being difficult to
install**. Christopher W. Curtis started a
[discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg00847.html)
on how the Corel Debian installer can make things easier for the new user.




**A warning to people upgrading from slink to potato**: a dependency
problem was
[discovered](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg00611.html)
in the bash package that would **cause bash to be removed** from your
system when you upgrade. A fixed bash package has already been
[uploaded](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg00774.html).




Joey Hess [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg00604.html) a **major update to slink (Debian 2.1)**. Under the proposal,
major packages that have been tested for 2-4 months will be incorporated into
slink. Hopefully, this experiment will help cut down on Debian's future
release cycles. Response so far as been largely positive, and work is
underway.




**Freeze watch:** the latest
[BugScan
report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9908/msg00010.html) from Wichert Akkerman shows **208 release-critical
bugs** in potato. Several developers have carefully gone through
the report and identified possible solutions for many of the bugs. A
bug-squatter team is needed to fix remaining release critical bugs
after the freeze. Please [contact our
release manager](mailto:dark@xs4all.nl) if you are willing to volunteer.




As usual, a summary of news from the Debian-JP project is
[available](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/31/mail#mail1).
