Debian Weekly News - June 29th, 1999
====================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.





**A new Debian Book has been
[published](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg01823.html).** Titled Debian GNU/Linux: Guide to Installation and
Usage, it is authored by developers John Goerzen and Ossama Othman and
should get a wide distribution in many bookstores. It includes a CD, some
profits go to the FSF, and best of all, the **entire book is GPL'd** (and
will soon be packaged)!





**It's time to vote on the logo again.** This time, the vote is a
question of swapping the official and liberal use logos. Here's the
[Call For
Votes](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-9906/msg00163.html) and here's a
[ballot](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9906/msg00012.html). This went to vote quickly and is the third vote related to the
logo, and there has been a bit of a reaction against that. As Philip Hands
[says](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-9906/msg00193.html),
"Decision making in Debian has always previously been based on consensus,
even if the consensus was simply “We should vote on it”". This may point
to a flaw in the Debian constitution, since "Every vote so far has been
conducted under the constitution".




**In security news, a new version of mailman** is
[available](https://www.debian.org/security/1999/19990623)
fixing a security hole that allowed access to list administration webpages
without knowing the proper password.




Manoj Srivastava has put together a
[draft](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?https://www.debian.org/%7Esrivasta/policy.text.gz) of
Debian policy 3.0.0.0. As the version number indicates, this is a major
revision, representing a lot of work and discussion in debian-policy over
the past few months. The two major changes are that **policy now mandates
FHS compliance**, and that **logrotate is now Debian's preferred log
rotation tool**. Other changes include merging the packaging manual into
the same source package, clarification on the use of the Standards-Version
tag, a recommendation that libtool \*.la files be included in -dev packages,
and the inclusion of the menu hierarchy in the policy package. All these
changes are summarized by Manoj [here](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/25/mail#mail1).




**The topic of niced cron jobs has come up again.** It looks like both
anacron and cron will soon default to nicing the jobs they run. The thread did
generate [one valid objection](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg01728.html) this time around -- niced cron jobs can lead to resource
starvation on very heavily loaded machines.




**YASDI (Yet Another Simple Debian Installation)** was announced at the
Europe-Japan Conference on Linux and Free Software. According
to the speaker writeup, YASDI allows one to automatically generate
customized distributions based on Debian and can be thought of as
a meta-distribution or meta-installer. Slides are available
[here](http://www.europe-inside.com/eurojapan/slides/yasdi/).




**A debian-sgml mailing ist list** has been
[created](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg01540.html), for discussion of SGML and XML in Debian.




Stephane Bortzmeyer has
[written](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9906/msg00429.html) a draft **policy for java compilers and virtual machines in
Debian**.

**The LinuxTag convention** was last weekend in Germany, here's a [report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg02065.html)
of Debian related activities there.




**Server news**:



* Debian developers now have access to
[two
Alphas](https://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha-9906/msg00223.html) (Faure, Albert)
and [a
Sparc](https://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha-9906/msg00228.html) (Kubrick). The accounts on these machines are now synchronized
with master using LDAP.



**Followups** to last week's items:



* **The thread about moving contrib and non-free** to their own server has
predictably grown a lot this week as many people post their thoughts on the
idea. A [subthread](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg01550.html) asks why contrib should be moved along with non-free. It's also
worth reading Jason Gunthorpe's
[message](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-9906/msg00142.html)
about how this would really affect our mirrors and
[RMS's
reaction](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-9906/msg00105.html) to the proposal: "Hear, hear!".



Thanks to Mike Linksvayer, Christian Meder, and Katsura S. Yoshio for
