Debian Weekly News - November 23rd, 1999
========================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.




Adam Di Carlo
[reports](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9911/msg01236.html)
on the **status of the boot floppies**: "*we've mostly completed shoring
up the internals of boot-floppies*". With the internals cleaned up, the
boot-floppies team is ready to work on bugs and todo list items. Adam also
says that "*all the major tasks are assigned, and to capable people*"
and that the work on the boot floppies is on track to be "*feature complete
in early December*". The best way to help with the boot floppies now is to
help the team
[work
through](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9911/msg01237.html) their [bug list](https://bugs.debian.org/boot-floppies),
and to help
[test the
base system](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-9911/msg00632.html) installed by the boot floppies. This last can be accomplished
easily by unpacking a tarball and chrooting; no need to reinstall. These are
tasks anyone with even a few hours can help with, and getting a working
boot-floppies is the critical item that needs to be accomplished before our
next release.





**Debian with the FreeBSD kernel** was the subject of a heated week-long
discussion. It seems that since this idea was first
[conceived](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/8/#freebsd) in February, a few people have been
working on the port. The status of their work can be read about
[here](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9911/msg01372.html).
Basically, they are using the FreeBSD kernel and libc, and recompiling Debian
packages to work on that system. **Reactions varied.** John Goerzen
[worries](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9911/msg01373.html)
that a version of Debian based on a BSD copyrighted kernel would open the door
to third parties taking our work and making it proprietary, and also that
"*we are essentially giving first aid to software that is dying (and
rightfully so) because of its license*". Many others disagree with him and
have no problems with the BSD license. Others
[wonder](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-9911/msg00087.html)
if it wouldn't be technically better, and easier in the long run, to port
glibc to FreeBSD, and allow Debian packages to be used unchanged with that
kernel and library combination.




**Guy Maor takes on the package pool.** Guy
[described](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9911/msg01522.html)
a variant of the package pool idea, and said he would implement it. This will
be a major restructuring of the Debian archive, and it will add a great deal
of flexibility: "*creating a new distribution requires writing code which
answers the question, given the available versions of this package, which
one to choose?*" The downside is that "*mirroring by architecture and
by freeness is still possible, but mirroring by distribution is not possible
without a specialized tool.*" Response to Guy's posting was enthusiastic;
maybe the package pool idea will finally become reality.
