Debian Weekly News - November 9th, 1999
=======================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.





**Bad news: the freeze has been pushed back all the way to mid-January.**
The main problem is the boot floppies, which probably
[won't be ready](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/43/mail#mail2) until then. Read Richard Braakman's
[mail](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9911/msg00006.html)
for his other reasons for delaying the freeze. According to Richard, the best
way to help with the release at this point is to work on the boot floppies.
The second best thing people can do to help is to avoid making any
major changes to unstable, even though it's not formally frozen -- "*don't
start anything that you can't finish*" before the new freeze date.




**Few people are happy with this postponement of the freeze**, and lots of
ideas have been floated, including the idea of having a
[partial freeze](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/43/mail#mail3). One idea that has gathered lots of
support is Joey Hess'
[stable
update proposal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9911/msg00577.html). Some kind of update needs to be made before next year,
since stable has a few [known Y2K problems](https://www.debian.org/y2k/extra).
Vincent Renardias, Release Manager for stable, is looking at doing an update
to slink specifically to
[fix the
y2k issues](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9911/msg00419.html).





**A new version of policy** has been
[released](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9911/msg00048.html),
and it potentially affects every package in Debian. The major changes are a
final word on the /usr/share/doc issue, and the introduction of build
dependencies. Other changes include FHS 2.1 (reverts /var/state to /var/lib),
the deprecation of /etc/rc.boot, a MIME subpolicy, mailbox locking updates, and
the conversion of HTML changelogs to plain text format.




**Another package becomes free:** OpenSSH has
[replaced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9911/msg00167.html)
the non-free version of ssh in Debian. There are a few
[known
problems](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9911/msg00219.html) with OpenSSH, so those who need a stable ssh might want to
install the ssh-nonfree package for now.





**The size of Incoming** has been a common concern this week, with many
people [worrying](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9911/msg00472.html) about what happens to packages that are still stuck there when we
freeze. Incoming peaked at around 800 MB last week, though thanks to the hard
work of the ftp admins, it is now about 250 MB and has only 70 .changes files
in it. Since [two new members](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/43/mail#mail4) have just been added to the
archive maintenance team, now five strong, with any luck this problem won't
resurface when we finally do freeze.




**Pictures of Ian Murdock**, founder of Debian, are
[available](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://perens.com/Photos/IanMurdockParty/)
after a recent Debian get-together in Berkeley.




**A quick look at other things going on this week:**



* Randolph Chung is
[starting
work](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-9911/msg00127.html) on a task selection GUI.
* Netstd was
[broken
up](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9911/msg00463.html) into several smaller packages, which is causing unanticipated problems.
* October GNOME has been [backported to slink](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/43/mail#mail1).
