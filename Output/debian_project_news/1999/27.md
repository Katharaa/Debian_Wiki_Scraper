Debian Weekly News - July 13th, 1999
====================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.





**Storm Linux** is a new distribution
[based on Debian](http://stormix.com/). Its
motto is "*Storm Linux: we make linux look good*", and it seems they do
-- take a look at these [screenshots](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://stormix.com/about/screen_shots.html). The developer of Storm is R Garth Wood, who has been
[active](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg00632.html)
on debian-devel for a while. There has been little reaction to this
development though a report on a test install has been
[posted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg00685.html).





**The web site** now has a page for the
[Hurd port](https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/). It covers installation,
development, etc. Speaking of the web site, it finally **uses the new
logo**. And the
[results](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9907/msg00005.html) are in for the logo swap vote: **the logos have been swapped**.
Go forth and use the swirl.




There's been an increasing amount of discussion about **freezing and release
plans** this week. From
[talk](https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-9907/msg00016.html)
on the new debian-release list about shortening the release cycle to a discussion
about whether a
[September
release](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg00907.html) is possible (with a freeze very soon), the idea is in the air.




Lalo Martins [posted](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/27/mail#mail1) about **internationalizing Debian's
init scripts**. It's turning into a more general discussion about init script
output, see [this proposal](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/27/mail#mail2) for example.




Here is a [complete system](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg00746.html) for **generating diffs between debian packages** and
applying those diffs. This could be used to "*seriously reduce download
times*"




As usual, we have some [news](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/27/mail#mail3) from the **Debian-JP
project**. One thing they're dealing with is translating the copyright of
software that is documented only in Japanese.




**Many packages remain broken after the perl update.**
The
[next planned step](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9907/msg00007.html) is to file important bugs against these packages and
quickly make non maintainer releases of them.




Thanks to Christian Meder and Katsura S. Yoshio for
