Debian Weekly News - May 17th, 1999
===================================



**Welcome** to the 20th issue of Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the
Debian developer community.




It seems that Apple is
[planning](http://www.stepwise.com/SpecialCoverage/WWDC99/MondayAfternoon.html) to **use dpkg as the package manager for Darwin**. "*The
Debian packaging system has been adopted for the Darwin distribution, and
should be fairly easily moved to Mac OS X Server if someone were inclined
to try.*" In fact, you can download dpkg from this
[page
at Apple](http://www.opensource.apple.com/projects/darwin/1.2/projects.html) though oddly you have to get an account to download it.




There was another
[long
discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9905/msg00788.html)
about **how to switch to perl 5.005**. There's still a fair amount of
confusion about how to accomplish this cleanly, though the maintainer thinks
he has a viable solution according to [this message](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/20/mail#mail1).




**A Debian Users Group has been
[formed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9905/msg00864.html) in Philadelphia.** This seems to be a growing trend.. Also, **another
chance to meet fellow Debianites is coming up at Linux Expo**; several
developers will be there.




Stefan Gybas posted a [long message](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/20/mail#mail2) about **the status
of Linuxconf and Debian**. It's further along than one might think, and
should be moving out of experimental and into unstable soon. A lot of work
remains to be done to tie various parts of it into Debian.




The Debian JP project is working on an i18n framework that would **let the
Description field of packages be translated**. Details are available
[here](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://www.debian.or.jp/Lists-Archives/debian-devel/199905/msg00187.html) (in Japanese).




[Here's](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://www.zdnet.com/enterprise/linux/opinion/0,5954,2257226,00.html) a **ZDNet article on Corel and Debian**. It wavers between the
vaguely positive -- "*For some users, in fact, Corel could be the
corporate face that Debian has always lacked.*", and the disturbing --
"*Corel's choice will certainly give Debian a bigger audience by
dispensing with some of Debian's political agenda.*". What political
agenda? This was followed up by
[another article](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://www.zdnet.com/enterprise/linux/opinion/0,5954,2260109,00.html), which theorizes that the "GNU" in the name of Debian may
be scaring off users. Again he accuses Debian of being political: "*those
in our world who believe in manipulating language for political means insist
on the term GNU/Linux*".




**Some quick notes about other architectures**: New sparc bootdisks are
[available](https://lists.debian.org/debian-sparc-9905/msg00104.html) for testing thanks to Eric Delaunay. Martin Lucina has written
a new
[TGA framebuffer driver](https://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha-9905/msg00081.html) for Alphas.




**Help wanted**:



* Nils Lohner
[posted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity-9905/msg00002.html) about a lot of **debian-publicity related things that need
doing**.
* Bob Hilliard is
[compiling](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9905/msg00021.html) **release notes for potato**. If you have information that
would be useful to a user who is upgrading, send it
[to him](mailto:hilliard@flinet.com).



**Server news**:



* Over the weekend, **the Packages file for potato became a zero byte file due
to a problem with the archive**. Here's
[a note](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9905/msg00963.html)
about the cause of that and some other changes that have been made to the ftp
site. The problem with the Packages file impacted a lot of people who track
unstable, but it is fixed now. Unfortunately this messed up the program Debian
Weekly News uses to find new packages, and so that report is not available
this week.
* **The introduction of the new non-us server caused a fair amount of
confusion** about how to upload things to it and get them put in the proper
section. Guy Maor posted an
[explanation](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9905/msg00015.html).
