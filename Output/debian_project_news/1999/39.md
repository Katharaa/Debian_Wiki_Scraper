Debian Weekly News - October 12th, 1999
=======================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.





**It's official: Debian is not currently accepting new members.** Wichert
Akkerman
[posted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9910/msg00003.html)
explaining the situation:
"*As you may have heard or even experienced yourself, Debian's
new-maintainer team is currently not processing requests.
The team wanted to resolve some problems they observed with the way
Debian maintainership is current[ly] handled, and decided to close
new-maintainer until these have been fixed.*" He also explained what is
being done to rectify the situation:
"*We are currently working on a new structure for handling new-maintainer
requests, and hope to have this finished as soon as possible. There will
be a proposal on this posted on the debian-devel list in the near
future.
Once the new structure is in place new-maintainer will be reopened, and
we will make an announcement.*"




**Freeze watch**: Debian is still scheduled to freeze on November first,
just a few weeks away. Some work towards the release this week included:



* **Boot-floppies for potato were just uploaded.** Though this is an
"*early access Alpha version*", it's
[very good
news](https://lists.debian.org/deity-9910/msg00038.html) since it marks the first time potato has had boot floppies of any
kind. It now takes one floppy more to install: the rescue disk has split
into boot and root disks. Apt will be the only install method on the new
floppies, and
[work has
begun](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-9910/msg00211.html) on an apt configurator to walk new users through setting up apt.
* Anthony Towns did some investigation to find how many packages currently
in Debian are not installable because of unmet dependencies. His
[report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg00446.html) lists reasonably low numbers, around 80 per architecture.
The two ports we are not going to release with potato have significantly
more problems.




**Debian in a box** should start appearing in stores soon. The boxed set
includes the new O'Reilly Debian book. Read all about it on
[News.com](http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-850000.html), and
in the [New York Times](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://www.mercurycenter.com/premium/business/docs/linux12.htm). The whole O'Reilly book is also available
[online](http://www.ora.com/catalog/debian/chapter/).




In an effort to **reduce non-technical discussions on debian-devel**, a
debian-project mailing list has been
[created](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9910/msg00004.html). It is an open list for organizational and if necessary, political discussions.




**Debian booths are popping up at shows all over.**
Jules Bean posted a
[report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg00515.html)
of Debian's presence as Linux Expo in London. And here's a
[report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-news-99/msg00039.html) of
Debian's presence at the Pluto Meeting in Italy. Of course, Atlanta Linux
Showcase is fast approaching, and lots of Debian people will be at our booth
there.




As usual,
[here](http://www2.osk.3web.ne.jp/~shishamo/debian/trans/djwn/wn101199.html) is the Debian JP news for this week.




**New packages** in Debian this week include the following and
[41 more](http://master.debian.org/~tausq/newpkgs.html):



* [obliq](https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/interpreters/obliq.html): An
