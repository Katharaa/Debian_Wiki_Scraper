Debian Weekly News - September 21st, 1999
=========================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.




**Debconf has been released.** Debconf is a configuration management tool
that lets Debian packages ask questions at install time using several
different interfaces. Plain text, dialog, GTK and web UI's are currently
supported, as well as non-interactive installations. It will support remote
databases in the future, allowing whole clusters of machines to be configured
the same. Read the
[introduction
to Debconf](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg01500.html) for more information. Quite a few people are eager to begin using
it soon.





**Corel has started a closed beta test of their Corel Linux distribution.**
Unfortunately, they did so under a very restrictive license, that
[violates](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/09/20/1051226&mode=nested) the GPL in several respects. The good news is that Bruce Perens
has already
[contacted
Corel](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-9909/msg02660.html) and we're promised that this will be fixed.




The debian-laptop list has made a
[proposal](http://home.snafu.de/wehe/debian_linux.html) for
**making Debian more laptop friendly**. The idea is to create special laptop
kernels, plus a laptop meta package that pulls together everything a laptop
user needs. There seems to be "*no Linux distribution with a dedicated
laptop support*" yet, so Debian would be leading the way in this area.




**Should proftpd be moved to contrib for security reasons?** Many security
holes have been found in it lately and it seems likely more will show up in the
future, so some think it's a good idea to
[move it
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg01433.html) of the main distribution. The maintainer prefers to
[wait
and see](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg01434.html) what the situation is like when we freeze.




Joey Hess [posted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg01283.html) what he confesses is a "*crazy idea*": Fly all the
developers into a central location and have a **debian conference**. Many
people would like to go to such an event and think it'd be a good thing for
Debian and a lot of fun. But of course, no one knows where we could find the
large amount of money this would take, or what could possibly be considered
a central location for such a distributed project.




Here's the [Debian JP News](http://www2.osk.3web.ne.jp/~shishamo/debian/trans/djwn/wn091999.html) for this week. It includes an interesting "*virtual apt
server*" that generates packages apt requests, from a running Debian
system, using dpkg-repack.

**Followups** to last week's news:



* In the wake of last week's changes to the Bug Tracking System, Darren
Benham posted a
[summary](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg01579.html)
of the changes he's made so far. The biggest changes are that old fixed bugs are never
deleted anymore, they are archived, and that the BTS fully supports PGP/GPG signed
and mime formatted email.
* The Debian Quality Assurance [web site](https://qa.debian.org/)
is up.
