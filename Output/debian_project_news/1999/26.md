Debian Weekly News - July 6th, 1999
===================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.





**Perl 5.005 is here.** To handle the transition to this new
version, [perl is now a versioned package](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg00016.html) -- perl 5.004 can be installed
alongside the newer version during the transition. All packages that
currently depend on perl need to be changed to depend on perl5, and anyone who
maintains such a package has been sent a notice about this (here's a
[sample](https://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg-9907/msg00001.html)).
There is also a new
[perl policy](http://pandora.debian.org/~hertzog/perl-policy.html/)
which packages should follow. However, until all packages that depend on
perl are updated,
[unstable
is in an inconsistent state](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg00260.html) and should only be followed by the very brave.





With the new policy requiring the use of the FHS, the question of **how to
move from /usr/doc to /usr/share/doc** has come up (again). Simply symlinking
the two isn't good enough, because dpkg won't deal with it well.
[One
idea](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9907/msg00003.html) that has come up a few times is to make /usr/doc/*package* be a
link to /usr/share/doc/*package*.




**A new mailing list named debian-release** has been
[created](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9907/msg00000.html), for coordination between people involved in release management.
"*The debian-release mailing list is an \*action\* list.*" -- it's not
meant for general discussion. Speaking of releases, the
[release-critical bug
list](http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/) is being posted again each week. The latest version lists a
**whopping 222 release critical bugs**. Also, Richard Braakman posted about
his [plans
for release management](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg00217.html). Some of the packages with release critical bugs
will soon be marked for removal.




Jason Gunthorpe
[posted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-9906/msg00235.html)
a "*Negative Summary of the Split Proposal*". This is an **excellent
summary of arguments against the proposed move of non-free and contrib**.
His larger aim, besides defeating the proposal, is to make these summaries,
both pro and con, a regular part of the voting process. The split proposal
hasn't gone to vote yet, but we do have one vote in progress: The logo swap
vote closes on July 7th. If you haven't voted yet, get a ballot
[here](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9907/msg00001.html).




There was an
[long
argument](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg00045.html) between Per Abrahamsen and others about **Debian developers'
relationships with upstream authors**. Per thinks that developers often act
as "*middlemen*" who get in the way more often than not between users and
authors. He also dislikes the debian-specific modifications made to XEmacs.
Of course, many developers disagreed and gave counterexamples of good
relationships with upstream. Adam Di Carlo posted an
[excellent
list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg00087.html) of things Debian developers should do to ensure such good relations
with their packages' authors.




Here is a [summary](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/26/mail#mail1) of **what's happening on the Debian-JP
project**.




**New packages** added this week include the following and
[31 more](http://master.debian.org/~tausq/newpkgs.html):
