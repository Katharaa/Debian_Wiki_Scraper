Debian Weekly News - November 17th, 1999
========================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.




Wichert Akkerman
[posted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9911/msg00013.html) the **Debian Machine Usage Policy**, a comprehensive description
of what is and is not acceptable use of Debian project machines by developers.
It was greeted with mixed feelings; some people feel this is an
[unnecessary
document](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-9911/msg00027.html), and expect people to just do the right thing. Others think the
project has gotten too big to not have a usage policy of this sort in place,
and point out that it has in fact been
[violated](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-9911/msg00034.html)
in the past.




**Another bugsquash party will be held this weekend.**
[Participate](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9911/msg00021.html)
on Saturday and help us "*splatter bug juice all over the dist!*"




**Three security fixes were released this week:** A new version of BIND has
been
[released](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-9911/msg02035.html)
that fixes a remote root exploit. The security fixes were also
[backported to stable](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/44/mail#mail1). Also, a
[new version of
proftpd](https://www.debian.org/security/1999/19991111a) for stable has been released, fixing a number of security holes.
And finally, a fix for a nfs-server buffer overflow has been
[released for stable](https://www.debian.org/security/1999/19991111).




Vincent Renardias has made [available](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/44/mail#mail2) a **Y2K update for
Slink**, with fixes for every known Y2K problem in Slink except a small Y2K
problem in nethack (which still has no known fix).





**Corel Linux has been released.** A few developers have looked at it and
given some initial opinions which range from "*the feeling I get is not of
a new operating system, but of a stripped-down Debian with KDE, and some more
flashy graphics*" to "*it will make a great desktop to keep users happy
and debian under the bonet to keep us admins happy*". The important
point is that it is a Debian system with [few modified
packages](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/44/mail#mail3), and apt-get and dpkg continue to work.




**A new "*science*" section has been added to the ftp site** alongside
the existing sections like mail and games. Anyone who maintains packages that
belong in the new section should [contact James Troup](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/44/mail#mail4).





The Bug Tracking System has
[passed](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/db/ix/summary.html) the **50,000
bug mark**. A bit more than 8 thousand of those bugs remain open, so
Debian has fixed over 41 thousand bugs. Good work, everyone.




**Some Debian merchandise is available at Copyleft.** No shirts yet, but they
have nice [black](http://copyleft.net/cgi-bin/copyleft/d001.pl)
and [white](http://copyleft.net/cgi-bin/copyleft/d002.pl)
frisbees with the Debian logo on them.




A [ton of new
packages](http://master.debian.org/~tausq/newpkgs.html) were added to Debian this week, with the new larger archive
maintenance team working hard to get new packages into Debian in record time.
