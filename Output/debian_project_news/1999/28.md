Debian Weekly News - July 20th, 1999
====================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. I'm on vacation this week so this issue is a day late.




**Is Bruce Back?** Bruce Perens was
[interviewed](http://linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1999-06/lw-06-perens.html) in LinuxWorld and talks about Debian: "*After a bad year,
Debian has started going for users. It has a new project leader, Wichert
Akkerman, and a deal with Corel, who will package a commercial version of
Debian and KDE*". And then he drops this bombshell: "*Some of my old
Debian packages need a maintainer, and I'll probably take them up again.*".




**The design specification for DpkgV2** has been
[released](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9907/msg00012.html). It is a very modular design, and the most interesting feature is
support for numerous different package formats. DpkgV2 is intended to be
used mostly as a library from within other front end tools.




An interesting development from the Debian-JP project is a **single floppy ftp
server** using Debian. For details and other news, see the
[Debian-JP news](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/28/mail#mail2).




Linux Gazette posted an
[article](http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue43/bennet.html) about
**installing Debian via a PLIP link** if you lack CD and ethernet. It sure
beats 6 floppies..




Red Hat's recent [offer](http://slashdot.org/articles/99/07/20/2129218.shtml) to let members of the linux community buy shares of their stock
before their IPO was **sent to every developer on the Debian keyring**. While
some people view this offer and the way is was presented as [akin to spam](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/28/mail#mail4), others do [appreciate it](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/28/mail#mail3).




**Local events**:



* **Philadelphia Area Debian Society** (PADS)
[will
meet](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg01060.html) on Wednesday to continue talking about Debian's policy. Chris
Fearnley is speaking.



**Server news** for this week revolves around disk problems and fixes:



* Jason Gunthorpe from the debian-admin team reports that the Alpha and Sparc
Debian development machines Faure, Kubrick and Albert
[are
down](https://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha-9907/msg00096.html) due to a broken hard disk.
* The good news is that saens is now
[back
online](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg01352.html) with a replacement for the disk that died three weeks ago, and
ftp.debian.org will return to that server.
* Jason also posted
[a plea](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www-9907/msg00062.html)
that "*if there is any way to reduce the size of the web site, please do it
now*". The problem is **we are running out of space on va because the list
archives and BTS continue to grow in size every day**. In response to that,
list archives for 1996 and 1997 were [removed](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/28/mail#mail1) from the
web site (they are still available in mbox format).



**Followups** to last week's news:



* The question of how to handle the transition to the FHS's /usr/share/doc
directory is still unresolved. Manoj has made a
[proposal](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=40706) that
has received a lot of favorable attention, but several people still object
to it.
* Kevin Lindsay and Atsushi Ikeda are equal co-contributors on the Storm
linux team along with R Garth Wood, and we're told the team is growing.
