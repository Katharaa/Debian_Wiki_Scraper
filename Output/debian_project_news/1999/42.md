Debian Weekly News - November 2nd, 1999
=======================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.




**The freeze has been postponed until November 7th**.
The Release Manager was unable to coordinate the freeze this past weekend.
The bugsquash party did go ahead as planned, and around 75
[release critical bugs](http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/)
were fixed in one day. Read Richard Braakman's [email](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/42/mail#mail2) for
details about how the freeze will work, including the new "*Test Cycles*"
process.




**Build dependencies** are being discussed again this week. A proposal
specifying how they will work has been accepted and should be in the next
version of policy, which is due out soon. Using that as a base, Roman Hodek
[posted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9910/msg00318.html) a "*vision for the future*" of how build dependencies can be
used by different programs in the future. But Julian Gilbey
[points
out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9910/msg00322.html) that figuring out what a package really depends on to build, to
generate the build dependencies entry, can be quite hard.




Ben Collins has made an **experimental version of dpkg** available, with
several [new features](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg02053.html) that have been wanted for a long time, including internally
signed packages, and bzip2 compression support.





Last week Debian Weekly News dropped the ball when we didn't mention a
**copyright problem with apt and Corel's "*get\_it*" apt frontend**, which
is a Qt program. Since it was linked to the GPLed libapt, there was a
[licence
conflict](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-9910/msg00045.html).
Jason Gunthorpe and Corel quietly [resolved](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/42/mail#mail1) this
problem by changing apt's license to allow linking apt and Qt. Linux Weekly
News laster posted an interesting [editorial](http://lwn.net/1999/1028/) about this. It seemed the issue was closed.




Then this week, Ian Jackson brought up
[another
issue](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-9910/msg00118.html): "*lib-apt isn't the only thing that is bound together at run-time
with Qt in this program. dpkg is too - the fact that the interface is program
call rather than dynamic linking is an irrelevant technical detail.*" Ian
isn't about to change dpkg's license, and he is presumably talking with Corel
about this in private. Meanwhile, this spawned a long, murky thread on
debian-legal, since the law is very unclear on this and many people,
including RMS and Bruce Perens,
[disagree](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-9911/msg00018.html) with Ian's reasoning.




**BIND is once more in main.** A
[patch](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg02195.html)
from Paul Vixie allows easy removal of the non-free DNNSEC code.




**New packages** in Debian this week include the following and 36 more:



* [debian-cd](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/debian-cd): Tools
for building (Official) Debian CD set
* [flick](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/flick): Flexible IDL
Compiler Kit
([dev](https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/devel/flick-dev.html),
 [doc](https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/devel/flick-doc.html))
 * jzip: Text mode interpreter for Z-Code adventures, etc.
* [lwm](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/lwm): Lightweight
Window Manager
* [pciutils-dev](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/pciutils-dev):
Linux PCI Utilities (for 2.[123].x kernels) (development files)
