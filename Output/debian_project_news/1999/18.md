Debian Weekly News - May 3rd, 1999
==================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian
developer community.





The
[results](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9905/msg00001.html) are in for the vote on number of logos and licenses. **There
will be two logos with different licenses.** Voting on the actual logo
is [about to begin](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/18/mail#mail2).




**The long awaited new version of X** has finally been
[uploaded to unstable](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-9904/msg02409.html). Some major changes have been made to
the source packaging, and of course it's a new upstream version of X as
well. Also, the contents of the **GNOME staging area**  are ready for
broader use and testing and have been
[copied
to Incoming](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9905/msg00022.html).




**Should clients that can communicate only with non-free servers be placed in
contrib?** James Troup raised this very contentious issue when he
[posted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9905/msg00004.html) about his reason for rejecting the ICQ client TiK from Incoming.
One major objection is that this would imply that a program that parses
freshmeat or the dejanews web pages must go in contrib because the code that
generates those web sites is not published. If we decide to follow James's
reasoning, a great deal of software will be moved to contrib.




Joey Hess has
[proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg01655.html) **large modifications of debhelper for version 2.0**. These
modifications will require an environment variable to be set to enable them,
so backwards compatibility is not broken by default. The aim of the
modifications is to make debhelper's interface cleaner and easier to learn.
After some discussion the changes to make are
[nearly
agreed on](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9905/msg00037.html). **Debhelper has some new competition: Yet Another
Debianization Aid** (YADA) was
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg01729.html) this week. It centralizes all information needed to build a
package into a single file, similar to an RPM spec file.




**A few problems with Debian Alpha**:
Attempting to upgrade a Debian Alpha machine to glibc 2.1 is likely to
[break the system](https://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha-9905/msg00007.html) unless apt is used for the upgrade. And egcs is
[producing
invalid code](https://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha-9904/msg00205.html) when optimizing with -O2.




**News from Debian Sparc is brighter**:
Upgrading to glibc 2.1 is no problem now if you have a 2.2.x kernel, and
[new
sparc bootdisks](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-9905/msg00006.html) will be ready soon.




**Attention Finns**: On May 15th there will be a Debian
[meeting](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/18/mail#mail1) in Finland.





Joey Hess has started posting **weekly summaries of proposals on the
debian-policy list**. The first summary is
[here](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9905/msg00000.html).




**New packages** added to Debian this week include the following and 13
[other packages](http://master.debian.org/~tausq/newpkgs.html):



* [birthday](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/birthday):
Display information about pending events on login
* blacs: Basic Linear Algebra Communications Subprograms
([mpi](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?../../../../Packages/unstable/devel/blacs-mpi.html) and
[pvm](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?../../../../Packages/unstable/devel/blacs-pvm.html) versions)
* [dhis](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?../../../../Packages/unstable/net/dhis.html): allocates
a hostname under dhis.org to your host

**Correction**:



* Thanks to the several people who pointed out that the url to the logrotate
proposal was wrong -- the proposal is actually
[here](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg01069.html).
