Debian Weekly News - April 19th, 1999
=====================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian
developer community.





**Voting on the license for the Debian logo has begun.** The vote also
encompasses the number of logos that will be used, either one or two.
For details on the options, see the
[call for votes](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9904/msg00021.html) and then
[cast your ballot](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9904/msg00023.html). Of course, only developers can vote.





**Corel is going to release a Debian variant**, according to a
[news.com
article](http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,35166,00.html). "*Corel will base a Linux product [..] on the version of
Linux from Debian.*" Corel appears to be interested in improving
Debian's ease of installation and use and bundling it with WordPerfect
and other Corel software. They plan to release a beta by August. Debian has
made no official announcement about this yet.




An interesting development in the past couple of weeks has been more
**mainstream online press stories referencing and linking to items that
originate on the Debian mailing lists**. For example,
[here's](http://www.salonmagazine.com/tech/feature/1999/04/15/linux_help/index.html) a Salon Magazine story with a link buried in the middle to the
"clueless users" post from 3 weeks ago. And
[here's](http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?back=archive99/now0409.txt)
an article on the Perens/Raymond mess with links to postings on our mailing
lists. Unfortunately, none of these links cast Debian in a very positive
light. Other more positive references to Debian in the press this week
include **a few mentions in Linux Journal issue #61**, where Debian is
revealed as the distribution of choice for one author's PPP servers, and for
another's remotely upgradable secure Internet gateways.




**Work is beginning on a Chinese translation project.**
Some of Debian's web pages have been
[translated to Chinese](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www-9904/msg00036.html). The debian-chinese mailing list has been created.
The Chinese translation effort is being coordinated by Anthony Wong. If you
would like to help out with the project, subscribe to the
debian-chinese mailing list.
