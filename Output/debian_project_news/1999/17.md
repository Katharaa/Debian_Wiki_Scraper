Debian Weekly News - April 26th, 1999
=====================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian
developer community.





**It's official -- Corel will base their Linux distribution on Debian.**
According to Corel's
[press
release](http://www.corel.com/news/1999/april/april_21_1999.htm) "*Corel will also build its desktop Linux offering around the
Debian GNU/Linux distribution, which already has one of the largest installed
bases in the Linux community, and is known for its stability and security.*"
Corel representatives are already making their
[first
postings](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-9904/msg03210.html) to the lists.





**The Bug Tracking System went down** on the 21st when the machine it
resides on was upgraded to Linux 2.2 (to work around a SCSI problem). It
seems Linux 2.2 doesn't completely support a.out binaries, and the BTS
uses an old a.out smail binary that the upgrade
[broke](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9904/msg00024.html). The BTS was down for 4 days before it could be fixed to use exim
as its mailer. No data should have been lost, though some people submitting bugs
in the downtime may have received odd messages from debbugs.debian.org.




Jason Gunthorpe, our very own BOFH, has been working on the long anticipated
**LDAP-enabled developer database**, and has merged in everyone in the
Debian keyring into it. The resulting database can be queried in many useful ways.
Jason's first uses of it were to generate a [report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg01434.html) of
people who are in the keyring but lack an account on master,
and then to generate a
[list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg01490.html)
of accounts that are for people not in the Debian keyring. The BOFH element
-- "*All of these are on the chopping block and will be terminated
'eventually'*". If you're on the list you should contact Jason.




**Dale Scheetz has resigned from his post of Secretary of the SPI board**,
[citing](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg01461.html)
scarce free time that he'd rather spend on the LSB and other projects. Nils
Lohner will probably become Secretary, and the board is expected to seek a new
Treasurer.




In case you've not noticed, Debian has a [web
page](https://www.debian.org/y2k/) listing **y2k status of our packages**. Craig Small is
maintaining this page, and he has
[requested](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg01121.html) for people to [mail him](mailto:csmall@debian.org)
if you know of pages that address the y2k compliance of other packages.




**Rotation of logfiles** has been the topic of some discussions this
week. There's been a
[proposal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg01069.html)
to move from using savelog to using logrotate (developed by Red Hat), since
logrotate seems to be a more flexible tool and savelog can even
[lose data](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg01466.html)
in some very rare situations. Logrotate has been packaged and
[uploaded](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-9904/msg02158.html).




**All the new packages added to Debian this week are from the Hurd port**:



* gnumach: The GNU version of the Mach microkernel and devel files
* hurd and hurd-dev: The GNU Hurd and associated development files
* libc0.2: The GNU C library version 2



Thanks to Randolph Chung for
[contributing](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/contributing) the new packages list
each week.
