Debian Weekly News - June 8th, 1999
===================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.





**The logo results are in**: The
[Swirl logo](https://www.debian.org/vote/1999/raul-0.gif) is the
winner. Its first appearance: gracing a rather nice
[banner ad](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://themes.org/banners/debian_banner.gif) at the
top of [themes.org](http://www.themes.org/). Even a
[Window Maker
theme](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://wm.themes.org/minithemes.cgi?search=debian) based on the logo and
[scalable postscript](http://www.spinnaker.de/debian/logo/)
versions of the logo are available now. But this saga isn't
over yet: a
[proposal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-9906/msg00001.html)
has been made to switch the official and liberal use
logos.




**The security team** is
[working](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg00543.html)
on a new site, [security.debian.org](http://security.debian.org/)
where they can upload security fixes immediately without waiting on the
maintainer or even for a dinstall and mirror run. This should get important
fixes out ASAP. One such fix is a [new version of ipopd](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/23/mail#mail1)
that fixes a remote shell hole.





**SPI is now an official US non-profit organization.** Among other things,
this means that Donations to SPI are now [tax-deductible](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/23/mail#mail2)
for US taxpayers.




With the latest version of dpkg (1.4.1.3) to hit the archive, it's
finally possible to **list fixed bugs in the changelog and have them
automatically closed by dinstall**. No more mailing bugs.debian.org
directly...




Here's an interesting twist - an
[offer](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-9906/msg00304.html)
has been made on the [Free
Software Bazaar](http://visar.csustan.edu/bazaar/bazaar.html) for some enhancements to apt's download methods. **Complete
the modifications and get 50 Euro.**




**Mozilla M6 has been Debianized.** This is particularly good news on the
Debian/Alpha platform, which now has a fairly well working graphical web browser
for the [first time](https://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha-9906/msg00043.html).




[Linux Laptops](http://www.linuxlaptops.com/) is a **new hardware
company that sells laptops preloaded**. They
[put Debian](http://www.linuxlaptops.com/ll/software.html) on all
their systems. "*We chose Debian for several reasons. The most important
is that it has earned its reputation as the most reliable distribution.*"




Corel now has a
[FAQ](http://www.corel.com/news/1999/may/may_1999_faqs.htm) which
explains **why they chose Debian**: "*Debian has a solid charter, a strong
worldwide developer base and a thorough testing period. These three factors
have contributed to the most comprehensive and cleanest code that provides
Corel and its customers with the most robust operating system.*"




Quite a few opportunities to meet fellow Debianites are coming up:



* A Debian BOF has been [organized](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/23/mail#mail4) at Usenix.
It's this Thursday at 7pm.
* On June 15th, the [Bay Area Linux User's
Group](http://www.balug.org/) will hold a **Benefit Dinner for Debian**. Linus Torvalds is the
speaker, and VA Linux Systems and LinuxCare are [contributing](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/23/mail#mail3) $10 to Debian for each person who attends.
There will also be a sizable number of developers present.
* There will be a
[gathering
of developers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg00053.html) including the Project Leader, Wichert Akkerman, during the
Paris Linux Expo on the 17th or 18th.



**New packages** added to Debian this week include the following and
[29 more](http://master.debian.org/~tausq/newpkgs.html):



* [gsfonts-x11](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/gsfonts-x11): Make Ghostscript fonts available to X11
* [knfs](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?../../../../Packages/unstable/net/knfs.html): Kernel NFS Server Tools
* [stalin](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/stalin): An extremely aggressive Scheme compiler
* [theme-converters](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/theme-converters): Convert WindowMaker/GTK+ theme packages to .debs



**Followups** to last week's news:



* In marked contrast to last week's gloomy discussion of Debian at expos,
check out [this sweet deal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg00360.html) from LinuxWorld Expo. They're providing Debian with a free
booth and all the trimmings, in a "*.org pavilion [...] that will be
designated as an area to foster the open style that the Linux Community stands
for. Ideas will be shared, video games will be played, lounging will be on
couches, and snacks will be enjoyed.*"



Thanks to Katsura S. Yoshio and Christian Meder for
[contributing](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/contributing).




Closing with a personal note -- DWN is late this week and will probably be
late next week because I'm moving. The good news is that **VA Linux Systems
has hired Sean Perry and me to work on Debian full time**,
