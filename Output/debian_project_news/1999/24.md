Debian Weekly News - June 22nd, 1999
====================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. This is a special two week combined issue since I was unable to
publish last week. I am now looking for a
[substitute editor](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/contributing#subeditor).




In the wake of the logo vote, a few developers have [surfaced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg00703.html) who didn't hear about the vote until the results were announced
and are understandably upset about not getting a chance to vote. This
perhaps points to a larger problem: though all developers are supposed to
subscribe to debian-devel-announce, not all do. So **there is no way to
ensure every developer sees an announcement**. One fix that's been
discussed is auto-subscribing all developers to debian-devel-announce.
Debian Weekly News encourages anyone who wants to make sure they don't miss
this type of thing in the future to at least read DWN regularly.




Wichert Akkerman has proposed **splitting non-free and contrib out to a new
server**, nonfree.debian.org. The impetus for this is to emphasize
that they are not part of Debian, since "*the distinction isn't as visible
as it used to be; advances in searching in the distribution and tools like
apt make it very hard to see when something is in main and when not*".
The proposal will come up for a vote soon and is generating lots of
discussion.





**The issue of signing debs has come up again.** Interestingly, Wichert
Akkerman [says](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg01438.html) that "*we will support multiple verification methods within a year*"
(presumably this is related to the dpkg v2 project). Manoj Srivastava posted a
[good
overview](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg01428.html) of the security issues related to signing packages and some
workarounds.




Speaking of security, a **new version of man-db that fixes a symlink
attack** has been [released](http://lwn.net/1999/0617/a/debman-db.html).




Dale Scheetz posted to debian-private (reposted [here](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/24/mail#mail1) with
his permission) about the problems with Official Debian CD's. "*Having an
Official CD has not stopped the delivery of broken CDs, and it doesn't protect
the vendor either.*" To help rectify this, he proposes sending CD's to
testers before publicly releasing them, and also setting up a process that
will let CD vendors put patches and other changes on the CD's and still call
them "Official".




Joost Witteveen, author of the menu package, has [released
version 2.0](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9906/msg00370.html) of that package, which incorporates a **neat new concept:
hints**. Read his post for details, but this should allow menu to optimize
the menu hierarchy it generates so there are no over-full or under-full menus.




The APT team has released a
[new
version of APT](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg01459.html). The most interesting new feature is **support for
downloading the sources of packages**. With a "--compile" switch, apt can
even launch a build of the package!




**A perl update.**
[Packages of perl
5.005](ftp://ftp.daft.com/pub/debian/experimental/) are finally
[ready for testing](https://lists.debian.org/debian-perl-9906/msg00020.html). Maintainers of perl modules and other interested
parties should read the new
[perl policy](http://pandora.debian.org/~hertzog/perl-policy.txt).




**Debian events**:



* **Both Ian Jackson and James Troup will be speaking** at the
[Linux '99
Conference](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg01233.html) in the UK. It's on the 25th and 26th.
* **The Philadelphia Debian GNU/Linux User's Group**
[met](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg00954.html) on
the 16th. The meeting topic was "*An Overview of Debian Policy*"
(DWN apologizes for not publicizing this in time for the meeting.)
* **About $7000 was donated to Debian** by LinuxCare and VA at the [Debian
benefit](http://kitenet.net/auto/pipermail/bad/1999-June/000213.html). There were also a few posters given out by LinuxCare that are
similar to a certain other infamous poster.



On debian-policy there was a
[discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9906/msg00313.html) **about the undocumented.7 man page** and whether it's
really useful at all. Some feel that "*The undocumented(7) link is not only
useless, but actively annoying.*"




**A few tidbits from the Debian JP project.** Debian JP is doing a
survey of use of their packages, results
[here](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://www.debian.or.jp/~maehara/popcon/). It seems that
their announcement of plans to merge with Debian backfired a little bit with
people thinking the project had quit. In fact their work on Japanese
localized packages continues.




**Server news**:



* John Goerzen has
[set
up](https://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha-9906/msg00081.html) a **wanna-build database and an autobuilder for the Debian Alpha
port**.
