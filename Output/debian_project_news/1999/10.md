Debian Weekly News - March 8th, 1999
====================================



**Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian
developer community.





**Debian 2.1 is officially released**, for real this time. The release
went off quite smoothly, with no last minute emergencies. More information
on [this page](https://www.debian.org/News/1999/19990309).
Congratulations, all.




**The Debian booth at LinuxWorld expo was a great success.** We talked to
large numbers of people, recruited new developers, and gave away a ton of
free CD's. Wichert also talked to a large number of companies who are
interested in Debian; press releases will probably start appearing about
the results of those talks.





The [Empeg](http://www.empeg.com) in-car mp3 player runs Debian and
was at our booth at LinuxWorld. **This device generated a lot of interest**,
including this
[Wired
Article](http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/18236.html). Never expect the media to get things quite right: *"The Empeg
player is being shown at the back of the Debian booth and runs the
*company's* distribution of Linux. "* (It was front and center in
the booth and of course Debian isn't a company.)




Our booth also received a coveted Slashdot LinuxWorld
[award](http://slashdot.org/articles/99/03/04/143225.shtml)
for **Highest Density EMF in a Booth**. "*I think they've got 38
computers, an empeg, and more geeks than I thought possible in a 10x10
space. Next show they'll have to build shelves and stack them.*"




**Linux Weekly News** used our booth as a place to write LWN on March 4th.
Their comments on the booth:
"*Way back [...] was 'the ghetto,' where the likes of the Free Software
Foundation, Debian, Slashdot, and others hung out. Fortunately, lots of
people found their way back there; the Debian booth, for example, has been
generally unapproachable. [...] the Debian folks at LinuxWorld have been
great, providing a nice place for Liz to stash and recharge her laptop. It's
been fun getting to meet so many of you!*" Nice meeting you too..




**A lot of Debian people got together for dinner on Wednesday after the
expo**, 22 people attended in all, even Bruce Perens was there.




If the above isn't enough information about LinuxWorld,
**annotated pictures of Debian people at the event** are
[here](https://www.debian.org/~joeyh/linuxworld/), and there are
also summaries of
[day 1](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://netgod.net/~slash/articles/99/03/03/1853202_F.shtml)
and
[day 2](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/oldurl?http://netgod.net/~slash/articles/99/03/03/196233_F.shtml).




**Spurred by the release date slipping last week**, here are some
[thoughts about release management](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9903/msg00343.html) by Richard Braakman.
In addition to proposing a number of changes in the way
responsibilities are delegated for a new release and tasks that would need
to be complete before a release could be frozen, he proposes a lengthy
development time of several months and short freeze time of two to three
weeks. This might be worth considering for the Potato release.
Also,
[here](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9903/msg00477.html) is a summary by Brandon Mitchell of previous discussions on this
topic.




**Ian Jackson is
[working](https://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg-9903/msg00034.html) on dpkg again**, merging in all fixes made in NMU's
in the past year or so.
His dpkg CVS tree is [available](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/10/mail#mail2) on VA.




**The debian-java mailing list is discussing a sub-policy for the Java
language.** The aim is to write this sub-policy (two drafts have been
presented), covering the packaging of Java compilers, Java virtual
machines and programs written in Java. All Java programmers or packagers
are invited to join in and give advice.




Ben Collins
[reports](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9903/msg00124.html) that the version of PAM
in potato is working correctly after fixing some 50+ bugs. **The
incorporation of PAM into Debian** can affect many different
packages (ftp, telnet, ssh, xdm, etc.) which might use this method of
authentication. As a result, he has proposed a mailing list for developers
whose packages might need to be integrated with PAM.




A
[suggestion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9903/msg00485.html) to make the "software which should be packaged" part of the
WNPP **a separate entity** was made recently and received positive
responses. The new creation will be more like a searchable and browsable
database.




**PC Magazine**
[reviewed several linux distributions](http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/features/opensource/390823.html) including Debian. It's short, a
bit harsh, but there's a lot of truth in there. Outside reviews are a great
way to find the trouble spots that one may have forgotten after using a
product for several years.




**There has been some work on GNOME 1.0.** A
[staging area has been set up](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9903/msg00003.html) for those that want to jump the gun and
install it now.




**Attention Finnish users and developers**: there will be a meeting in
Finland this weekend. Read the [announcement](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/1999/10/mail#mail1) (in Finnish)
for more information.




**The only security news this week** is that another buffer overflow was
[fixed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-9903/msg00082.html) in super.




**New packages** added to Debian this week include:



* [astyle](https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/devel/astyle.html): Artistic style, a source code indenter for C/C++ and Java
* Yet another shell:
[esh](https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/shells/esh.html), the
easy shell
* [gnudip](https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/net/gnudip.html): provides dynamic DNS services
* More Netscape packages than you can shake a stick at.



**Followups** to previous news items:



* Correction: The new ftp.debian.org has been up for two months now, last
issue of this newsletter said it was "*soon to arrive*".
* Correction: The Mac at the Debian booth at linuxworld was actually a Mac
SE/30, not just a Mac SE.
* The article on Slink is now available on the
[Open Resources](http://www.openresources.com/magazine/debian-21/)
website. It is comprehensive enough to serve as a valuable addition to the
Debian FAQ.



**Thanks to this week's contributors**: Michael Dahlberg, Randolph Chung,
Brandon Mitchell, and Stephane Bortzmeyer.
