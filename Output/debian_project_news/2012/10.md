Update for Debian 6.0: 6.0.5 released
-------------------------------------



The fifth [update for
Debian 6.0 (codenamed Squeeze)](https://www.debian.org/News/2012/20120512) has been released. This update
mainly adds corrections of security problems to the stable release,
along with some adjustments for serious problems.



Deadlines reminder for DebConf12
--------------------------------



Leandro GÃ³mez noted that the
[deadline
for sponsored registration for DebConf12 is quickly
approaching](http://leogg.wordpress.com/2012/05/08/are-you-going-to-debconf12/); hurry up and
[register](https://debconf12.debconf.org/register.xhtml) before Tuesday 15 May!




In related news, Gunnar Wolf sent another
[call
for papers](http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf12/gw_dc12_your_greatest_ideas.dc) for DebConf12: talk submissions will be accepted until a day before the
talk itself, but they must be submitted before Friday 1 June
to have guaranteed video coverage and
to be announced as part of the conference's official program.




Holger Levsen also reported on his recent
[visit
to Managua, Nicaragua](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2012/05/msg00026.html). The report includes a thematically sorted list of
impressions and advice you may be really interested in reading if you are considering
coming to DebConf12.
In short, it was great, DebConf12 will be great.



General Resolution about diversity statement
--------------------------------------------



The Debian Project Secretary, Kurt Roeckx, announced that the
[process for a General Resolution about the Debian
Project's diversity statement](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/05/msg00002.html) has been started.
Details are available on [the related vote page](https://www.debian.org/vote/2012/vote_002)
while the discussion can be followed on the
[debian-vote
mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2012/05/msg00011.html).



First alpha release of the installer for Debian Wheezy
------------------------------------------------------



The [new
Debian Installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/News/2012/20120513) supports WPA, uses ext4 as default filesystem,
allows Btrfs for the /boot partition, allows a choice of the ISO image
to use, and a lot more. It also improves the handling of ZFS file systems, and
supports a lot of new hardware. You are welcome to help finding bugs and
further improving the installer by trying it out.
[Installer CDs, other media and
everything else](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer) you will need are available.



The Debian Administrator's Handbook freed
-----------------------------------------



RaphaÃ«l Hertzog announced [the
availability of The Debian Administrator's Handbook](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2012/05/10/the-debian-administrators-handbook-is-available/). This
manual is the English translation of the French best-seller Cahier de
l'Admin, of which he is co-author with Roland Mas. The book is
now released under a [DFSG](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)
compliant license and it has also been packaged for the main Debian
repository, so you can install it on Debian unstable with:




```
apt-get install debian-handbook
```

An ever growing mirrors network
-------------------------------


Raphael Geissert wrote a blog post about the
[constant
growth of Debian's mirrors network](http://rgeissert.blogspot.it/2012/04/ever-growing-mirrors-network.html). The total number of mirrors is
currently 330 for the HTTP protocol and 300 for FTP.
The mirrors are distributed across 73 countries, thanks to the Debian
sponsors hosting them.



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Stefano Zacchiroli sent
[his
monthly report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/05/msg00001.html) on DPL activities. During April, Stefano mostly spent time
trying to reach consensus on various topics: the
[proposal
for a diversity statement for the Debian Project](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2012/03/msg00048.html), the
[revenue
sharing agreement](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2012/04/msg00101.html) with DuckDuckGo, the
[long
running conflict over Python maintenance](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=573745) and the
[relationship
between pkg-multimedia maintainers team and the unofficial
debian-multimedia.org repository](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-multimedia-maintainers/2012-April/026063.html).
In his mail, Stefano also asked for DPL helpers: volunteers to help
the Debian Project Leader in some minor tasks and share his work-load.



Other news
----------



Joerg Jaspert announced
[the
creation of a new archive key for Debian 7.0 Wheezy](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/05/msg00000.html). The
key will be put to use with the release of Wheezy or the expiry
of the old key 0x473041FA (2018-03-05), whichever comes first.




Paul Tagliamonte sent
[another
update](http://blog.pault.ag/post/22810143424/gcc-4-7-patchathon-part-v) on his
[GCC 4.7
patchathon](http://blog.pault.ag/post/21083720029/gcc-4-7-patchathon): since 14 April he has already sent 28 patches to fix
gcc-4.7 FTBFS bugs. Well done,
Paul!




Cyril Brulebois sent [some](http://blog.mraw.org/2012/05/01/DXN-11/) [updates](http://blog.mraw.org/2012/05/07/DXN-12/) on Debian
X server development.




Thanks to an
[upstream
licence change](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2012-04/msg00041.html),
[autoconf-doc](https://packages.debian.org/sid/autoconf-doc) is now
part of Debian main.




Based on a
[recent
study looking at insecure libraries](https://www.aspectsecurity.com/uploads/downloads/2012/03/Aspect-Security-The-Unfortunate-Reality-of-Insecure-Libraries.pdf), Thomas Koch suggested that it makes
[sense
to package Java libraries](https://lists.debian.org/debian-java/2012/05/msg00008.html) in Debian, thanks to its strict and rigorous
security policy.




Andreas B. Mundt presented the
[Debian
Local Area Network project (Debian-LAN)](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2012/04/msg00178.html): its goal is to make setting up
a local network with centralised user and machine management, intranet, etc.
as easy as possible in Debian. More information is available on the
[wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianLAN/).
