Update for Debian 6.0: 6.0.6 released
-------------------------------------



The sixth [update for
Debian 6.0 (codenamed Squeeze)](https://www.debian.org/News/2012/20120929) has been released. This update
mainly adds corrections of security problems to the stable release,
along with some adjustments for serious problems.



Reports from the latest BSPs
----------------------------



The [bug
squashing party held in Dublin](http://beta.howtorecognise.mine.nu/blog/Dublin_BSP.html) on Saturday, 8 September
was hosted in Google office space and gathered 15 people.
In addition to its impact on the Release-Critical bugs list it triggered
the bootstrapping of a local Debian community with the desire to
hold a second such party in October.




The following weekend, another
[bug
squashing party held in Berlin](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2012/09/msg00008.html) gathered approximately 25 people who also
worked on German translations besides dealing with Release-Critical bugs.



Results from Debian's Google Summer of Code
-------------------------------------------



Ana Guerrero sent a
[report
about Debian's Google Summer of Code](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/09/msg00011.html). Debian has been participating in the
Google Summer of Code since 2006, and sponsored 15 projects this year, of which 12
finished successfully.
Students supervised by Debian mentors worked on various aspects of the
project, including improvements to mentors.debian.net, the development
of multi-arch cross-toolchains, and metrics for team activities, to
name just three. Some of these results have already been included into Debian.
The Debian project thanks those who took part, including especially the
students for their contributions, and invites them to continue being involved
in making Debian better.



Mini DebConf in Paris
---------------------



Sylvestre Ledru, on the behalf of the
[organisation team](http://france.debian.net/), announced that
the [second
Mini DebConf in Paris](http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Miniconf-Paris/2012) will take place on 24 and 25Â November
and will be hosted by [EPITA](http://epita.fr/). His
[message](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/09/msg00009.html)
mentions that a BSP will be in progress through the entire event,
and that they're currently soliciting talks for the event.



Interviews
----------


There has been a
[Debian Edu interview](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/tags/intervju/) with
[Giorgio Pioda](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Edu_interview__Giorgio_Pioda.html)
who describes, among other things, how he got involved in Debian Edu and his views about it.



Other news
----------



Since the [CIA service](http://cia.vc/) for
monitoring VCS repositories via IRC is now dead, MartÃ­n Ferrari
[proposed
KGB](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2012/09/msg00057.html) as a replacement.




Ansgar Burchardt, on behalf of the FTP team, announced some
[changes
to the Debian Maintainer upload permissions system](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/09/msg00008.html). The new interface replaces
the old DMUA field, which will stop working on 24Â NovemberÂ 2012.

Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [Bugs Search interface of the Ultimate Debian Database](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi), the upcoming release, Debian Wheezy, is currently affected by 480 Release-Critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about 266 Release-Critical bugs remain to be solved for the release to happen.


There are also some [hints on how to interpret](https://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats) these numbers.
