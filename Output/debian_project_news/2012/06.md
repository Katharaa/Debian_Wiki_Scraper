Debian Project Leader Elections 2012: the candidates
----------------------------------------------------



On 2 March, Kurt Roeckx, current Debian Project Secretary, sent the
[call
for nominations](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/03/msg00001.html) for the 2012 Debian Project Leader elections.
Unlike last year, when Stefano Zacchiroli was the only candidate, this year three candidates
will be running for DPL: Wouter Verhelst, Gergely Nagy and the current DPL Stefano Zacchiroli.
  

The campaigning period has already started and will end on 31 March: the
[candidates' platforms](https://www.debian.org/vote/2012/vote_001)
are already available.
You can follow the campaign on the
[debian-vote mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/), where
the prospective leaders reply to voters' questions.
The voting period will start on 1 April and end on 14 April.



First Squeeze-based Debian Edu released
---------------------------------------



The first Squeeze-based version of Debian Edu was
[released](https://www.debian.org/News/2012/20120311)
last week.
Debian Edu (aka Skolelinux) is a Debian Pure
Blend specifically targeted at schools and other educational institutions,
and provides a completely configured school network environment out of
the box.
  

Petter Reinholdtsen started a series of blogposts dedicated to Debian Edu
/ Skolelinux, which will include
[interviews
with Debian Edu users and administrators](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Edu_interview__Nigel_Barker.html) and
[explanations of the team's workflows](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Writing_and_translating_documentation_in_Debian_Edu.html).



Updated Debian 5.0: 5.0.10 released
-----------------------------------



The Debian project is pleased to announce [the
tenth and final update of its oldstable distribution, Debian 5.0
(codename Lenny)](https://www.debian.org/News/2012/20120310). This update mainly adds corrections
for security problems to the oldstable release, along with a few
adjustments for other serious problems. Security advisories
were already published separately and are referenced where available.



Reports from recent Bug Squashing Parties
-----------------------------------------



Jonathan Wiltshire sent a
[report
from the Bug Squashing Party](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2012/03/msg00004.html) held over the weekend of 2–4 March in Cambridge.
The BSP was a success: eighteen developers and contributors worked on 170
bugs, closing 45 bugs and adding further information for 16 bugs. Manuel
Montecelo closed the [oldest
bug](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=305992), opened in 2005, while Neil Williams,
[requesting the removal of
opensync and associated packages](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=662079), closed 25 bugs by a single action.
  

Paul Wise reported on
[the
Perth Bug Squashing Party](http://bonedaddy.net/pabs3/log/2012/03/16/perth-bsp-report/) held over the weekend of 10–11 March.
During the weekend about 10 people worked on 12 bugs, focusing on the
release critical bugs highlighted by rc-alert.



Announcing gobby.debian.org
---------------------------



Philipp Kern announced the availability of
[a Gobby
server hosted by Debian](http://debblog.philkern.de/2012/02/gobbydebianorg.html). Gobby is a realtime collaborative editor
which works as a standalone desktop application. To use it, install the
[gobby-0.5
package](https://packages.debian.org/squeeze/gobby-0.5) and then just connect to the server at gobby.debian.org.



The Debian Kernel Team rocks!
-----------------------------



In a recent article, Stefano Zacchiroli pointed out how much
[the
Debian Kernel Team is contributing to upstream](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2012/03/debian_contributions_to_the_linux_kernel/).
Not only can members of the team often be spotted among the most active
contributors to specific Linux releases, but they were
[also publicly
thanked by Greg Kroah-Hartman](http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/2.6.32-stable.html), current Linux kernel maintainer for the
-stable branch, with these words:
I would personally like to thank the Debian kernel developers,
specifically Ben Hutchings, Maximilian Attems, Dann Frazier, Bastian
Blank, and Moritz Muehlenhoff. They went above and beyond what any
normal developer would have done, ferreting patches out of the
kernel.org releases and the different vendor kernels and bug tracking
systems, backporting them to the 2.6.32 kernel, testing, and then
forwarding them on to me. Their dedication to their user community is
amazing for such a volunteer group of developers.
I firmly believe that without their help, the 2.6.32 kernel would not
have been the success that it was. The users of Red Hat and SuSE products
owe them a great debt.

Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release

According to the [Bugs Search interface of the Ultimate Debian Database](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi), the upcoming release, Debian Wheezy, is currently affected by 573 Release-Critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about 382 Release-Critical bugs remain to be solved for the release to happen.
