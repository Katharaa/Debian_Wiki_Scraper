Debian's presence at RMLL 2012
------------------------------



The yearly Libre Software Meeting, better known
by its French name [Rencontres Mondiales du
Logiciel Libre (RMLL)](http://2012.rmll.info/), took place in Geneva, Switzerland, from 7 to
12 July; Anne Forker
[sent a report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2012/08/msg00041.html)
about the Debian presence there, completing the
[report](http://debianmed.blogspot.de/2012/07/debian-med-bits-report-from-lsm-geneva.html)
by Andreas Tille mentioned in a
[previous issue](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2012/15/#med).
The Debian project was well represented with a booth, four lectures and a
workshop. At the booth, T-shirts, umbrellas, Swiss army knives and other
goodies could be purchased. The booth was also a meeting point for fans and
contributors of Debian, a place to discuss computer issues and for socialisation
between conference attendees.
Some pictures of the event taken by Marc Duck DequÃ¨nes are available on his
[website](https://photos.duckcorp.org/v/users/duck/GeekAttitude/20120707_RMLL/RMLL/).



64-bit PC: primary Debian architecture
--------------------------------------



According to the [Debian Popularity
Contest](https://popcon.debian.org), 64-bit PC is now the primary architecture in terms of number of
submissions via the popularity-contest package, which periodically and
anonymously sends statistics about the usage of installed packages.
With a bit more than 60,000 submissions, 64-bit PC just overtook 32-bit PC. These
leading architectures are followed by armel and powerpc, for which the number of
submissions is several orders of magnitude behind.



New mirrors closer to Debian users
----------------------------------


The Debian mirrors team, together with our sponsors, is happy to announce three
new mirrors: in [Russia](http://ftp.ru.debian.org/debian/), provided
by the [National Research Nuclear University
MEPhI](http://mephi.ru/) whose administrators are pleased to provide a full Debian mirror
to Russian users; in [Vietnam](http://mirror.debian.vn/debian/),
provided by MAYCHU; and in [Malaysia](http://archive.mmu.edu.my/debian/),
provided by the [Multimedia University of Malaysia](http://www.mmu.edu.my/).
For other countries, the [full list of mirrors](https://www.debian.org/mirror/list)
is available online, as well as the [experimental redirector](http://http.debian.net/) which will
automatically take into account these new mirrors.
There are still countries lacking good connectivity to a Debian mirror;
sponsors interested in hosting are invited to [contact the mirrors team](https://www.debian.org/mirror/submit).



Debian translation workflows in a Master's thesis
-------------------------------------------------



Laura Arjona recently defended her
[Master's degree thesis](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2012/06/msg00110.html)
entitled Translations in
libre software. Many aspects of Debian are included,
such as a case study about translation projects and teams in Debian;
another one about The Debian Administration Handbook; and an interview
with Javier Taravilla, a member of the l10n-spanish (Spanish localisation) team.
The more I see of the Debian community, the more I like it and it amazes
me, she said when she announced [her project](https://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-spanish/2012/06/msg00320.html) to the Debian mailing list.
Laura started to contribute to the spam cleaning efforts, and she plans to help
in the l10n-spanish team soon.
The manuscript of her thesis as well as the slides are available from her
[blog](http://larjona.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/presentation-of-my-master-thesis-translations-in-libre-software/).
