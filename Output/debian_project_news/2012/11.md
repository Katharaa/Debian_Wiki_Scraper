Bits from the Release Team
--------------------------



Cyril Brulebois sent some [bits
from the Release Team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/05/msg00004.html). Cyril announced that, although the
exact date has not been determined yet, the freeze of Debian 7.0
Wheezy has been scheduled for the second half of June.
Cyril also asked for help in fixing [the high number of Release-Critical
bugs affecting Wheezy](https://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/other/testing.html).



Removal of Qt3 from Debian
--------------------------



Ana Beatriz Guerrero LÃ³pez blogged about the [removal
of Qt3 from Debian](http://ekaia.org/blog/2012/05/20/long-due-to-do-item-removal-of-qt3-from-debian/): the package was [orphaned](https://bugs.debian.org/625502) a year ago and, as
nobody has volunteered to maintain it, is now a candidate for removal
before the release of Wheezy.
[A wiki page tracking the status of the removal](https://wiki.debian.org/qt3-x11-freeRemoval)
is available.



Report from Debian Utsavam
--------------------------



Praveen Arimbrathodiyil wrote a
[report
from the Debian Utsavam event](http://www.j4v4m4n.in/2012/05/01/debian-utsavam-at-mes-kuttippuram-kerala-2/) that was held at the end of April at MES college
of Engineering in Kuttippuram, India. The two-day event was targeted at
both new and advanced users, with talks on basic command-line usage
as well as workshops on how to create Debian packages.



Interviews
----------



ITWire published an interview with [Stefano
Zacchiroli](http://www.itwire.com/it-people-news/people/54879-how-debian-has-grown-stefano-zacchiroli-speaks-), following his re-election as Debian Project Leader.



Other news
----------



Christian Perrier noted that [14
languages are to be deactivated in the Debian Installer](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2012/05/21#di-deactivation-status-5) and called for
volunteers to help to keep them working.




Christopher Huhn noted that [the
computer infrastructure at GSI uses Debian](https://lists.debian.org/debian-science/2012/05/msg00110.html). GSI is a German
non-profit research lab that runs a heavy ion accelerator: they run
a Debian-based Linux farm with more than 1000 nodes.

Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [Bugs Search interface of the Ultimate Debian Database](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi), the upcoming release, Debian Wheezy, is currently affected by 857 Release-Critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about 500 Release-Critical bugs remain to be solved for the release to happen.


There are also some [hints on how to interpret](https://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats) these numbers.
