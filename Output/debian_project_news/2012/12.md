Debian archive rebuilds on Amazon Web Services
----------------------------------------------



Lucas Nussbaum has been doing some
[full archive rebuilds on
Amazon Web Services (AWS)](http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=718).
Archive rebuilds play an important role in Debian Quality Assurance
and Release Management efforts, according to Lucas, who has been running
Debian archive rebuilds on the
[Gridâ5000
testbed](https://www.grid5000.fr/mediawiki/index.php/Grid5000:Home) since 2007, and has filed over 6000 release-critical bugs in the
process. Lucas managed to get Amazon to
[award
Debian $10,000](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2011/10/msg00056.html) in order to run about 60 full archive rebuilds on
their infrastructure, allowing developers interested in custom tests
to do them themselves.



Debian welcomes diversity
-------------------------



A [diversity statement](https://www.debian.org/intro/diversity) for the Debian
project has been [approved by a large
majority of the project members](https://www.debian.org/vote/2012/vote_002).
The statement explicitly welcomes and encourages participation by everyone.
This statement marks a new stage in the process of welcoming contributors
to our project, said Stefano Zacchiroli, Debian Project Leader.
Community diversity goes hand in hand with community richness.



armhf and s390x on their way to Wheezy
--------------------------------------



Adam D. Barratt, Release Team manager, announced that the
[armhf
and s390x](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/06/msg00003.html) ports are now one step closer to being part of Wheezy: they are now officially being
considered as release architectures.
Adam thanks everyone involved in getting both architectures to this point.



DebConf13 logo contest
----------------------



Luca Capello announced that the
[DebConf13
organisers are seeking logo designs for next year's
DebConf](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2012/06/msg00004.html). Some ideas are already present on the
[DebConf wiki](http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf13/logoIdeas),
but they would like to expand these a bit more in line with
[their vision](http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf13/Vision).
There are only a few days left if you would like to participate:
the deadline for DebConf13 logo submissions is Sunday 17 June.



First bug squashing party in Shanghai
-------------------------------------



Thomas Goirand published a
[report
from the first bug squashing party in Shanghai](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2012/05/msg00038.html). About twenty people
participated, including three Debian members, and twenty-five bugs were fixed.



Bits from the Ruby Team
-----------------------



Antonio Terceiro posted some [bits
from the Ruby Team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/06/msg00001.html) in which he announced that the default Ruby interpreter
for Wheezy would be Ruby 1.9.
Ruby 1.8 will be available in Debian during the Wheezy life cycle, but since
security support from upstream [will
end in the next year](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2011/10/06/plans-for-1-8-7/), it will not be shipped in subsequent major releases.
With this switch, Debian users will benefit from the improvements, especially in performance, that Ruby 1.9 brings over Ruby 1.8.
People who still want to use Ruby 1.8 as the default interpreter may find the
[ruby-switch](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/ruby-switch) or
[rbenv](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/rbenv) packages
useful. More information is available on the
[dedicated wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/Ruby).



Interviews
----------



There have been Debian Edu interviews with
[Ralf
Gesellensetter](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Edu_interview__Ralf_Gesellensetter.html) and
[Mike
Gabriel](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Edu_interview__Mike_Gabriel.html), who both describe, among other things, how
they got involved in Debian Edu and their views about it.

According to the [Bugs Search interface of the Ultimate Debian Database](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi), the upcoming release, Debian Wheezy, is currently affected by 734 Release-Critical bugs.
