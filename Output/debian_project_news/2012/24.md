Record number of participants for Mini DebConf Paris
----------------------------------------------------



The second [Mini
DebConf Paris](http://fr2012.mini.debconf.org/), held over the third weekend of November,
registered a record number of participants for a mini DebConf: more than
a hundred people, including Debian Developers, contributors and enthusiasts
from all over Europe.
The great success of the event was also guaranteed by the [high number of talks
and workshops](http://fr2012.mini.debconf.org/#schedule) held during the two days, most of
them recorded by the amazing DebConf Video team (and soon available on the
[video website](http://video.debian.net)).
Josselin Mouette, one of the founders of the Debian GNOME team, held an
interesting talk titled [Large
deployment of GNOME from the administrator's perspective](http://np237.livejournal.com/33449.html),
consisting of an overview of existing mechanisms for administrating GNOME
systems.
Stefano Zacchiroli, current Debian Project Leader, presented the [debian-cloud
initiative](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/talks/2012/20121125-minidc-cloud.pdf) during the Lightning Talks, while
Lucas Nussbaum explained how to get involved in Debian in his
five-minute [Get
involved - it's not that hard](http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=741) talk.
Ben Hutchings and Maximilian Attems presented [the
work of the Linux kernel team](http://womble.decadent.org.uk/talks/mdcp2012-linux-kernel/), while Cyril Brulebois explained [how
the Debian Installer is created and how it works](http://fr2012.mini.debconf.org/slides/re-discovering-d-i.pdf).
Some talks were dedicated to the community aspects of Debian, such as Roberto
Di Cosmo's
[Free
software and Debian, 20 years after](http://fr2012.mini.debconf.org/slides/free-soft-20-years-after.pdf) and the accurate [analysis
of social interactions on Debian mailing lists](http://fr2012.mini.debconf.org/slides/socio-meter-for-debian.pdf) by Alexandre DelanoÃ«
and Bernard Conein.



Debian on smartphones: a feasibility
analysis
---------------------------------------------



Paul Wise documented how to [install
Debian on smartphones](http://bonedaddy.net/pabs3/log/2012/12/03/debian-mobile/): while this is technically possible, the process
is complicated by the fact that the Linux mainline kernel doesn't run on
many mobile devices and the Debian Linux kernel maintainers prefer not to
include non-mainline patches.
Paul concluded by saying that the procedures I documented above are not a
great way to support mobile devices at all and could break at any moment
anyway. So everyone, please become a kernel developer and help merge all
of the many many versions of Android Linux into Linux mainline so that
you can have your favourite distribution on your devices.
The state of the art of support for running Debian on such devices is
documented on the [Mobile wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/Mobile),
while people interested in helping can join the discussion on the [debian-mobile mailing
list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-mobile/) or simply join the #debian-mobile channel on
irc.debian.org.



Official Debian images on Amazon Web Services
---------------------------------------------



James Bromberger announced
[the
availability of official Debian images on Amazon Web Services](http://blog.james.rcpt.to/2012/12/06/official-debian-images-on-amazon-web-services-ec2/).
Over the last few months, James and others have been working on the creation
of official images to be put on the AWS Marketplace.
After the first contact between Amazon and DPL Stefano Zacchiroli,
a group of Debian Developers and the wider community formed to
generate a set of AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) using
Anders Ingemannâs ec2debian-build-ami script, explained James.
Those who plan to use it can find the relevant documentation on the
[Amazon EC2
Image](https://wiki.debian.org/Cloud/AmazonEC2Image) wiki page,
while the ongoing task of creating and supporting official images is
coordinated via the [debian-cloud mailing
list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cloud).



Reports from latest BSPs
------------------------

Bug Squashing Parties were held in different locations across the world: in [Tokyo,

The Debian Women project finally completed the

Inspired by Nicolas Dandrimont's talk about [The state of
mentors.debian.net: GSoC and beyond](http://fr2012.mini.debconf.org/slides/debexpo.pdf), Lucas Nussbaum noted that [half of the package
maintainers in Debian are not Debian Developers or Debian Maintainers](http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=746).




Zaki Akhmad released [Indonesian subtitles](https://github.com/za/debconf12) for the
video recording of Stefano Zacchiroli's Bits from the DPL talk,
held in Managua, Nicaragua, during DebConf12.
If you want to translate the subtitles to your language, you can fetch
[the
original English subtitles](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2012/debconf12/subtitles/) and follow the [tutorial
