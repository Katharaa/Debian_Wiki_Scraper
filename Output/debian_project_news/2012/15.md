Debian Med team report from LSM
-------------------------------



Andreas Tille wrote a [report
from the Libre Software Meeting 2012](http://debianmed.blogspot.de/2012/07/debian-med-bits-report-from-lsm-geneva.html) recently held in Geneva, where he
was representing the Debian Med team.
Andreas organised a Debian Med packaging workshop during the meeting,
which resulted in the creation of initial packaging, almost ready for the
Debian archive, of Creatools.
Andreas also delivered a talk about the [integration
of VistA into Debian](http://video.rmll.info/videos/integration-of-vista-into-debian/), explaining the need to include hospital
information systems straight into Debian and by doing so open the doors
of hospitals for large scale Debian installations.



DebConf13 Logo Contest: final round voting
------------------------------------------



Luca Capello announced a [final
round of voting for the DebConf13 logo contest](https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2012/07/msg00021.html). The voting period
will end on 1 August at 23:59 (UTC+2h).
You can vote directly on the relevant [DebConf
wiki page](http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf13/LogoIdeas#Second_Round).
DebConf is the annual Debian conference which in 2013 will be held in
Vaumarcus, Switzerland.



Rapsberry Pi + Debian = Raspbian!
---------------------------------



Mike Thompson announced that [Raspbian,
his port of Debian armhf, focused on better support for the
Raspberry Pi](https://lists.debian.org/debian-arm/2012/07/msg00041.html), has just become the [official
recommended Linux distribution for the Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1605).
Raspbian is a complete rebuild of Debian Wheezy armhf for the armv6+vfp
CPU on the Raspberry Pi, explained Mike.
Raspbian is available from the [download
page](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads) of the Raspberry Pi website.
