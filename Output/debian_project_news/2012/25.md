Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Stefano Zacchiroli sent his
[monthly
report of DPL activities for November](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/12/msg00000.html): among other things, he
described recent progress in the [work
of the debian-cloud initiative](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2012/24/#aws), the budget approval process for DebConf13, and
[IRC](http://meetbot.debian.net/debian-dpl/2012/debian-dpl.2012-11-13-18.01.html)
[meetings](http://meetbot.debian.net/debian-dpl/2012/debian-dpl.2012-11-27-18.00.html)
of the DPL helpers, a group of people who have offered to share the load of DPL duties.



Wheezy freeze: reviewers needed for unblock requests
----------------------------------------------------



Niels Thykier, a member of the release team, blogged about the
[progress
of the release process for Wheezy](https://nthykier.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/wheezy-release-progress-december/). Wheezy has now been frozen for
almost six months. More than the total number of RC bugs, it is the number of
RC bugs fixed in unstable but not in Wheezy that worries Niels. This situation
is mainly due to unblock requests that none of the members of the release team has had
time to respond to.
If you want to help with the release, and don't find any RC bugs to fix, you can
review some of the unblock requests, and help to decrease the number that remain unanswered.



Report from Bug Squashing Party in Mechlin
------------------------------------------



Wouter Verhelst published a
[report about
the BSP](http://grep.be/blog/en/computer/debian/bsp) he organized in his company's office in Mechlin, Belgium. A couple
of RC bugs were fixed and progress was made on a few more. Although Wouter regrets that he
was the only Belgian Debian Developer present, he was happy to welcome local newcomers who
had never contributed to Debian before. Because of this and the fun they all had, the
event can be considered to have been a success.

According to the [Bugs Search interface of the Ultimate Debian Database](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi), the upcoming release, Debian Wheezy, is currently affected by 323 Release-Critical bugs.
