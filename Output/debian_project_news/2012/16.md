Debian celebrates its 19th birthday
-----------------------------------



On August 16, the Debian Project celebrated its
[nineteenth birthday](https://www.debian.org/News/2012/20120816)
since Ian Murdock's original
[founding
announcement](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.development/msg/a32d4e2ef3bcdcc6).
  

Debian contributors and users celebrated it all over the globe:
appreciation messages and pictures of the parties can be followed on the
[Thank you Debian](http://thanks.debian.net) website,
maintained this year by Lincoln de Sousa and Marcelo Jorge Vieira.
You can submit your own message directly on the web platform or using the Identi.ca hashtag
#thxdebian.
  

For this occasion, Leandro GÃ³mez created a nice
[birthday
postcard](http://leogg.wordpress.com/2012/08/16/happy-birthday-debian/) while [some](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2012/08/16/happy-birthday-debian-and-memories-of-an-old-timer/)
[other](http://gwolf.org/blog/19-years-debian)
[contributors](http://blog.pault.ag/post/29667512949) blogged
about their first experiences with Debian.



Help the Debian Installer team: test the new version of the installer
---------------------------------------------------------------------



The Debian Installer team
[announced](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/News/2012/20120804)
the first beta release of the installer for Debian 7.0 Wheezy.
The team asks Debian users to help in testing and improving this new
version of the installer: while there are some [known issues](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/errata) with the
installer that do not need to be reported, it is very important to try
the installer in order to find all possible bugs before the release.
  

Problems should be reported as an [installation
report](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch05s04.html#submit-bug).



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Stefano Zacchiroli sent
[his
monthly report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/08/msg00001.html) on DPL activities.
Stefano reported about the ongoing discussion with the FSF about Debian
Freeness, as well as an important discussion about the trademark policy
draft and the logo relicensing.



Other news
----------


The 30th issue of the
[miscellaneous
news for developers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/08/msg00003.html) has been released and covers the following topics:


* Report from DSA Team Sprint
* Using RAM for temporary files?
* Control Commands at submit@bugs.debian.org time
* Debian Maintainer Dashboard
* Declaring media (MIME) types with FreeDesktop menu entry files



Justin B. Rye has started an informational wiki page describing where package names come from,
suggestively entitled ["Why the name"](https://wiki.debian.org/WhyTheName). As the
page description says, giving cryptic names to software is a well-established UNIX tradition,
and the explanations are often missing from the documentation, either because the developers
imagine it's obvious (usually wrongly) or because they think nobody cares (and here they're
usually right, or it would turn up as FAQ material).



Upcoming events
---------------


There is one upcoming Debian-related event:


* August 25-26 Sankt Augustin, Germany —
 [Debian booth at FrOSCon](https://www.debian.org/events/2012/0825-froscon)

Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [Bugs Search interface of the Ultimate Debian Database](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi), the upcoming release, Debian Wheezy, is currently affected by 487 Release-Critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about 295 Release-Critical bugs remain to be solved for the release to happen.


There are also some [hints on how to interpret](https://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats) these numbers.
