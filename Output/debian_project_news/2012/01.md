Debian Edu/Skolelinux 6.0.3 beta2 released
------------------------------------------



Petter Reinholdtsen announced the [release
of Debian Edu Squeeze 6.0.3 beta2](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2012/01/msg00129.html): [download
and installation instructions](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu/Documentation/Squeeze/Installation) are
available on the wiki, and in particular a useful [Getting
Started chapter](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu/Documentation/Squeeze/GettingStarted) in which you can find explanations
of how to log in for the first time.
Feedback and installation reports can be sent to the [Debian Edu mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/).




Debian Edu is a project aiming to make a Debian Pure Blend for educational
purposes, which can be used in schools and other educational
institutions. The Debian Edu project develops and maintains [Skolelinux](http://www.skolelinux.org/), a complete and free out of
the box software solution for schools.
For more information about Debian Edu, please visit the
[related wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu).



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Stefano Zacchiroli sent some [bits
from the DPL](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/01/msg00001.html) in which he reported about the work done by Martin
Michlmayr as Auditor, in order to reconstruct Debian's expenses and
budgets. Stefano also sent a call for help for Wheezy artwork
organisation, and announced that Gunnar Wolf has volunteered to monitor
the discussion regarding the Creative Commons process for revision 4.0
on behalf of Debian.



Forthcoming new release of the X server
---------------------------------------


Cyril Brulebois blogged about the [forthcoming
X server release 1.12](http://blog.mraw.org/2012/01/01/XServer_1.12RC1/): one major change is the addition of
XI2.2 patches, which are related to multitouch support. Another
significant change is the addition of support for Intel's Sandy Bridge New
Acceleration in the Debian packages.


Scientific article on Debian in PNAS
------------------------------------



Michael Hanke [noted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2011/12/msg00000.html)
that the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS) of the United
States of America has a [paper on the evolution of software in Debian](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/11/14/1115960108.abstract).




If you know other studies about Debian and its software, you can add it to our
[related wiki
page](https://wiki.debian.org/CategoryPublication).



New Debian Infographic
----------------------



Claudio Filho has published a beautiful [infographic
about Debian](http://claudiocomputing.wordpress.com/infographic-of-debian/). The main motivation was, [as
Claudio said](https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2011/12/msg00066.html), to "draw" for final users how Debian can be good for
them.
  

Similar efforts have been made by [StÃ©phane Blondon](http://ascendances.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/timeline_debian_1993_20111.png) and
[Chris
Lamb](http://chris-lamb.co.uk/2008/03/09/timeline-of-the-debian-project/), who created the [Debian
Timeline website](http://timeline.debian.net/) and the related [Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/sid/debian-timeline).



New interface for Debtags website
---------------------------------



Enrico Zini announced a [new interface for the Debtags website](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/01/msg00000.html). Debtags is a project to
classify Debian packages by adding tags to them: Debtags attaches
categories (we call them tags) to packages, creating a new set of useful
structured metadata that can be used to implement more advanced ways of
presenting, searching, maintaining and navigating the package
archive, Enrico said [while presenting the project in 2005](http://debtags.alioth.debian.org/paper-debtags.html).
Using the new interface, it is possible to [search packages](https://debtags.debian.org/search/), take a look
at [statistics about
Debtags](https://debtags.debian.org/statistics/) and, obviously, [help with the tagging
effort](https://debtags.debian.org/getting-started/). For more information about Debtags, you can visit the [related wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/Debtags).



apt-get purge defoma
--------------------



Paul Wise reported that [the
transition from defoma to fontconfig is finally complete](http://bonedaddy.net/pabs3/log/2012/01/07/apt-get-purge-defoma/). Defoma is
the Debian-specific font manager, long unmaintained, while the
replacement (fontconfig) is cross-distribution and also has wide support
from upstreams. In the past three years the [Debian Fonts Task Force](http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/)
has worked a lot in order to gain this result, thanks especially to the
work of Christian Perrier and Paul Wise. Please note that the transition
is not completely smooth: Xorg does not yet support fontconfig so for
now programs relying on server-side fonts will only be able to use the
xfonts- packages shipping their fonts in the directories known
by the X server and in addition there are some [issues](https://wiki.debian.org/gs-undefoma) with Ghostscript and
CJK, Paul said.



Further interviews
------------------


Since the last issue of the Debian Project News,
two new issues of the [This week in
 Debian podcast](https://wiki.debian.org/ThisWeekInDebian) have been published: with
[Jonathan Nadeau](http://frostbitemedia.org/node/35),
about the Northeast GNU/Linux Fest; and with
[RaphaÃ«l Hertzog](http://frostbitemedia.org/node/31),
about the Debian handbook.



There has also been a
 People behind Debian interview with
[Ben
Hutchings](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/12/13/people-behind-debian-ben-hutchings-member-of-the-kernel-team/), member of the kernel team.




In addition the [NeuroDebian team](http://neuro.debian.net/) was
[interviewed](http://incf.org/newsroom/stories/neurodebian-the-value-of-an-integrated-tool-suite)
by the INCF.



Other news
----------


The 27th issue of the
[miscellaneous news for developers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/12/msg00001.html)
has been released and covers the following topics:


* Planet Debian Derivatives
* win32-loader.exe now eases access to the GNU/Hurd Debian-Installer
* Wiki bugstatus extended to Launchpad bugs
* dh-exec entering unstable
* derivatives patch generation prototype


Uwe Hermann published a useful [quick
howto on using OpenVPN on Debian GNU/Linux](http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/howto-using-openvpn-on-debian-gnu-linux).



Jonas Smedegaard reported that [the
Indonesian newspaper Serambi dedicated an article to his
Debian involvement](http://aceh.tribunnews.com/2011/12/11/ayo-jadi-hacker) after his presence at a radio talkshow in Aceh,
Indonesia. Jonas was travelling Asia in order to deliver a series of talks
dedicated to [Debian Pure Blends](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianPureBlends).
More information about his trip are available on a related [wiki page](http://wiki.jones.dk/DebianAsia2011).




The web team is pleased to announce that [all
languages have finished their migration to UTF-8](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=567781), so the [Debian website](https://www.debian.org/) is now available for everyone
in UTF-8, thanks to all the translators who worked on this issue.




Asheesh Laroia wrote an [interesting
article about short key IDs with OpenPGP and GNU Privacy Guard](http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/short-key-ids-are-bad-news.html),
arguing that using them is fundamentally insecure as it's easy to
generate collisions for short key IDs.



The Debian Project was mentioned in an article by Bruce Byfield on
Datamation titled [2011:
The Year of Linux Disappointments](http://www.datamation.com/open-source/2011-the-year-of-linux-disappointments-1.html). According to the author, in
fact, while various Open Source projects saw a decline in 2011, the
Debian project spent much of 2011 reinventing itself. In the past few
twelve months, it has âÂ among other thingsÂ â tried to encourage
cooperation among its derivatives, revamped its new member process, and
experimented with IRC training sessions.




Martin Zobel-Helas announced that [he has
applied the main theme of Debian website to db.debian.org, the
internal LDAP directory of Debian Developers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2012/01/msg00040.html). In the previous days, thanks
to Cristoph Berg, the [Debian Quality
Assurance website](https://qa.debian.org/) had also switched to the main theme.




Russ Allbery wrote an [interesting blog post](http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/journal/2012-01/004.html) about Debian and popularity.

Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [Bugs Search
 interface of the Ultimate Debian Database](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi), the upcoming release,
 Debian 7.0 Wheezy, is currently affected by
797 release-critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved
 or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about
532 release-critical bugs remain to be solved for the
 release to happen.


There are also [more detailed
 statistics](http://blog.schmehl.info/Debian/rc-stats/7.0-wheezy/2012-01) as well as some [hints on how to
 interpret](https://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats) these numbers.


Status of Debian Installer localisation
---------------------------------------



In his last report on [Debian Installer localisation](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2012/01/05#di-l10n-update-2012-03), Christian Perrier noted that
eighteen languages are currently up to date for D-I's core files;
ten (Czech, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Kazakh, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian and Slovak)
are 100% complete for the moment.




Christian informed us [previously](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2012/01/02#di-l10n-update-2012-02)
that A very important and critical fix to
partman-zfs broke a string in sublevel 4.
That explains why the results are lower than the [last time](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2011/14/#di) we relayed the
translation status, but translators are quickly working to make
the Debian Installer completely available in many languages.
