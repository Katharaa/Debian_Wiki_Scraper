Debian project leader elected
-----------------------------



The Debian project has just reelected [Stefano Zacchiroli
for a third year as Debian Project Leader](https://www.debian.org/News/2012/20120415). More than 80% of voters
put him as their first choice (or equal first) on their ballot papers.




Stefano's large majority over his opponents shows how satisfied the Debian project is
with his work so far, and its wish for him to represent the project during one last
term â Stefano has already announced he won't be seeking reelection again next year.
Wouter Verhelst and Gergely Nagy also gained a lot of support from
Debian project members, both coming hundreds of votes ahead of the
"None of the above" ballot choice.



Registration open for DebConf12
-------------------------------



The Debian project is pleased to announce that
[registration is now open for the
DebConf12](https://www.debian.org/News/2012/20120412) conference, which will take place in Managua, Nicaragua, from Sunday 8
July to Saturday 14 July 2012.
The conference will be preceded as usual by a week-long DebCamp, from
Sunday 1 July to Saturday 7 July.
It will only be possible to apply for food and accommodation grants
and/or travel grants until 15 May.




Debian also invites
[submissions
of proposals](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/04/msg00002.html) for papers, presentations, discussion sessions
and tutorials for DebConf12 until 1 June 2012.



Personal BSP initiatives
------------------------



We usually give information about BSPs where a group of people meet over a weekend,
but today we'd like to mention two personal initiatives. Gregor Herrmann has reported
[every](http://info.comodo.priv.at/blog/archives/2012/04/#e2012-04-08T21_24_42.txt)
[week](http://info.comodo.priv.at/blog/archives/2012/04/#e2012-04-01T17_50_17.txt)
[over](http://info.comodo.priv.at/blog/archives/2012/03/#e2012-03-25T20_46_42.txt)
[ten](http://info.comodo.priv.at/blog/archives/2012/03/#e2012-03-18T14_31_19.txt)
Release-Critical bugs squashed.
Gerfried Fuchs also regularly reports on stable Release-Critical bugs
squashed, and has managed to squash
[over](http://rhonda.deb.at/blog/2012/04/02#squeeze-RCs-2012-3)
[thirty](http://rhonda.deb.at/blog/2012/02/08#squeeze-RCs-2012-2)
[bugs](http://rhonda.deb.at/blog/2012/01/19#squeeze-RCs-2012-1)
each month.
We would like to thank Gregor Herrmann, Gerfried Fuchs and all other RC
bug addicts who are constantly helping to make our distribution better.



The state of Debian s390x
-------------------------



Philipp Kern posted an update on the [current
state of the Debian s390x port](http://debblog.philkern.de/2012/04/state-of-debian-s390x.html). Work started on this port [last summer, during
DebConf11](http://blog.aurel32.net/59), and in less than a month it already had almost 65% of
packages built. Unfortunately, a new GLib release created some problems
on this architecture; but recently a [new
major release of GLib](https://packages.qa.debian.org/g/glib2.0/news/20120330T073522Z.html) fixed all the issues. The next steps for
this port will be to fix [open
bugs](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=s390x;users=debian-s390@lists.debian.org) and to make Iceweasel build successfully.



Interviews
----------


RaphaÃ«l Hertzog published a People behind Debian interview with
[Francesca
Ciceri](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2012/04/06/people-behind-debian-francesca-ciceri-member-of-debian-press-publicity-teams/), a member of the Debian press and publicity teams, while
Petter Reinholdtsen interviewed
[Wolfgang
Schweer](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Edu_interview__Wolfgang_Schweer.html),
[Justin
B Rye](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Edu_interview__Justin_B__Rye.html) and
[Andreas
Mundt](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Edu_interview__Andreas_Mundt.html) for his Debian Edu interviews series.



Other news
----------


Guido GÃ¼nther sent out some
[bits
from the fifth Debian Groupware Meeting](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/04/msg00000.html),
which was held at the Linux Hotel in Essen, Germany.
During the weekend the group fixed various issues and was able to
push new versions of [icedove](https://packages.debian.org/icedove)
and [d-push](https://packages.debian.org/d-push) to unstable
while [iceowl](https://packages.debian.org/iceowl) (dead upstream)
remains in experimental.
Some work was also done on OpenChange, Zarafa ZCP and SOGo, and several
[evolution
bugs](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=evolution;dist=unstable) were worked on.




Michael Larabel did some benchmarks [to compare
Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, Debian GNU/Linux and FreeBSD/PC-BSD
9.0](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTA4NTY) on a dual AMD Opteron 2384 system with 4 GB
of RAM and a 160 GB Western Digital SATA drive.
It appears that Linux is generally
faster than kFreeBSD for now, but kFreeBSD won on a few tests.
For more details, you can
consult the [complete results page](http://openbenchmarking.org/result/1202215-BY-FREEBSD9683).




Sebastian Harl called for
[help
with handling the Debian booth](https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2012/04/msg00000.html) at the Grazer Linuxtage.
If you are interested in helping out, please add yourself to
the [wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/de/2012/GLT).




MÃ²nica RamÃ­rez Arceda wrote a useful [tutorial
for new Debian Developers](http://dunetna.probeta.net/doku.php/debian:non-dd_to_dd_steps) where she explained the
useful configuration changes people may want to apply just after
they become DDs.

Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [Bugs Search interface of the Ultimate Debian Database](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi), the upcoming release, Debian Wheezy, is currently affected by 726 Release-Critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about 517 Release-Critical bugs remain to be solved for the release to happen.


There are also some [hints on how to interpret](https://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats) these numbers.
