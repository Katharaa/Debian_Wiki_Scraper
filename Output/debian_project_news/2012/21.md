Debian Installer 7.0 Beta3 released
-----------------------------------



Cyril Brulebois
[announced
the third beta release of the Debian Installer 7.0](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/News/2012/20121018).
One of the major improvements in this version of the Debian Installer is
EFI support for 64-bit PCs, which allows installation in EFI mode
instead of using the legacy BIOS. This is a first step towards
full support for UEFI Secure Boot, which is not yet present.
Another interesting new feature in the installer is full IPv6 support
during the installation process.
You can check the
[errata](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/errata) for
details and a full list of known issues.



Reports from the latest BSPs
----------------------------



Jonathan Wiltshire sent a [report
from the Alcester BSP](https://lists.debian.org/334dc3a99b55eb8fe8e299dd04b5d28c@hogwarts.powdarrmonkey.net) held between 12 and 14 October.
During the party, six Debian Developers and one Debian contributor
worked on a total of 51 bugs.
  

During the same weekend, Dutch Debian developers and enthusiasts [gathered
in Utrecht for another Bug Squashing Party](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2012/10/msg00312.html): they worked on several RC
bugs as well as debconf translations.



Other news
----------



Arno TÃ¶ll, mentors.debian.net maintainer, drafted an initial
[proposal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2012/09/msg00654.html)
last month for a simple procedure for salvaging unmaintained packages.
After some discussion, Lucas Nussbaum, QA team member, put forward an
[updated proposal](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2012/10/msg00469.html)
for allowing contributors to orphan an unmaintained package, and make it easy
to adopt the package after this first step.
While the discussion is still ongoing, Stefano Zacchiroli, Debian Project Leader, is
confident that a
[consensus](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2012/10/msg00575.html)
will emerge from it.




Raphael Geissert created a
[nice
map of the Debian mirror network](http://rgeissert.blogspot.it/2012/10/debian-mirrors-map.html).

[birth of the Ireland Debian User Group (DUG)](https://lists.debian.org/CAL60Pd9QbdK24T-3D135fDWQAQn9iPV+Y=_5QWtjx2LB6kEoNA@mail.gmail.com): for more information
you can contact [the
group mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-dug-ie/).
