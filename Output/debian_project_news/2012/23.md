Help your language reach 100% support in
the Debian Installer
-------------------------------------------------------------



Christian Perrier recently sent a [message
to the Debian translators mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2012/11/msg00036.html) looking for people
interested in translating the Debian installer into the following
languages: Lithuanian, Bosnian, Tamil, Lao, Hungarian, Icelandic, Macedonian,
Dzongkha, Nepali, Norwegian Nynorsk, Albanian, Amharic, Kurdish, Tagalog,
Wolof (which is currently disabled because too many important strings are
missing) and Tibetan. These languages are almost complete, but the
regular contributors have not responded to the usual calls. Currently 55
out of 70 supported languages have reached 100% completion, the highest
number ever.



Debian Installer 7.0 Beta4 released
-----------------------------------



Cyril Brulebois [announced
the fourth beta release of the installer for Debian 7.0](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/News/2012/20121122). This release
features, among other things, many updates to the Linux kernel as well as
some major improvements in the netcfg package, which is the tool used to
configure the network during the installation. As usual, the Debian
Installer team asks users to test this new release: installer
CDs, other media and everything you might need to install Debian on one of the
thirteen architectures supported are available from the
[web site](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/).



Debian newcomer experience survey
---------------------------------



Kevin Carillo, a PhD student from Wellington, New Zealand, is [currently
doing research about Free/Open Source Software communities](https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2012/11/msg00014.html): if you are a
Debian contributor who started work in Debian after January 2010, you should
consider participating in his
[online
survey](https://limesurvey.sim.vuw.ac.nz/index.php?sid=65151&lang=en). You can find more information about Kevin's research on
[his website](http://kevincarillo.org/).

with
[Angela
FuÃ](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Edu_interview__Angela_Fu_.html),
who describes, among other things, how she got involved in Debian Edu and
her views about it.

Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [Bugs Search interface of the Ultimate Debian Database](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi), the upcoming release, Debian Wheezy, is currently affected by 366 Release-Critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about 175 Release-Critical bugs remain to be solved for the release to happen.


There are also [more detailed statistics](http://richardhartmann.de/blog/posts/2012/11/24-Debian_Release_Critical_Bug_report_for_Week_47/) as well as some [hints on how to interpret](https://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats) these numbers.



These figures were current as of last Saturday.
