Deploy your own cloud with Debian
Wheezy
----------------------------------------



The Debian Project
[has announced the
availability, for its testing distribution, of some packages to create
a private cloud](https://www.debian.org/News/2012/20120425): among others,
[xcp-xapi](https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/xcp-xapi)
and [nova-xcp-plugins](https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/nova-xcp-plugins).
Preserving user freedoms in the cloud is a tricky business and one of
the major challenges ahead for Free Software. By easing the deployment of
Debian-based private clouds we want to help our users in resisting the
lure of giving up their freedoms in exchange of some flexibility,
said Stefano Zacchiroli, Debian Project Leader.



Debian Tour in Nicaragua
------------------------



The Debian Nicaraguan community is organising the
[Debian Tour](http://linuxtour.org/Debian_tour): from April to
June, members of the local Debian community will deliver talks in several
universities in Nicaragua, helping students to learn
about the Debian Project and Free Software in general.
The tour started in the city of Masaya, and will touch other cities such as
Managua and LeÃ³n.
On May 5th, Debian Tour will take place at UCA (the future DebConf12 venue)
and special visitors, the Debian Developers and DebConf chairs, Gunnar Wolf
and Holger Levsen, will attend this time.



Debian at ESRF
--------------



JÃ©rÃ´me Kieffer noticed that
[the
European Synchrotron in Grenoble](https://lists.debian.org/debian-science/2012/04/msg00044.html) is migrating its computing
infrastructure to Debian: the computer controlling the
particle accelerator has already been migrated, as well as some data
analysis servers and part of the computer cluster.
The [European Synchrotron Radiation
Facility](http://www.esrf.eu) (ESRF) is a joint facility supported and shared by
various European countries which operates the most powerful synchrotron
radiation source in Europe.
For data analysis Debian offers both the richest environment including
the most used software and libraries in our field of research, and a rock
solid distribution with security fixes, added JÃ©rÃ´me in
[another
mail](https://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2012/04/msg00157.html).



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Stefano Zacchiroli sent his [monthly
report on DPL activities](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/04/msg00006.html). During the last month, Stefano informed the
project about
[a
proposal for a revenue sharing agreement from DuckDuckGo](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2012/03/msg00092.html), marked
[DEP-5](https://dep-team.pages.debian.net/deps/dep5/) as accepted, and worked
with Kenshi Muto to transfer the ownership of the Debian trademark in
Japan to SPI.
Stefano also gave
[an
interview about Debian and Free Software in general](http://www.repubblica.it/tecnologia/2012/03/26/news/intervista_debian-30986031/) (in Italian)
to one of the major newspapers in Italy, La Repubblica. Thanks to Matteo
Cortese, who translated it, an
[English
version](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2012/03/intervista_per_la_Repubblica/en/) of the interview is also available.



Interviews
----------



RaphaÃ«l Hertzog published a People behind Debian interview with
[Samuel
Thibault](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2012/04/19/people-behind-debian-samuel-thibault-working-on-accessibility-and-the-hurd/), member of the accessibility and Hurd teams.



Other news
----------



Vincent Bernat wrote a tutorial on [how
to install XBMC on Debian Wheezy](http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2012-xbmc-debian-wheezy.html).
[XBMC](https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/xbmc) is a media
centre supporting a wide range of digital media and remote controls,
which âÂ thanks to the hard work of Andres MejiaÂ â has recently been
[accepted
into Debian](http://xbmc.org/theuni/2012/04/10/xbmc-accepted-into-debian/).

Ben Hutchings, member of the Debian Kernel Team, announced that
[he will

place of Greg Kroah-Hartman](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1284809/focus%3D1285786). Last January, Ben announced that
Debian Wheezy [will
use Linux 3.2](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/01/msg00012.html).




Paul Wise noticed that
[two
Debian derivatives shut down](http://bonedaddy.net/pabs3/log/2012/04/26/when-a-distro-dies/) in the last two months.
Thanks to the [derivatives
census](https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census), some
[patches](http://dex.alioth.debian.org/census/Vanillux/patches/)
are still available and he provided an analysis of them.




Ana Guerrero announced that
[fifteen
Debian projects have been selected for the Google Summer of Code 2012](http://ekaia.org/blog/2012/04/27/debian-in-the-google-summer-of-code-2012/),
which is six more projects than last year.
