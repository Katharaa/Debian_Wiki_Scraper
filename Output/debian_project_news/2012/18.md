Bits from the FTP Team
----------------------



Joerg Jaspert sent some [bits
from the FTP Team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/09/msg00001.html), announcing the ongoing sprint
during which the team is working on optimising the current code behind
the main archive, finalising a proposal for Debian Personal
Package Archives (PPAs), and merging backports.debian.org into the main
archive host.
This year, participation in the Google Summer of Code initiative
helped the team in implementing a true multi-archive capability, making
it possible to merge separated parts of the Debian archive (like security
and backports) into the main archive.
Joerg also added a call for volunteers: if you are a Debian Developer and
want to help one of the key teams of the Debian infrastructure, please
consider joining them.



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Stefano Zacchiroli sent his usual [monthly
report of DPL activities](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/09/msg00002.html): during August, Stefano continued his
efforts on a new trademark policy and on the DFSG-free logo relicensing
(with the help of members of the Software Freedom Law Center).
