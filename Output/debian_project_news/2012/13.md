DebConf11 financial report
--------------------------



Richard Darst posted a
[financial
report for DebConf11](https://lists.debian.org/20120609232849.GD10733@boltzmann.zgib.net).
Approximate numbers had been known since last year, but Richard
checked all transactions against SPI and FFIS records to confirm
that, thanks to the support of the Republika Srpska government,
the conference generated a surplus for Debian of around â¬20,000.
This surplus is expected to be reinvested in future DebConf costs.



Countdown to the freeze
-----------------------



Neil McGovern, on behalf of the Release Team, announced that the
[freeze
will start on 30 June](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/06/msg00006.html).
That means that no new packages, and no new versions, will automatically migrate to testing
after that point.
Developers can then focus on fixing the last release critical issues in order
to offer everyone a best quality Wheezy stable release once it's ready.



Debian mirror redirector
------------------------



Raphael Geissert widely announced a new
[mirror
redirector service](http://rgeissert.blogspot.fr/2012/06/introducing-httpdebiannet-debians.html),
[http.debian.net](http://http.debian.net/), that aims to reduce
the impact of occasionally offline or out-of-date mirrors,
and to use the worldwide network of mirrors more effectively.
For now this service is unofficial, though Raphael hopes that it might
be used as default in future.
You're welcome to test and use the service by following the
[instructions on its website](http://http.debian.net/), and send feedback to
[Raphael](mailto:geissert@debian.org).



Internationalisation sprint
---------------------------



Christian Perrier sent a
[report
from the internationalisation (or i18n) sprint](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2012/06/msg00079.html)
that was hosted by [IRILL](http://www.irill.org/) in Paris last weekend.
Seven people attended the meeting, mainly in order to move some
previously unofficial services onto Debian infrastructure,
including the package description translation system.
It was a success â new servers were configured during the sprint, and the actual
services are now migrating to them.



Salzburg bug squashing party
----------------------------



Bernd Zeimetz published a
[report
from the Salzburg bug squashing party](http://bzed.de//posts/2012/06/Report_from_the_Bug_Squashing_Party_in_Salzburg/) that was hosted by
[conova communications GmbH](http://www.conova.com/)
last weekend.
Fifteen to seventeen people from five countries were present,
mainly working on release critical bugs in testing and unstable.
About 68 bugs in unstable and testing were
triaged, patched, fixed, or at least pinged.



Presentation in Romania
-----------------------



Victor NiÈu gave a presentation on the Debian Project, its philosophy and
achievements, and the global and Romanian communities:
[A universal project,
with a global community](https://wiki.debian.org/Presentations#A2012).
This is the first local Debian event in Romania after a year and a half of online presence.
[FundaÈia Ceata](http://ceata.org/), a local Free Software
and Free Culture organisation, supported the community by providing the event
location, the after-party, and the new domain name,
[debian.org.ro](https://www.debian.org.ro/).



Bits from the DPL
-----------------



Stefano Zacchiroli sent
[his
monthly report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/06/msg00005.html) on DPL activities.
May saw the
[first
IRC meeting of the Technical Committee](https://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte/2012/05/msg00072.html), and they plan to set up a
monthly pattern for these meetings, continuing in June.
He mentioned his (failed)
[attempt
to reach an agreement with the debian-multimedia.org archive maintainers](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-multimedia-maintainers/2012-May/026678.html),
and the ongoing
[Debian
for Scientific Facilities Days](http://www.esrf.eu/events/conferences/debian-for-scientific-facilities-days-1/) conference that is also hosting a
[Debian
Science Sprint](https://wiki.debian.org/Sprints/2012/ScienceSprint).
Three people replied to his call for help with DPL tasks, and a
calendar of periodic IRC public meetings will be published soon.
There's still time to apply if you are interested.

[availability
of a new service](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2012/06/msg00017.html), [DUCK â the Debian URL

According to the [Bugs Search interface of the Ultimate Debian Database](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi), the upcoming release, Debian Wheezy, is currently affected by 582 Release-Critical bugs.
