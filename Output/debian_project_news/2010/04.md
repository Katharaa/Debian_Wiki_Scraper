Bits from the Debian Project Leader
-----------------------------------


Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli sent a [Bits
from...](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/05/msg00008.html) mail reporting some of his recent activities. He started
with a call to help Debian's Release Team as the current members need more help
getting the upcoming release of Debian 6.0 Squeeze ready.
He also mentioned some interviews and public appearances he had, and
delegations of the Debian System Administrators and a Debian Auditor. In
a summary of his report of his recent visit to the Ubuntu Developer Summit,
he asked for volunteers to act as the contact point for Debian derivatives.
Their job would be to help developers of Debian derivatives to find ways to
contribute back to Debian.


Parallel booting enabled by default
-----------------------------------


Debian Developer Petter Reinholdtsen [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/05/msg00009.html)
that after enabling reordering the init scripts of a boot sequence back in
last July, parallel booting is now also enabled by default in recent
installations, which should help to reduce boot and shutdown times of new
Debian systems. There is still some work [left
to do](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Parallellized_boot_seem_to_hold_up_well_in_Debian_testing.html) which would further improve shutdown speed of Debian systems, such
as reducing the number of scripts that just kill a daemon during shutdown.


DebConf Reconfirmation Deadline
-------------------------------


DebConf organiser Pablo Duboue [asked](http://lists.debconf.org/lurker/message/20100525.175712.4b6eb245.en.html)
all attendees of the [2010
Debian Developer Conference](https://debconf10.debconf.org/) to reconfirm before 10 June 2010
that they still plan to attend the conference. Reconfirmation can be done
using the [Conference Organisation Web
Interface](http://penta.debconf.org/). Reconfirmation is especially important for people who
requested sponsored food and/or accommodation.


Declassification of the debian-private mailing list
---------------------------------------------------


Over four years ago the Debian Project [decided](https://www.debian.org/vote/2005/vote_002) to open up the
archive of its private mailing list for everyone after a period of
three years. With this three year period being over for the first posts,
Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli [is now
looking](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2010/05/msg00105.html) for volunteers to look through the archive, contact authors of
these mails and open the archive. Martin Krafft [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2010/05/msg00106.html)
to change the workflow, by making parts of the archive open on a regular basis
and letting people delete mails they don't want to see published. Several
problems were pointed out with this approach, such as that people might have resigned as Developers
in the past three years and therefore no longer have enough access to delete their mails.


LILO about to be removed in Debian 6.0 Squeeze
----------------------------------------------


William Pitcock [explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2010/05/msg00769.html)
that due to some limitations (for example in the size of supported kernels) the boot
loader [LILO](https://packages.debian.org/lilo) is about to be removed
from the upcoming release of Debian 6.0 Squeeze. He therefore asked
users to test the replacement boot loader [GRUB 2](https://packages.debian.org/grub-pc).


Firmware support in Debian's installation system
------------------------------------------------


Debian Developer Petter Reinholdtsen [announced](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/More_flexible_firmware_handling_in_debian_installer.html)
some changes he is introducing into Debian's installation system to allow more
flexible handling of the loading of firmware files (binary programs loaded and
executed in hardware, for example some network adaptors). Steve McIntyre, leader of
the Debian CD/DVD team, has already [adapted](https://lists.debian.org/20100527141708.GA27043@einval.com)
the build system for CD/DVD images to reflect these changes and created some [test
images](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/daily-builds/sid_d-i/20100527-7/).


Other news
----------


Ana Guerrero [noticed](https://lists.debian.org/20100522130720.GA1982@ana.debian.net)
that quite a few of the recent Non-Maintainer Uploads are quite intrusive
and reminded NMUers to keep changes minimal.


After visiting the Électricité de France Research and Development centre, Debian
Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli [blogged](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2010/05/Debian-based_scientific_computing_at_EDF/)
about their reasons for basing their cluster (and an increasing number of desktops,
too) on Debian. One of their main reasons was the large amount of scientific
software available as packages and the high quality standards Debian sets.


Aurélien Jarno [reported](http://blog.aurel32.net/?p=56) a bit
about Debian's switch from GLIBC to EGLIBC.


Debian System Administrator Martin Zobel-Helas [announced](https://dsa.debian.org//dsablog/2010/05/Dropping_security.geo.debian.org_zone/)
that with the successful introduction of a GeoDNS setup, the experimental subzone
security.geo.debian.org is obsolete and should be replaced by the normal
security.debian.org entry in /etc/apt/sources.list files.


Roland Mas [blogged](http://roland.entierement.nu/blog/2010/05/23/fusionforge-news-may-2010.html)
bits of news from the FusionForge project, the software running [Debian's collaboration platform](https://alioth.debian.org).


While a similar list for Debian Developers already existed for some time, it
was [reported](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2010/05/debian_maintainers_list/)
that Enrico Zini has just finished the code to produce a [list of Debian Maintainers and their
packages](https://nm.debian.org/dm_list.html).


After wondering what distribution specific tools Debian's KDE might miss,
Sune Vuorela [reported](http://pusling.com/blog/?p=167) some
of the feedback he got. To quote him: All in all, it looks like we are
quite far already. We just need to get the last bits put together.


Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [unofficial
RC-bugs count](http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php), the upcoming release, Debian 6.0
Squeeze, is currently affected by 395 release critical bugs. 66 of them
have already been fixed in Debian's unstable branch. Of the remaining
329 release critical bugs, 44 already have a patch (which might need
testing) and 27 are marked as pending.


Ignoring these bugs as well as release critical bugs for packages in
contrib or non-free, 199 release critical bugs remain to be solved for the
release to happen.


Important Debian Security Advisories
------------------------------------


Debian's Security Team recently released advisories for these packages
(among others):
[phpgroupware](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2046),
[dvipng](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2048),
