New Debian Project Leader
-------------------------


The New Debian Project Leader is named Stefano Zacchiroli (IRC nick
zack). Stefano has already posted an [email](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/04/msg00011.html) to the Debian Developers
Announce mailing list giving out a big thank you, updating his progress
in understanding the DPL's job, and letting people know how they can get
in touch with him. Stefano hopes to be a 'facilitator' and asks that
developers get in touch with him to let him know about 'blockers' that
stand in the way of getting work done. We're a very nice do-ocracy, and
there is no reason why enthusiastic and capable people willing to work
on a specific subject should not be empowered to do so.




While he's on IRC (irc.debian.org) Stefano states the preferred way of
getting in touch with him is via [leader@debian.org](mailto:leader@debian.org). He finishes his
email with; Now let's go and squash some RC bug, Squeeze is getting
closer and closer, and I've already wasted enough of your time!



Special funding for DebConf Newbies
-----------------------------------


If you've never been to a DebConf, but always wanted to go, this
is your year. Joey Hess wrote that a [special
funding for trips to DebConf10](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/Sponsoring_non-regulars_for_DebConf10/) is available for Debian Developers
who have either never attended a
DebConf before, or who have not been to a DebConf since DebConf6
(in Mexico). [DebConf10](https://debconf10.debconf.org)
will be held in New York from August 1-7, 2010.



To apply for this funding, email [Joey Hess](mailto:joeyh@debian.org).
The deadline to apply is May 15th. Please apply as early as possible. In
your email, include an estimate of your travel costs, and the amount you
are unable to fund yourself. Joey also need to know what dates you plan to
arrive and leave. Please indicate if you will also need sponsored food and
accommodation, and whether you have already registered for [DebConf](https://debconf10.debconf.org/register.xhtml).
Also, tell Joey if you've been to DebConf before.
Also, if you work with a Debian Developer in a team, wish they could go to
DebConf, and would like to nominate your teammate for funding, send an email
with the details of who and why.



Debian welcomes Google Summer of Code students
----------------------------------------------


Obey Arthur Liu [welcomed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/04/msg00015.html)
this years Google Summer of code students, who will get their work
on a specific topic financed by Google:


* Piotr Galiszweski, who will work on Aptitude Qt
* Krzysztof Tyszecki, who will work on Content-aware Config Files Upgrading
* David Wendt Jr., who will work on Debbugs Bug Reporting and Manipulation API
* Dominique Belhachemi, who will work on Debian High Performance Computing on Clouds
* Thobaut Girka, who will work on Debian-Installer on Neo FreeRunner and Handheld Devices
* JÃ©rÃ©mie Koenig, who will work on Hurd port and de-Linux-ization of Debian-Installer
* David Kalnischkies, who will work on Multi-Arch support in APT
* Ricardo O'Donell, who will work on Package Repository Analysis and Migration Automation
* Petr Jasek, who will work on Smart Upload Server for FTP Master


We would also thank the involved mentors!


Bits from Debian Groupware Meeting
----------------------------------


Guido GÃ¼nther wrote such a good [bits
from](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/04/msg00013.html) mail that I just cut
and pasted it into this issue of DPN, here it is:

New initramfs-tools package
---------------------------


Maximillian Attems pointed out that there is a new version of the [initramfs-tools](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=initramfs-tools)
package released which satisfies a release goal for Squeeze.
These tools are used fairly early on in the boot
process to create a initramfs which gets used by the kernel as an
initial file system. The new version brings in some changes made by
Ubuntu which should lead to faster boot times. There is an opportunity
here to test this and send along any relevant info to the team that
maintains the package, which is the Debian kernel team at [debian-kernel@lists.debian.org](mailto:debian-kernel@lists.debian.org).
In addition to the ability to
use other forms of compression, there are a number of new fixes and
features in this package. See the [complete
list](http://www.itp.tuwien.ac.at/~mattems/blog/2010/04/06#initramfs-tools_0.94).


MIPS architecture news
----------------------


Andreas Barth send some [information
on the mips and mipsel buildd status](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/04/msg00010.html) (buildd is a build
deamon which automatically
builds Debian binary packages from Debian sources). He mentioned that
they have had some hardware failures leaving them with just one mipsel
buildd currently. While the new buildd sorting order is helping, packages
are still taking a while to be built. Andreas sees an empty build queue
in sight "quite soon" and work is in progress to fix the known
hardware issues with the other machines.


Berlin MiniDebConf
------------------


Jan Hauke Rahm [wrote](http://blog.jhr-online.de/77) that there is going to be held a
MiniDebConf in the middle of LinuxTag on June 10th and 11th. The
MiniDebConf will feature a talk by the new Debian Project Leader as well
as a hack lab which will be open at night. The hack lab could use
some more people to help out and the schedule of talks is almost complete.
The MiniDebConf aims to be newbie friendly with help for new Debian bug
squashers, not least since Debian hopes to be in a freeze by that point.
A Bug Squashing Party be held as well. So why not join the German
[Cabal in
Berlin](http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Miniconf-LT-Berlin/2010)?



Release-critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [unofficial
RC-bugs count](http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php), the upcoming release, Debian 6.0
Squeeze, is currently affected by 364 release critical bugs. 76 of them
have already been fixed in Debian's unstable branch. Of the remaining
288 release critical bugs, 38 already have a patch (which might need
testing) and 14 are marked as pending.


Ignoring these bugs as well as release critical bugs for packages in
contrib or non-free, 172 release critical bugs remain to be solved for the
release to happen.


Important Debian Security Advisories

Debian's Security Team recently released advisories for these packages
