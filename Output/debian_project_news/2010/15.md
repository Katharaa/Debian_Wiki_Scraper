Debian and Google Code-in 2010
------------------------------


After Debian has been successfully participated in the last Google
Summer of Code, where Google sponsored students during the summer
holidays to work on specific task for Open Source projects, a new
campaign for pre-university students is now started: the [Google Code-in
2010](http://code.google.com/intl/en/opensource/gci/2010-11/). In this new contest, pre-university students may work on
smaller tasks during one or two weeks, and in the end may win T-Shirts, money and other
prices. Coordination is done again by [Obey
Arthur Liu](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2010/10/msg00342.html), who already started a [general wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/GoogleCodeIn2010) and
is now collecting [tasks](https://wiki.debian.org/GoogleCodeIn2010/Tasks).


Report from openSUSE Conference
-------------------------------



Gerfried Fuchs sent a [report](https://lists.debian.org/20101027075154.GA29575@anguilla.debian.or.at)
of the [openSUSE
Conference](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Conference) where she has been representing Debian through a
talk about Debian - The Project and its Resources whose
[slides](https://deb.li/DebSuSE) are available.
One topic raised was about package naming schemes, sometimes diverting from
upstream for consistency reasons, so inter-distribution tools would require
some layer to map the package name from one distribution to another.



Debian Installer 6.0 Beta1 release
----------------------------------



The first beta release of the installer for Debian Squeeze has been
[released on
October 30th, 2010](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/News/2010/20101030).
This release is dedicated to Frans Pop, who was heavily involved in several
aspects of Debian Installer until he [passed
away](https://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100831), and whose loss is deeply regretted.




Many improvements are added in this release of the installer: new
platforms (Marvell GuruPlug and OpenRD-Ultimate for example),
isohybrid images, and 67 languages are supported, and many more.
The [errata](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/errata)
gather details and a full list of known issues.
You are welcome to test the installer and report bugs;
media and other information are available on the [Debian Installer pages](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer).
Especially, the new Win32-Loader should be tested
on all Windows versions for all languages.



Minutes from mini-DebConf Paris
-------------------------------



The [first mini-DebConf Paris](http://fr2010.mini.debconf.org/)
has just been held a week ago in the PPS laboratory of Université Paris 7.
According to Stefano Zacchiroli, it was a [complete
success](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2010/10/mini_debconf_paris_-_success/) gathering about 150 people from all over Europe.
Stefano finalized the [Debian Sprint
Program](https://wiki.debian.org/Sprints), and [Lucas
Nussbaum](http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=593) worked on [UDD](https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi) and [his
piuparts replacement](https://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/collab-qa/debcluster/scripts/tasks/instest.rb) between [two](http://www.loria.fr/~lnussbau/files/minidebconfparis2010-debian-ubuntu.pdf)
[talks](http://www.loria.fr/~lnussbau/files/minidebconfparis2010-debian-qa.pdf).
The [Bug Squashing Party](https://wiki.debian.org/BSP2010/Paris)
also permitted to close (and fill) some bugs.



Mini-DebConf in Ho Chi Minh City
--------------------------------



For the first time in Vietnam, the [fifth mini-DebConf in Asia](https://www.debian.org/News/2010/20101102) will be
held during FOSSASIA 2010 in Ho Chi Minh City on November 12-14, 2010.
The mini-DebConf will feature talks from different Debian
Developers and contributers covering technical, social and policy
topics, as well as a translation workshop to foster the Vietnamese
translation community and to teach how to translate in Debian.
More information is available at the
[organisation
page](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianVietnam/MiniDebConf2010).



Bits from the Website Team
--------------------------



Gerfried Fuchs sent some [Bits
from the Website Team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/11/msg00001.html) in which she summarized the recent activities of the
team. Besides announcing that www-master was recently moved to another host,
she reported the progress made in the website redesign process.
Since several months, in fact, Gerfried Fuchs and Martin Zobel-Helas are working
on implementing the [Kalle
Söderman's proposal](http://kalleswork.net/projects/debian/) for the new website design across different sites and
there are already available several previews:
[www.deb.at](http://www.deb.at/),
[debienna.at](http://debienna.at),
[dsa.debian.org](https://dsa.debian.org/),
[git.deb.at](http://git.deb.at/),
[lists.deb.at](http://lists.deb.at/),
[packages.deb.at](http://packages.deb.at/), and
[planet.deb.at](http://planet.deb.at/).
You can follow the further progress on the related [wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/KallesDesign) and help the team
testing new design with different web browser.
The mail ends with a call for further contributors, which are always welcome.
A lot of different things need to get done, and not all of them require
specific skills.
