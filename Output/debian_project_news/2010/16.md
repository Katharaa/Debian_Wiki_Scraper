State of Debian 6.0 Squeeze
---------------------------


Release Manager Neil McGovern gave an update for the upcoming
Debian 6.0 Squeeze stable release. As Squeeze is almost in its final form
he calls for upgrade and installation tests (see also the separate [announcement for
that](https://www.debian.org/News/2010/20101116b)). He also notes that even (experienced) users who have no systems available for
installation or upgrade tests can help by triaging [installation reports](https://bugs.debian.org/installation-reports)
and [upgrade reports](https://bugs.debian.org/upgrade-reports), or
propose text for the [release notes](https://bugs.debian.org/release-notes).


Highlights from the Debian linux-2.6 Meeting
--------------------------------------------


A report from Maximilian Attems on the Debian kernel group's
meeting at the Paris mini-Debconf in October was sent to the Debian
kernel mailing list. Among the things they discussed was the move to
Git as a source code management tool, allowing the kernel group to not
have to update infrastructure in separate branches as we have to do
now.  
 The report also mentions the reduction of Linux kernel
patches for Wheezy: Several patches got pushed or landed since
2.6.32, thus state is in general good. Much more (e.g. about different
patches for virtualisation, the need for automated tests, and Linux Security
Modules) can be read in the
[original
email](https://lists.debian.org/20101111135212.GU19612@vostochny.stro.at).


New default artwork for Debian Squeeze
--------------------------------------


Yves-Alexis Perez announced the [results of
the Debian Squeeze Artwork contest](https://lists.debian.org/1289334281.2898.2.camel@hidalgo): the winner is the theme [Space Fun](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianArt/Themes/SpaceFun) by
Valessio Brito. Congratulations!  

The new theme has been added to the [desktop-base](https://packages.debian.org/desktop-base) package,
and is already available in Debian's development branch Sid.


Debian Women IRC Training Sessions
----------------------------------


The Debian Women project launched a new initiative to encourage more
people, and specifically women, to contribute to Debian while introducing
them to different aspects of the Debian Project: [IRC Training Sessions](https://www.debian.org/News/2010/20101116a).
The first session took place last Thursday, and was visited by many
interested people. Longtime Debian contributor Lars Wirzenius gave an
introduction to Debian packaging and was available for all kinds of
questions. The training session is also available as a [tutorial on the Debian
wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/IntroDebianPackaging).  

More training sessions with topics like Bug Tracking System usage,
Using Git, and Python libraries and application packaging (and
many other interesting topics) are [already planned
in the Debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianWomen/TrainingSessions).


Bits from the DPL
-----------------


Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli sent another
[bits
from the DPL](https://lists.debian.org/20101113034904.GA12174@upsilon.cc) report. He mentions events he has attended (see for
example his separate short report about the [Ubuntu
Developer Summit](https://lists.debian.org/20101110105635.GA9155@upsilon.cc)) and the [Debian
Sprint program](https://lists.debian.org/20101031153712.GB26445@upsilon.cc), making it easier for Debian Contributors to meet for
developer gatherings. Last but not least he also asks for [midterm
feedback](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2010/10/midterm_feedback_sought/) about his work as DPL.


Bits from the Debian Multimedia Maintainers
-------------------------------------------


Alessio Treglia sent some [bits
from the Debian Multimedia Maintainers](https://lists.debian.org/1289700356.5418.7.camel@alessio-laptop). While also giving a small
introduction to this team, he concentrates on multimedia related features
for consumers as well as producers in the upcoming Debian 6.0 Squeeze.
Some of the highlights for consumers are a non-crippled
version of [ffmpeg](https://packages.debian.org/ffmpeg) and
the introduction of a [mencoder](https://packages.debian.org/mencoder) package. He also
gave an overview of multimedia production related platforms,
technologies and end user applications.


Interview with Debian Developer Joey Hess
-----------------------------------------


Raphaël Hertzog published an [interview
with long-time Debian Developer Joey Hess](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/11/11/people-behind-debian-joey-hess-of-debhelper-fame/), who's already well known to
Debian Developers for his work on [debconf](https://packages.debian.org/debconf), the configuration system for
Debian packages, [debhelper](https://packages.debian.org/debhelper), a collection of
helper scripts to ease package creation, or the [debian-installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer)
(d-i for short). When he was asked about his biggest achievement, he answered:
But while it might sound corny, I am more proud of the accumulation of
all the smaller things done in the context of Debian. Joey Hess, who
by the way also once laid the base for this newsletter, also gives some
insights about his plans for Debian Wheezy, what person he most admires,
and whether he regrets having written most of his applications in Perl.


Revival of the m68k port?
-------------------------


Although [Debian supported the
Motorola 680x0 processors](https://www.debian.org/ports/m68k/) from Debian 2.0
Hamm, support for that architecture was dropped with Debian 4.0
Etch for various reasons. One of the main factors was limited
support of the C library and other parts of the toolchain. However,
Thorsten Glaser recently started to work on these [issues](https://www.mirbsd.org/permalinks/wlog-10_e20101016-tg.htm#e20101016-tg_wlog-10).
He has already made some progress and reports having been able to compile 84
core source packages for a first [sort
of re-bootstrapping](https://www.mirbsd.org/permalinks/wlog-10_e20101106-tg.htm#e20101106-tg_wlog-10).

Luca Bruno [reported
on the Italian l10n community](http://kaeso.wordpress.com/2010/11/10/online-sprints-or-how-to-revive-a-l10n-team/). While he confesses that the Italian
language team has failed at attracting new members, he also reported about
quite successful online sprints which took place recently.


Cyril Brulebois from the X Strike Force gave a report about the [state of X in
experimental](http://blog.ikibiki.org/2010/11/10/XServer_1.9/) and also elaborated on dependency handling of X related
packages. Julien Viard de Galbert, who recently joined the
X Strike Force, blogged about his [experiences joining the
team](http://silicone.homelinux.org/2010/11/03/working-on-x-isnt-that-hard/). His conclusion? Working on X isn't that hard!


Petter Reinholdtsen [noticed](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_in_3D.html)
someone creating a [three
dimensional Debian swirl](http://blog.thingiverse.com/2010/11/09/participatory-branding/) with a 3d printer.


In a recent [poll
by the German Pro-Linux Webzine](http://www.pro-linux.de/umfragen/2/27/welche-ist-die-wichtigste-distribution.html), Debian was named as the most important
Linux distribution by 47% of the participants.

 or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about
123 release-critical bugs remain to be solved for the
 release to happen.
