Debian turns 17
---------------


The seventeenth birthday of the Debian Project caused [quite](http://www.tecchannel.de/pc_mobile/news/2030272/debian_wird_17_jahre_alt/)
[some](http://www.itwire.com/opinion-and-analysis/open-sauce/41241-how-to-thank-debian-for-17-great-years)
[media](http://www.dobreprogramy.pl/Debian-ma-juz-lat,Aktualnosc,19930.html)
[echo](http://www.marlexsystems.org/debian-festeja-17-anos-de-existencia/11374/),
[birthday parties](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay2010) and
[c](http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/478)[o](http://jonathancarter.org/2010/08/16/happy-birthday-debian-2/)[n](http://news.debian.net/)[g](http://blog.venthur.de/2010/08/16/happy-birthday-debian/)[r](http://digitizor.com/2010/08/16/happy-17th-birthday-debian-and-some-interesting-history/)[a](http://www.stormos.org/node/2327)[t](http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/debian-26/happy-17th-birthday-debian-826722/)[u](http://www.linux.com/community/blogs/happy-17th-birthday-debian.html)[l](https://lists.debian.org/20100816111701.717D7C818@nereida.gnuservers.com.ar)[a](http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=541)[t](http://andrew.mcmillan.net.nz/blog/thank_you_debian)[i](http://www.itoperationz.com/2010/08/happy-birthday-debian/)[o](http://blog.irwan.name/?p=1520)[n](http://insidesocal.com/click/2010/08/happy-belated-birthday-debian.html)[s](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2010/08/happy_birthday_debian/).


As a surprise present for most Debian contributors, Maintainers and Developers,
users were asked to submit their thanks via the website [thanks.debian.net](http://thanks.debian.net), and birthday balloons pointing
to that page were added to several of Debian's web services.


About [3000 submissions](http://thank.debian.net/read_thanks) were
received, ranging from plain Thanks in various forms, up to [heartwarming](http://www.marga.com.ar/blog/index.cgi/debian/Debian_Appreciation_Day_Recap.html)
messages in [(to most of us) foreign
languages](http://thank.debian.net/message/136). We would like to thank all users for their feedback, which
really strengthened our project's morale and motivation! Thanks!


As an unrelated sidenote, the editor would also like to mention that
Debian's [bug submission tool
reportbug](https://bugs.debian.org/reportbug) supports a --kudos option, making it
easy to submit thanks to package maintainers on the other 364 days of the year
;).


Screenshots at packages.debian.org
----------------------------------


As it is often easier to get an impression of an application by looking
at screenshots, instead of just reading a descriptive text, Gerfried
Fuchs [has
integrated](http://rhonda.deb.at/blog/debian/packages-screenshots.html) the [screenshots.debian.net service](http://screenshots.debian.net)
into the package information at [packages.debian.org](https://packages.debian.org). See for example
the screenshot of the package [extremetuxracer](https://packages.debian.org/sid/extremetuxracer).


For packages that do not yet have a screenshot available, a placeholder
image is shown. Users are encouraged to contribute by uploading their own
screenshots for their favourite applications.


Some bits from ARM porters
--------------------------


Riku Voipio published some [unofficial
bits from the ARM porters](http://suihkulokki.blogspot.com/2010/08/unnofficial-bits-from-arm-porters.html) in which he thanked ARM and Canonical for
sponsoring new machines for the project. Besides giving Debian Contributors
a three times faster machine for their development work, it has allowed the buildd
infrastructure of machines automatically building new packages for specific architectures
and suites to be renewed, so that experimental
packages, [volatile](https://www.debian.org/volatile/) packages,
non-free packages and packages from [backports.org](http://www.backports.org/) are now automatically
built as well. Finally, he announced some work being done on a [Hardfloat
ARM port](https://lists.debian.org/debian-arm/2010/08/msg00008.html), which will work better on newer ARM processors with a hardware
floating-point unit.


Join the DebConf Team
---------------------


Richard Darst started a [series of blog
posts about the organisation of the annual Debian Conference](http://debian-administration.org/users/rkd/weblog/1) by
commenting on the recent DebConf & Debian discussion. He
doesn't see a difference between the two, and invites all interested
people to join the organisation team by subscribing to the [DebConf team
mailing list](http://lists.debconf.org/mailman/listinfo/debconf-team) and joining the #debconf-team IRC channel on
irc.debian.org. In his
[second post](http://debian-administration.org/users/rkd/weblog/2),
he explained the timeline of a DebConf.


Progress of the Debian GNU/kFreeBSD port
----------------------------------------


Different aspects of the port of the Debian operating system [to the FreeBSD kernel](https://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu/)
have made great progress recently. The Debian installer has been [upgraded](https://lists.debian.org/20100818113558.GA24988@hall.aurel32.net)
to the FreeBSD kernel version 8.1, which also allows the
installation system to be used in languages other than English. Also the [debian-cd](https://packages.debian.org/debian-cd) scripts used to
create CD and DVD images [now support the creation
of the new architectures](http://blog.einval.com/2010/08/20#kfreebsd_cds). Daily build images for Debian unstable are
already available; daily and weekly builds for Squeeze will be made available
with the next beta release of the Debian installer. However, the Debian
GNU/kFreeBSD related web pages are outdated, and help is needed to [fix the web and
wiki pages](https://lists.debian.org/4C6EAAE9.7090500@aurel32.net).


Bits from the MIA team
----------------------


Jan Hauke Rahm sent some [bits
from the MIA team](https://lists.debian.org/20100819082337.GA3379@ca.home.jhr-online.de), which tries to identify and handle package maintainers
who sadly have become inactive. He gave some advice on how package maintainers should
react when they think a package has been neglected by its maintainer, and
stressed that the work of the MIA team is an important aspect of
quality assurance.


Other news
----------


Valessio Brito [wondered](https://lists.debian.org/20100822233610.17057e8pnlc6inq2@ssl.eumx.net)
whether a webchat interface similar to the one used during the last Debian conference
should be permanently available, to make it easier for users unfamiliar with
IRC to join.


Martin Zobel-Helas [noted](https://lists.debian.org/20100817190121.GA31072@ftbfs.de) that
now more than 50% of Debian's hosts and public services are reachable over
IPv6.


Release-critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [unofficial
 release-critical bug counter](http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php), the upcoming release,
 Debian 6.0 Squeeze, is currently affected by
302 release-critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved
 or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about
128 release critical bugs remain to be solved for the
 release to happen.


There are also [more detailed
 statistics](http://blog.schmehl.info/Debian/rc-stats/#2010-33) as well as some [hints on how to
 interpret](https://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats) these numbers.


Important Debian Security Advisories
------------------------------------


Debian's Security Team recently released
 advisories for these packages (among others):

[lxr-cvs](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2092),
