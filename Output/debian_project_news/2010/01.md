Bits from the Release Team
--------------------------


Release manager Adam Barratt sent [Bits
from the release team](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/04/msg00001.html) which gave an overview of the state of the
upcoming release, Debian 6.0 Squeeze. Adam admits that the
situation is not as good as the release team hoped, but that it is possible
to release Squeeze in a few months. He also gave a list of known
transitions and asked people to inform the release team about missing items.
Regarding the timeline, he asked all involved people to work hard, so a
freeze in late May or June would be possible. He concludes with some hints
on how to help. Most important is to fix release critical bugs or
organise face-to-face meetings to fix these. Andreas Barth later
[blogged](http://blogs.turmzimmer.net/2010/04/04#squeeze-9) a
more detailed list on how to help with the release.


Estimates of the number of Debian users
---------------------------------------


In the discussion about the upcoming elections for the Debian Project
Leader, [Anthony
Towns](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2010/03/msg00205.html) wondered how many users Debian has. Several people discussed
who is a Debian user and if users of Debian derivatives would count,
too. Another topic was how accurate [popcon.debian.org](https://popcon.debian.org/) (a service where
Debian users can report anonymously what packages they have installed)
reflects the number of installations. Mike Hommey [analysed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2010/03/msg00324.html)
the installations reported for [xulrunner](https://packages.debian.org/xulrunner-1.9.1)
(the rendering engine used by the Iceweasel browser) and compared them to the
hits of the page displayed after an upgrade. He came to the conclusion
that for every one of the 13,000 Iceweasel installations reported to
popcon, there are at least 7.7 additional Iceweasel installations, which
do not have popcon installed or activated, while Simon Paillard found
1.5 million unique IP addresses in the access logs of security.debian.org.


Bits from the DPL
-----------------


Shortly before the end of his term Debian Project Leader Steve McIntyre
sent a [(Final)
Bits from (this) DPL](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/04/msg00000.html). He announced personnel changes in several
teams and mentioned some press contacts and their outcome. He also
announced the availability of Debian Certification for official
Developers: It seems that more and more companies are keen to hire
Debian folks, so it can be useful to have this kind of documentation
available. Steve also talked about suggestions made in the last few
months for ways to productively spend Debian money, including funding of
needed hardware and a large number of developer meetings, as well as
funding for the Debian Edu subproject, to help them to continue their
developer meetings into the future. He closed by wishing the candidates of
the current election good luck and is looking forwards to having more time
for some hacking.


New archive snapshot service available
--------------------------------------


A new service called <http://snapshot.debian.org/> has just
been [announced](https://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100412).
snapshot.debian.org is a wayback machine that allows access to old packages
based on dates and version numbers. The ability to install packages and
view source code from any given date can be very helpful to developers and
users alike. It provides a valuable resource for tracking down when
regressions were introduced, or for providing a specific environment that a
particular application may require to run. The snapshot archive is
accessible like any normal apt repository, allowing it to be easily used by
all.


The archive currently holds almost all packages from the main and
security archives since March 2005, as well as selected additional
archives like [debian-volatile](https://www.debian.org/volatile/), [debian-ports](http://www.debian-ports.org/) and [backports.org](http://www.backports.org). This new
service currently holds about 6.5 terabytes of data and will grow
constantly.


MiniDebConf held in Panama
--------------------------


More than 50 people participated recently in a MiniDebConf in Panama.
Starting March 20th and lasting two full days, the MiniDebConf touched on a
variety of subjects involving Debian with the participants sharing their experiences
with both Debian and Free Software. As [Alejandro Rios
said](http://alerios-en.blogspot.com/2010_03_01_archive.html): All this is possible thanks to several sponsors from Panama and SPI, and
the hard work from many people, specially Anto Recio, Mauro Rosero, Carolina
Flores, Gunnar Wolf and the local team. SPI is
[Software in the Public Interest](https://www.spi-inc.org/), a
non-profit organisation which was founded to help organisations develop and
distribute open hardware and software.


The MiniDebConf got quite technical, some of the subjects they covered were:
Packaging, Debian's Bug Tracking System, the Linux Kernel, pbuilder and quilt.
There was also time for some socialising as there was a visit to the Panama
Canal as well as a group photo and apparently some people even gathered to
drink beer. Sounds to me like a successful MiniDebConf. More info on [Alejandro's blog (in English).](http://alerios-en.blogspot.com/)


First German Debian Mini Conference
-----------------------------------


The Debian Project announced the first [German Debian Mini
Conference](https://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100408) to be held on the 10th and 11th of June in Berlin. Embedded
into [LinuxTag](http://www.linuxtag.org/), one of the most
important Open Source events in Europe, it will feature two days of talks,
workshops and panel discussions for Debian Developers and Maintainers to
contributors, users and otherwise interested persons. In parallel to the
conference, in a neighbouring hacking area a Bug Squashing Party will be
held. Details are available in the [DebConf
Wiki](http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Miniconf-LT-Berlin/2010).


Graphical Installer for ARM-Based netbooks
------------------------------------------


Frans Pop [blogged](https://alioth.debian.org/~fjp/log/posts/Debianizing_an_ARM-based_netbook.html)
about his work on porting Debian and the debian-installer to ARM-based
netbooks from ChiTech. After solving some problems due to the limitations
of the bootloader, he even managed to get the X11 based graphical installer
running on that device.


QEMU image for SH4 port available
---------------------------------


To make debugging of problems with the (unofficial) port to the [SH4 architecture](https://wiki.debian.org/SH4) easier, Aurelien
Jarno [provides](http://blog.aurel32.net/?p=55) SH4 images to be
used with [qemu](https://packages.debian.org/qemu). The images
have some limitations as they can only use 64MB and need the current [development version of
qemu](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/qemu.git).



The role of the Debian ftpmasters
---------------------------------


[lwn.net](http://lwn.net/) published a lengthy article about
[the role of the Debian
ftpmasters](https://lwn.net/Articles/381667/) (article will be freely available from 15th April) and their kind of unique position compared to other
distributions. Based upon explanations and a recent [call
for volunteers](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/03/msg00003.html) from ftp-master JÃ¶rg Jaspert, the article explains the
duties and problems the ftp-team is facing.


Other news
----------


The Atlantic Canada Open Source Showcase published an
[interview
with Ben Armstrong](http://acoss.wordpress.com/2010/03/29/interview-with-ben-armstrong-debian-eee-pc-project-leader/) about his work on the
[Debian Eee PC project](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEeePC).


DSA Martin Zobel-Helas [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/04/msg00004.html),
that the Debian Project got four powerful MIPS machines donated by [Movidis](http://www.movidis.com/). Two or three will be used as
build daemon, the remaining one is accessible for all Developers as porter
machine.


Christine Spang [asked](http://blog.spang.cc/posts/is_your_keysigning_offer_up_to_date__63__/)
Debian Developers listed on the [keysigning
offers list](https://wiki.debian.org/Keysigning/Offers) to check their data regularly. She also added that it is
possible to subscribe to changes in the
[list of people requesting
keysigning](https://wiki.debian.org/Keysigning/Need).


Sune Vuorela [reported](http://pusling.com/blog/?p=158) about
the Eckhart slope: quite a drop of the number of KDE related
bugs.


Sylvestre Ledru [gave
an update](http://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/sylvestre/2010/04/06/update_of_the_linear_algebra_libraries_i) about linear algebra libraries (e.g.
[blas](https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=sourcenames&keywords=blas)
and [lapack](https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=sourcenames&keywords=lapack))
in Debian, which are used by various numerical programs in Debian (e.g.
[OpenOffice.org
Calc](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=openoffice.org-calc)). He emphasised how the packages deal with optimisation for
different CPUs (like SSE in different versions).


New Developers and Maintainers
------------------------------


Seven applicants have [been](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2010/04/msg00016.html)
[accepted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2010/03/msg00063.html)
as Debian Maintainer in the last two weeks. Please welcome Joachim
Wiedorn, Kai Wasserbaech, Gabriele Giacone, Ahmed El-Mahmoudy, Niels
Thykier, Stephen Leake and Daiki Ueno into our project!


Release-critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [unofficial
RC-bugs count](http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php), the upcoming release, Debian 6.0
Squeeze, is currently affected by 445 release critical bugs. 108 of them
have already been fixed in Debian's unstable branch. Of the remaining
337 release critical bugs, 53 already have a patch (which might need
testing) and 21 are marked as pending.


Ignoring these bugs as well as release critical bugs for packages in
contrib or non-free, 196 release critical bugs remain to be solved for the
release to happen.


Important Debian Security Advisories
------------------------------------


Debian's Security Team recently released advisories for these packages
(among others):
[drupal6](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2016), [php5](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2018), [ikiwiki](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2020), [spamass-milter](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2021), [mediawiki](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2022), [curl](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2023), [moin](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2024), [icedove](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2025), [xulrunner](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2027) and [xpdf](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2028).
