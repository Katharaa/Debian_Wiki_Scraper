Debian Community Poll
---------------------


After getting the idea during the recent [Mini Debian
Conference](http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Miniconf-LT-Berlin/2010) in Berlin, Torsten Werner [prepared](http://twerner.blogspot.com/2010/06/debian-community-poll.html)
a [poll for users of the Debian Operating
System](http://go.debian.net/3vGnI) asking different types of questions like the usage of derivatives,
about the [Debian
Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) and firmwares and of course releases.


The Poll is available at <http://go.debian.net/3vGnI>. Torsten asks
to spread the link to as many users as possible.


Automatic installation of hardware-specific packages
----------------------------------------------------


Petter Reinholdtsen introduced a new change into the Debian installation
system allowing the installation of [hardware-specific
packages](https://lists.debian.org/2fly6f0ypze.fsf@login2.uio.no) at installation time (or on an already installed
system). This is useful for certain RAID controllers, graphic adapters and
other hardware, and is done by mapping PCI and USB IDs to the names of Debian
packages. Petter welcomes help maintaining this list.


He also pointed out that for hot swappable devices this approach won't
work, and wonders whether the existing [discover](https://packages.debian.org/discover) package should be adapted
to also support listening to DBus events, or whether [PackageKit](http://www.packagekit.org/) could be ported to
Debian.


Desktop artwork and themes for Debian Squeeze
---------------------------------------------


Valessio Brito [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-desktop/2010/06/msg00003.html)
to collect ideas and proposals for the [desktop artwork
used in Debian 6.0 Squeeze](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDesktopArtworkSqueeze). This artwork would be the base for
common themes throughout the system. Yves-Alexis Perez started to [list
possible uses](https://lists.debian.org/debian-desktop/2010/06/msg00004.html) for that artwork ranging from themes for different
desktop environments through boot splash screens to website banners. He also
asked for more comments about the artwork from other users.


Debian Installer string freeze coming up
----------------------------------------


Christian Perrier [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/20100606071056.GA16165@mykerinos.kheops.frmug.org)
a string freeze in order to officially notify translators that they should
consider completing their current work. Christian wrote: During the string
freeze, developers would be required to avoid committing changes that involved
modifications to localizable strings. Each of these would require a prior
discussion in debian-boot and a formal ACK to commit. He proposed [Sunday July 4th as deadline for the string freeze](https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2010/06/msg00015.html). Time to finish up those translations!



Provisional list of talks for DebConf10
---------------------------------------


Ana Guerrero [announced](https://lists.debian.org/20100609025528.GA19122@pryan.ekaia.org)
the publication of a [provisional list
of talks for DebConf10](http://penta.debconf.org/dc10_schedule/events.en.html). She also mentioned the opportunities for ad-hoc events to be
scheduled during DebConf, in order to plan a last minute event with others once
at DebConf. Details on the scheduling of these events will be available at the
conference.


Some of the planned highlights are Bits from the Debian Project
Leader, Debian in (and on) the cloud, Debian/kFreeBSD from the
FreeBSD Point of View, Multimedia Patents vs. Debian, RC bug
fixing + NMU = Fun and The Nexenta Project: OpenSolaris + APT +
GNU.


License usage in Debian
-----------------------


While working on requests to add specific license texts to
/usr/share/common-licenses/, Russ Allbery wrote a script to check
which licenses are used how often in the Debian archive. He also published [his
results](https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy/2010/06/msg00099.html). Unsurprisingly, the most used licenses are the different forms and
versions of the GNU General Public License.


Other news
----------


Ana Guerrero [announced](https://lists.debian.org/20100525173727.GA5200@pryan.ekaia.org)
that the migration of the [Debian-Women wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianWomen) into
Debian's wiki is now complete. There's still a little work to do: if you
want to contribute, take a look at the [migration TODO
list](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianWomen#migrationTODO).


Adrian von Bidder announced that he will now [take
orders](http://blog.fortytwo.ch/archives/84-Order-Your-Debian-Swirl-Umbrella-Now.html) for [Debian
Umbrellas](http://blog.fortytwo.ch/archives/80-Yay!-Debian-Logo!.html).


Bill Allombert announced that [circular
dependencies in unstable reached an all-time low](https://lists.debian.org/20100606132103.GJ11095@yellowpig). Even if fixing some might be too
intrusive for Squeeze, Petter Reinholdtsen noticed that some
of them may also cause [upgrades from
Lenny to Squeeze to fail](https://lists.debian.org/2flr5kgozc0.fsf@login2.uio.no).


Andrew Pollock blogged about his recent [progress
on the ISC DHCP 4.1 package](http://blog.andrew.net.au/2010/06/08#dhcp_4.1_progress_report2): packages in experimental appear to work, and
upgrade cleanly from the 3.1 packages, so they will soon reach unstable.


The [previous issue of
the Debian Project News](https://www.debian.org/News/project/2010/04/) mentioned that the boot loader [LILO](https://packages.debian.org/lilo) was about to removed from
Debian due to missing upstream development. In the [following
discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2010/06/msg00117.html) Joachim Wiedorn volunteered to take over upstream development,
while the Debian Maintainer William Pitcock will continue [taking care
of packaging](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2010/06/msg00137.html) once upstream development created a release that actually has
merit.


Bastian Blank wondered whether Debian 6.0 Squeeze should be shipped
[Xen 3.4 or
4.0](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2010/06/msg00220.html) and listed some pros and cons for both versions.


New Developers and Maintainers
------------------------------


Six applicants have been
[accepted](https://lists.debian.org/E1OLPhC-0004Dr-AN@merkel.debian.org)
as Debian Developers and two applicants have been
[accepted](https://lists.debian.org/E1OJ5es-00033L-A1@ries.debian.org)
as Debian Maintainer since the previous issue of the Debian
Project News. Please welcome Dominique Belhachemi, Sylvain Beucler, Scott
Kitterman, Giovanni Mascellani, Alessio Treglia, Ulises Vitulli,
Hannes von Haugwitz and Tang Ke into our project!


Release-critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------


According to the [unofficial
RC-bugs count](http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php), the upcoming release, Debian 6.0
Squeeze, is currently affected by
424 release critical bugs.
81 of them have already been fixed in Debian's unstable branch. Of the remaining
343 release critical bugs,
46 already have a patch (which might need testing) and
14 are marked as pending.


Ignoring these bugs as well as release critical bugs for packages in contrib or non-free,
211 release critical bugs remain to be solved for the
release to happen.


Important Debian Security Advisories
------------------------------------


Debian's Security Team recently released advisories for these packages
(among others):
[bind9](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2054),
[OpenOffice.org](https://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2055),
