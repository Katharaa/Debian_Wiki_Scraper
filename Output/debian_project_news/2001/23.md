Debian Weekly News - September 25th, 2001
=========================================


**KDE 2.2.1 and Xinerama.** Ivan Moore's KDE 2.2.1 packages
are compiled without Xinerama support for reasons [too lengthy to go into here](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kde/2001/debian-kde-200109/msg00246.html). However, if you want to find some packages
with Xinerama compiled, David Bishop has been kind enough to put some
[here](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kde-0109/msg00258.html)


**Using HFS+ with Linux.** There has been a [discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-powerpc-0109/msg00315.html)
about using HFS+ partitions with Linux. They are used on Mac OS X for large
partitions. A Linux driver is, however, unstable and abandoned. Several
people have experienced kernel panics when accessing HFS partitions. The only
way to access this filesystem with Linux is to use userspace HFS+ tools from
the [hfsplus](https://packages.debian.org/hfsplus) package.
Alternatively one could use UFS partitions which Mac OS X supports and for
which an experimental Linux driver is available.


**Using Mosix on Debian GNU/Linux.** Viral Shah has written a
[HOWTO](http://www.mayin.org/~gandalf/doc/mosix-debian/mosix-debian.html)
about using [Mosix](http://www.mosix.org/) on Debian GNU/Linux.
Mosix is a scalable, multi-os, transparent load balancing tool, which
unfortunately only works on the x86 architecture. The HOWTO provides a step
by step introduction to using Mosix, which is available as Debian packages
already.


**New Treasurer for SPI.** The general meeting of Software in
the Public Interest, Inc., has [appointed](https://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/resolutions/resolution-2001-08-30.mgs)
Branden Robinson, the fabulous X guy from Debian, as new treasurer for the
corporation on September 17, 2001. SPI forms a legal umbrella around the
Debian project.


**Security Secretary.** Current problems with [Debian Security](https://www.debian.org/security/) have led Joey into
reconsidering the situation. Debian Security is very crucial to our users and
thus should be managed properly. To help improve the situation, Joey has [asked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-0109/msg00225.html)
for a Security Secretary, who will help the Debian Security Team doing their
work.


**English, British English or American English?** There has
been a [discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg00878.html)
on Debian-Devel inspired by Marcelo E. Magallon and [Bug#111465](https://bugs.debian.org/111465) which brought up a problem
with creating an alias "English" for either en\_US or en\_GB. There have been
many voices in favour of naming en\_GB.ISO-8859-1 as "English" since the
language comes from Great Britain and is spoken outside of it as well, similar
to French being fr\_FR and Spanish being es\_ES, even while the language itself
is spoken outside of France or Spain in a local version.


**No More Evil?** Last week we reported on the evils of
/usr/share/java/repository. Ola Lundqvist was kind enough to
[summarize](https://lists.debian.org/debian-java/2001/debian-java-200109/msg00105.html) the results of the discussion so far. Java fiends may wish to
peruse this summary and join in the discussion. The prevention of further evil
may depend on it!


**Apache Task Force.** Ardo van Rangelrooij has [proposed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg00897.html) to
form an Apache Task Force that will maintain the Apache packages. The current
state of Apache and the recent need to fix at least some of the outstanding
bugs led him to the conclusion that a more active maintenance of these packages is
needed. This includes an Apache Task Force Webpage defining goals, writing up
guidelines for packaging Apache modules, setting up a CVS repository and
migrating the Debian apache packages to Apache 2, which is already [prepared](http://kabuki.sfarc.net/apache2/) by Thom May and Daniel
Stone. Several people have already volunteered to help out. Looks like there
will be new Apache packages soon - better than ever. A [preliminary
mailing list](https://lists.madduck.net/mailman/listinfo/debian-apache) has been created already.


**Preview of new Ghostscript packages.** Torsten Landschoff has
[announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg00957.html)
new Ghostscript packages which are up for testing. This includes both gs 6.51
as well as gs-aladdin 7.00. Torsten is going to throw away the upstream
scripts and replace them with his own ones.


**New update\_excuses output.** Anthony Towns has [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg01039.html)
that there will be a new set of lines in the [update\_excuses
output](https://release.debian.org/britney/update_excuses.html). His announcement contains an explanation.


**Uninstallable packages in Debian/testing.** Andrew M. Bishop
has posted a [summary](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg01103.html) of
packages in testing which are not installable. The list is depressingly long.
Anthony Towns has [agreed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg01105.html) that
there are a few packages that aren't installable in Woody. A number of
packages are out of sync or even have release-critical bugs. There is also a
[more
accurate list](https://release.debian.org/britney/testing_probs.html) of uninstallable packages.


**Aptitude updated.** We reported on a problem with
`aptitude` in our last issue. Daniel Burrows wrote us: "I just
realized, when I saw this in DWN, that I never followed up to this. The
version of `aptitude` in sid is now free of this bug (and some
stupid segfaults that somehow snuck in at the same time). Install 0.2.6.4,
and if it still doesn't work, report bugs."


**Bootstrapping on SuperH.** Yutaka Niibe has posted a
step-by-step [manual](https://lists.debian.org/debian-superh-0109/msg00001.html) for bootstrapping Debian GNU/Linux distribution on SuperH.
Currently Debian GNU/Linux on i386 is required, including the development
environment as well as binutils-multiarch. Congratulations!


**Graphing Debian Lists.** Joey has played with RRD
apparently. He has created some [graphics](http://murphy.debian.org/lists/) of the mailing lists that
Debian serves on [lists.debian.org](https://lists.debian.org/).
They display both the total list of subscribers as well as the posting
frequency per list. This results in some interesting graphs, such as [Debian-Announce](http://murphy.debian.org/lists/debian-announce/)
whose number of subscribers grow steadily with no postings or [Debian-Alpha](http://murphy.debian.org/lists/debian-alpha/) with
frequent postings but nearly the same number of subscribers.


**New lintian to test.** In our last issue we reported
that Shaleh announced to restart work on lintian. He has already put up
[preliminary .debs](https://people.debian.org/~shaleh/lintian/). Get
them while they're hot.


**Python Policy Draft.** Neil Schemenauer has
[posted](https://lists.debian.org/debian-python-0109/msg00069.html) a draft of a Debian Python Policy. All interested parties should
check it out and send comments to the [debian-python](https://lists.debian.org/debian-python/) list.


**32/64-Bit Coexistence.** There's a lot of
[discussion](https://lists.debian.org/lsb-spec/2001/lsb-spec-200109/msg00000.html) on the LSB-Spec list about a proposal for 32-bit and 64-bit
compatibility on 64-bit systems. Not many of us happen to have 64-bit systems
sitting around at home, but this topic is going to be more and more important
in the future. (Note, if you do have a 64-bit system sitting at home, there's
no need to email us to let us know. Thanks.)


**Correction.** Last week we included an item on Alternatives
in Build-Dependencies and Bdale Garbee's name was misspelled as Bdale Garbie.
Sorry about that Bdale!


**Fonts missing after upgrade.** Several people have reported
problems with fonts after X was upgraded. Characters appeared as boxes within
Gnumeric, GIMP, XMMS or other programs. This is caused by the presence of
ISO10646-1 ("Unicode") encoded fonts in the new 4.1.0 X font packages. Many applications
and toolkits don't specify what character encoding they want when requesting a
font, and aren't equipped to handle the return of a 16-bit font. Using the X
Font Server (`xfs`) from XFree86 4.x will fix the problem. People
have reported that [changing the
font ordering](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0109/msg00436.html) in `/etc/X11/XF86Config-4` will also work, though it
may only be a fortunate coincidence.


**New Packages.** Here's some of the new and notable this
week.
