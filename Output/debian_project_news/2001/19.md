Debian Weekly News - August 14th, 2001
======================================


**XFree86 4.1 hits unstable.** [XFree86](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/xserver-xfree86)
[4.1.0-1](http://incoming.debian.org/DONE/xfree86_4.1.0-1_i386.changes)
hit unstable last week, with an impressive 295 line long changelog, so
we won't try to summarize everything here. It supports ATI PCI cards
on SPARC and includes a VMWare driver. Unfortunately, DRI support
(except 3Dfx) was out of sync with the kernel tree, which has been
fixed in the latest revision of the Linux kernel. Last Friday, [4.1.0-2](http://incoming.debian.org/DONE/xfree86_4.1.0-2_i386.changes)
entered the archives as well, which fixes even more bugs. 


**It's not just for Web serving any more!**
The Debian Multimedia Distribution was announced on the debian-news
mailing list by [Martin "Joey" Schulze](https://lists.debian.org/debian-news-01/msg00030.html). You can find the official DeMuDi
Web page at <http://www.demudi.org/>.


**Here's my card...**
Jim Westveer was kind enough to share a script for creating Debian [bootable
business card images](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0108/msg00002.html). About 50Â MB fit on such a CDROM, so
there is not much space so use. This script copies the Debian boot
floppies onto the image, so that they can be used for an easy
installation and rescue-system. Share and enjoy!


**Debian on the cash desk?** It's true. The German
"Lebensmittelzeitung" has [reported](http://www.lz-net.de/news/webtechnews/pages/show.prl?params=recent=1&type=3&id=23136)
(German only) that [Globus](http://www.globus.net/), a German
supermarket chain, converted about 480 computers in their cash desk system to
Debian GNU/Linux. The entire system is designed so that two cashiers can share
one computer (a 486/25MHz is used most of the time). After positive experiences
they now want to shift more functions to Linux, and also want to install
an automatic installation feature in order to automatically push new functions
or other updates to their cash desk systems on a nightly basis.


**Multilingual Debian.** Michael Bramer has [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2001/debian-devel-announce-200108/msg00003.html)
the start of the Debian Description Translation Server, a project to
translate all package descriptions into languages other than
English. Currently German, French, Italian and Brazilian Portuguese
are supported (others may follow on demand). The project was started 11
weeks ago with only German, and the other languages started 3-4 weeks
ago. The German translation group has already translated 20% of all
package descriptions from sid/main/binary-i386. The other language
translations are in the beginning stages and need more help.


**Debian for the professional desktop?** The German
site Pro-Linux has a [report](http://www.pro-linux.de/news/2001/3339.html) (German
only) about a thin client Linux Desktop solution. Produced by [Natural Computing GmbH](http://www.natural-computing.de/) the
system consists of Debian GNU/Linux which is tailored in size and
functionality in order to comply the requirements of an office
desktop. They have also added additional software like StarOffice and
other typical desktop applications. The [natural.DESKTOP](http://www.natural-computing.de/sites/nd_wptext.html)
is designed to fit the needs of an office desktop system in a
heterogeneous network for use in offices and governmental
environments.


**OpenOffice for Debian.** Another effort was [started](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2001/debian-devel-200108/msg00473.html) to get OpenOffice packaged for Debian. Fetching a current
source snapshot already eats up more than 400MB. Since it's a very large
package more than one person should work on it. Jan-Hendrik Palic is currently
trying to form a group of interested people so one day we can review a couple of
`openoffice*.deb` files. It is said, though, that the build system
for OpenOffice is a complete mess so there is a lot work to be done first.


**S/390 update.** Stefan Gybas has posted a [status report about S/390](https://lists.debian.org/debian-s390/2001/debian-s390-200108/msg00000.html) for woody. All required and important
packages are built, tested on 5 different systems and even installed
into the archive. Some packages like `strace` and
`gdb` are currently missing, however, proper patches are
available for both of them, so they should be included soon. Didn't
you always want to run XFree86 on your S/390? There are even patches
for XFree86 4.1 sent to the maintainer.


**News about Woody's architectures.** Alpha
boot-floppies have made much progress the last few days. A major
obstacle for actually uploading them is that the `ash` in
the archive was severely broken, and the later one didn't build. This
seems to be fixed now. Boot-floppies for mips and mipsel also need
some more days of development and testing. However, it looks like the
porters are ready for uploading them. However, documentation is a
serious issue since it doesn't cover these architectures yet.


**Installing Debian with only 4 MB RAM.** Jens
Scheidtmann has written a [mini-HOWTO](http://7thguard.net/files/DebianHOWTO.txt)
describing how one can install Debian GNU/Linux on a machine with only
4 MB of RAM. Older computers may not be suited for programming or
playing games, but still fit the requirements for a lightwind text
terminal. The bootstrapping process is a bit more complicated as a
normal install of Debian, but it is still doable.
**Want to translate?**
We're always looking for more volunteers to help translate
DWN into more languages. If you're interested, drop us a line
and we'll put you in the loop.


**Help us out!**
If you have some news you'd like to see covered in DWN, don't wait
until the issue comes out and complain that we missed it - send us an
email with your news so we'll be sure to get it in the next issue. We
try to keep up with all the happenings in the wide world of Debian,
but it's not easy. Send your news, comments and nude photos to  [dwn@debian.org](mailto:dwn@debian.org).
