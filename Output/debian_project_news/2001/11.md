Debian Weekly News - May 14th, 2001
===================================


**You like us, you really like us!** We got a slew of letters
(well, emails...) saying that it was good to see DWN back. Thanks
for the show of support, we'll do our best to keep you informed! A
big Kudos to Joey Hess for providing helpful guidance.
**Boot floppy success.** Santiago Garcia Mantinan [reports](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0105/msg00071.html)
that he has had success with a complete install of Woody using the
new boot floppies, and a few modifications of his own. And there was
much rejoicing... A little later, an [updated
progress report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0105/msg00003.html), was posted. According to this, the freeze will
start in June.
**Why care about boot floppies?** A few inquisitive minds
wanted to know what all the fuss about boot floppies was, when they
just wanted to install from CD-ROM. The software used for
installation are all designed to fit on floppy disks, though they
may actually reside on CD-ROM, hard disk or on a
network. For instance, you can download a bootable image sized for
1.2MB, 1.44MB or 2.88MB floppies - but that image can actually
reside on just about any bootable media that your system can
handle. Floppy disks were a much more common install method several
years ago, though many folks install from CD-ROM or do a network
install rather than fussing with floppies.
**Tasks policy proposal.** Anthony Towns [raised
the topic](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0105/msg00075.html) of creating a proper tasks policy for Woody. Anthony
proposes a set of guidelines for task-\* packages that would make a
task-\* package more flexible, and allow for selection of packages
rather than all packages mentioned in the task header.
**Separate phases.** Glenn McGrath [proposed
separating](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0105/msg00110.html) the preparation and installation phases of the Debian
installer to make the installer more versatile. Debian-installer is
the installer project for the version of Debian after woody. It has a
whole new design, while boot-floppies are going to be used for the
last time for woody.
**Security notices.** Several packages have been the subject
of Debian Security Advisories this week. If you're using Zope, mandb,
gftp or Samba, be sure to visit the [Debian Security Page](https://www.debian.org/security/) for
information on upgrading to newer versions.
**JBuilder4 on Debian/PPC.** In case you want to run JBuilder4
on PPC, Franck Routier was kind enough to contribute his success
story and [instructions](https://lists.debian.org/debian-java-0105/msg00004.html)
on getting it running. Thanks for the report, Franck!
**Package list for 2.2r4.** A list of proposed updated packages
for 2.2r4 was [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0105/msg00005.html) by
Martin Schulze.
**New packages this week.** New to Debian this week are the
IDS filesystem checker [fcheck](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/fcheck),
the Java VM
[japhar](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/interpreters/japhar),
XFS filesystem support [kernel-patch-xfs](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/kernel-patch-xfs), the [serpento](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/text/serpento)
dict server and [vcr](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/vcr),
a video capture program.
**Have a suggestion?** If you've got a suggestion, comment or
news item for us send it to [dwn@debian.org](mailto:dwn@debian.org).
