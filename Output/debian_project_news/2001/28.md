Debian Weekly News - October 30th, 2001
=======================================


**MPEG in a Console.** Last week we mentioned that Uwe
Herrman had announced an [Intent to
Package](https://bugs.debian.org/116359) (ITP) for an MPEG player running
in a text console. We got an email from Adam Sjogren saying that plaympeg
from the smpeg-plaympeg package has this capability already. By running plaympeg
in a console, or unsetting the DISPLAY environment variable in an xterm,
it will run in console mode. 


**Linux Down Under.** James Bromberger wrote in to tell
us about a Debian Conference being planned for February 2002 in
Australia. The conference will be February 4th and 5th, two days before
the Linux.conf.au conference. For more information, or to read the Call
for Papers, visit the site at <http://www.linux.org.au/conf/debiancon.html>.


**Feedback from RMS.** We got a response from Richard
M. Stallman about our statement on discussing free and non-free software
in DWN, and we promised to pass it on:

> The situations of GNOME and Debian are not the same, because

For the time being, DWN will continue to report on non-free software
when appropriate -- however, when we do list non-free software in the
"New Packages" section or elsewhere, it will be labelled as such.



**Buildd for Debian/Hurd.** Jeff Bailey happily [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd-0110/msg00233.html)
that he has gotten the Debian [build daemon](https://buildd.debian.org/) to run on his Debian/Hurd
machine. That should help the Hurd port keep up with the rest of the archive.
Logs from this buildd are available on the buildd website above.


**LSB Specification Update.** Upon request, Christopher Yeoh
posted an [update](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0110/msg01811.html) on the LSB Specification. There is ongoing work being done for a
1.0.1 release which will primarily be editorial changes and the fixing of a
few very obvious errors. Both the released version 1.0 and daily snapshots
are found [here](http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/). There is also a
[database](http://base.freestandards.org/lsb/test/results/) of
results from LSB tests online.


**New Potato Release Behind the Door.** Joey is working hard
on getting a new release of Potato out. This will contain most
security updates since the last Potato release as well as a couple of
corrected packages. The plan is to release 2.2r4 at the beginning of November
this year. See his [second
take](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0110/msg00009.html) on the package list and send him comments if you feel that he's
missing something in the [current list](http://master.debian.org/~joey/2.2r4/).


**Debian on DVD!** Slashdot recently [reported](http://slashdot.org/articles/01/10/25/2250255.shtml) that
[LAN Comp Systems](http://www.linux-cd.com/) is distributing
snapshots of the upcoming Debian release, codenamed 'woody', on DVD-R. There
are source and binary-i386 DVDs, containing main, contrib, non-free and
non-US. Looks like an interesting alternative to a 4-5 CD set. Jim Westveer
[explained](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0110/msg00084.html)
how a DVD is mastered with Debian's tools.


**FHS Transition.** Joey Hess [checked](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0110/msg01902.html)
if his system complies with an old [tech committee
decision](https://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte-9908/msg00038.html) from over 2 years ago on how /usr/doc will be transitioned. Joey
says that we are currently near the end of step 2 and `/usr/doc`
consists only of symlinks to `/usr/share/doc`. Except for very few
packages the same applies to `/usr/man` and
`/usr/share/man`, while the transition for `/usr/info`
hasn't yet finished.


**First OpenOffice Debian Package.** Peter Novodvorsky
(Петр Новодворский) [announced](https://lists.debian.org/debian-openoffice-0110/msg00036.html)
the first successful build of OpenOffice #638c for Debian. It compiles into
one single package which is 75MB large. Dooh. It is packaged lousily and
reflects only a pre-pre-alpha stage, but it's a start. Use at your own risk!
OpenOffice, however, has a modularized structure, and thus should be split up
in smaller packages. However, [license
problems](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0110/msg00138.html) with the JDK still remain. See the discussion above for details. In
addition to that Jan-Hendrik Palic recently posted a comprehensive [status
report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-openoffice-0110/msg00041.html).


**New or Noteworthy Packages.**



* [brltty](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/brltty)
 -- Access software for a blind person using a soft braille terminal.
* [xmms-jess](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/sound/xmms-jess)
 -- A "funky" visualisation plugin for XMMS.
* [pari-gp](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/math/pari-gp)
 -- A computer algebra system. Formerly under a non-free license, now released under
 the GPL.


**No News is Good News?** We have no security issues to
report this week.


**Keep it Coming.** We've been getting a lot of useful feedback
and tips about new packages and so on. Keep it up! Until next week, have a
happy Halloween!
