Debian Weekly News - July 1st, 2001
===================================


 **We've just entered phase one of Woody's freeze process.**
Although Release Manager Anthony Towns started off [the announcement](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2001/16/mail#1)  with "*welcome to the woody
freeze*", woody is *not* yet frozen in the traditional sense
of the word. Not quite yet. What we do have is a deadline -- July
24th -- for phase one of the freeze process to complete. This first
phase involves deciding what we want to release, by freezing Debian
policy, deciding what architectures will be in shape to release,
deciding if this release will include crypto in main, and getting the
base system in shape for the freeze. If these deadlines are met by the
24th, the next stage will be freezing the base system. By the way,
it's official -- woody will be Debian 3.0. Quoth AJ: "*This is, to
put it mildly, a somewhat controversial decision, but it's one I get
to make.*" 


**Debian BSD?** The Debian-BSD list has picked up a little
steam lately. The Debian-BSD list has been alive since May of
1999, but "never gets far past the chat stage," to quote
[Gary Kline](https://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0106/msg00013.html). [Andreas Krennmair](https://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0106/threads.html) posted a list of necessary packages, and
there seems to be some intense interest from several people.


**GCC 3.0 Status.** Interested in using GCC 3.0? There's an
instructive discussion on the debian-devel mailing list started
by [Eray Ozkural](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0106/msg01384.html) about the status of the GCC 3.0 packages in
testing. A note for newbies, GCC is the GNU Compiler Collection.
At one time it stood for GNU C Compiler, but GCC now supports
a number of languages in addition to C. Some architectures, such
as the IA-64 processor architecture, have been using GCC 3.0
from the get-go. The Debian releases for the x86 and other processors
will have to be migrated to GCC 3.0, which will be quite an
undertaking.


**Is that a Python in your pocket?** We're sure many Debian
developers were glad to see the Python 2.0.1 GPL-compatible release.
[Gregor Hoffleit](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0106/msg01485.html) has brought the transition topic up on the
debian-devel list for discussion.


**Debian Events.** There are four, count 'em, four events that
the Debian Project will be represented at in the upcoming week.
The Debian Project will have a presence at exhibitions and conferences
in France, Germany, Mexico and the United Kingdom. You can find out
more about these events, and future events, on the Debian Events
page: <https://www.debian.org/events/2001/>.


**Security.** Just one security issue to report this week.
Michal Zalewski discovered a problem with Samba, namely that
Samba does not properly validate names from remote machines
[using NetBIOS](https://www.debian.org/security/2001/dsa-065). Any Samba users will want to upgrade ASAP.


**As always** write us with your Debian-related news at
[dwn@debian.org](mailto:dwn@debian.org). Let us know
if your project is doing something exciting, or if there's been
interesting news on your mailing list. Have a great week!
