Debian Weekly News - May 6th, 2001
==================================


 **Welcome** to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian
community.


 **First - a new editor team for DWN.** Joey Hess was tired, but
a couple of people thought it would be a shame if DWN were to die, so
we asked if we might take over, and he let us. The lucky ones are [Jean-Christophe Helary](mailto:helary@eskimo.com), [Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier](mailto:jbrockmeier@earthlink.net) and [Tollef Fog Heen](mailto:tfheen@debian.org). Joey wants to thank the
hundreds of people who sent in mails of encouragement and thanks, and
wishes the new DWN staff well.


 **Since the last issue, [2.2r3
is out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-announce-01/msg00002.html).** It fixes quite a few security and release critical
bugs: an ntp root exploit, and samba symlink problems are among those.
Some of the security updates were incorrectly built on an unstable
system, which caused some confusion. This is fixed now. 


**The boot floppies are coming along, albeit slowly.** There have
been some troubles relating to slang and utf8, but those should be [mostly
worked out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0104/msg00737.html) now. The boot-floppies have been translated into [Danish](https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0104/msg00671.html),
and we have a Gaelic translation underway. Also, if we are to release
Woody this year,
[the boot-floppies
need much more help](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0104/msg00004.html). 


 **Ben Collins has already begun his work as Project Leader.**
So far, he is [beefing
up](https://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte-0104/msg00000.html) the technical committee, and both Bdale Garbee and Wichert
Akkerman have been added to it. 


 **On debian-devel, it has been a very busy week with long and
heated discussions** about whether [ALL:
PARANOID](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0104/msg01412.html) is a good setting to have in /etc/hosts.deny. Also there
has been some discussion related to chroot'ing BIND. The biggest
discussion is still ['kernel-{image,headers}
package bloat'](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0104/msg01316.html) where Herbert Xu, Craig Sanders and Daniel Stone
(and some other people) are flaming each other. Don't enter without
your asbestos suit.


**To CSS or not to CSS.** Should packages like [xine-dvd-css](http://samfundet.no/~tfheen/debian/dists/woody/css/binary-i386/xine-dvd-css_0.1.2-1_i386.deb)
go into main? None of the ftp-masters want to be the one responsible
for putting it in, so what will happen is still open to discussion
(and legal advice). Related to this is the continuous
crypto-in-main-discussion. Hopefully, this will be resolved with a
little lawyer's help.
**[dpkg
1.9 is out](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0104/msg00016.html).** It fixes a lot of segfaults and adds support for
signed packages. Also, it has new features, speedups, updated
translations, fixes for Hurd, HPPA, IA64 and SH. There are already a
couple of bugfix releases available, which fix some of the new and
exciting bugs. 


**Some of the new packages** which have made it into Debian this week are:
[cocoon2](https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/web/cocoon2.html),
[thttpd](https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/web/thttpd.html),
[nvclock](https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/x11/nvclock.html)
and [task-harden](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/task-harden)
[Feedback](mailto:dwn@debian.org) is always
appreciated
