Debian Weekly News - May 22nd, 2001
===================================


**Hurd F2 ISO Images** are now [available](https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0105/msg00052.html).
Get 'em while they're hot! For those folks who haven't heard of Hurd,
Debian GNU/Hurd is an OS based on the GNU Mach microkernel. It's not
quite up to production quality, but if the idea of an OS based on a
microkernel interests you be sure to check it out.
**Bloated /etc**. /etc is supposed to be small, since it has to
be in /. However, some packages put some big files in there; samba has
it's codepages directory taking 2.5MB. Bill Allombert [raised
the issue](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0105/msg01250.html), and the general consensus was that this should be fixed
by moving some of those files from /etc to /usr/share.
**Debian-User Weekly FAQ**. This subject pops up from time to
time on the Debian-User mailing list, but this time  [Yotam
Rubin](https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0105/msg00022.html) popped the question on the Debian-Doc list. The Debian-User
mailing list sees quite a bit of traffic, but would a specific FAQ cut
it down any? The discussion hasn't come to a specific resolution yet,
but you can check out the regular [Debian FAQ](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/).
**Accessing Secure Sites with Mozilla**. Apparently, the Mozilla
package currently available in main is outdated, based on Milestone
18, while version 0.9 is now available. It also comes without support
for secure Web sites. [Tham Kine Seng](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-0105/msg00071.html) got a quick response from several kind folks on the
list, and summarized instructions to install an "unofficial" Mozilla
package with security enabled.
**Using Public IP addresses in DMZ**. An interesting discussion,
with some helpful advice, popped up on the [Debian-Firewall](https://lists.debian.org/debian-firewall-0105/msg00055.html) discussion list.
**Am I insane?** A lot of people on the Debian-User mailing list
were asking that question when the list suddenly received more than
100 messages in German on Saturday. Apparently, someone had a news to
mail gateway misconfigured, but the problem seems to have abated
now. [Chris Cyll](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0105/msg03042.html), who's been studying too hard for German exams, was
particularly alarmed.
**New Packages**. Some of this week's most notable packages are
[agrep](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/text/agrep), a text search tool with support for approximate patterns,
[autotrace](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/autotrace), a package for converting bitmaps to vector graphics, [cowsay](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/games/cowsay), an absolutely vital program for turning text into happy
ASCII cows with speech balloons, and [junior-programming](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/junior-programming), programming packages for kids, part of the
Debian Jr. project. There's also the HTTP compression module for
Apache, [libapache-mod-gzip](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/libapache-mod-gzip) and [scalemail](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/mail/scalemail)
a scalable virtual mail domain system built with Postfix and LDAP.
**FAI 2.0 Released**. Another interesting program is [FAI](https://lists.debian.org/debian-beowulf-0105/msg00012.html),
a program that performs a fully automatic installation of Debian on
one or more PCs. Thomas Lange made the announcement on the
Debian-Beowulf mailing list.
