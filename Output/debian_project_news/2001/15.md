Debian Weekly News - June 25th, 2001
====================================


**MOSIX Correction:**
Last week we mentioned the [MOSIX](http://www.mosix.org/)
tool, and there may have been some confusion when we described it
as a "multi-platform" tool. MOSIX works on several OSes, but only
on the x86 architecture. However, ports for SPARC and Alpha are
under way as well.


**KDE 2.2 Alpha Packages:**
If you want to live on the bleeding edge, Ivan E. Moore II, the Debian
KDE maintainer has made preliminary [KDE 2.2
packages](https://lists.debian.org/debian-kde-0106/msg00042.html) available on people.debian.org. Thanks, Ivan!


**Inexpensive Linux Laptops:**
Chris Ivanovich is looking for an inexpensive laptop that is
Linux-friendly. He's gotten quite a few suggestions on the
debian-laptop list. If you have any suggestions, or are looking
for one yourself, check out [the
discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-laptop-0106/msg00147.html).


**When it rains...:**
Auric, Debian's FTP master server, [crashed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0106/msg00760.html)
during last Thursday's 'dinstall' run, which corrupted the database.
Consequently, testing disappeared for a day, but returned on Friday.


**Watch where you put that...:**
On debian-devel, the location of the traceroute program is the subject
of (another) [heated
discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0106/msg00790.html). Should it go into /usr/sbin or /usr/bin? Currently,
it makes its home in /usr/sbin -- where the package maintainer
believes it should be. As always, there are some strong opinions and
interesting points made, as well as a few silly ones -- almost as much
fun as watching two geeks argue over the relative merits of Emacs and
vi.


**Improving Qmail Performance:**
It's always good to get advice on how to improve system performance.
Jason Lim [has a recommendation](https://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0106/msg00221.html) on the debian-isp list that might be of
interest to Qmail users.


**Exim and outgoing SMTP AUTH:**
Andrew J. Perrin is a Telocity user who is [looking
for help](https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0106/msg02983.html) to make Exim work with his ISP's mail servers, which now
use SMTP AUTH. SMTP is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which
is used to transmit mail from one mail server to another. It typically
does not require a username/password pair to transmit mail, but to prevent
spammers abusing their mail servers to relay mail across the Internet,
ISPs usually use the IP address of the sender and the destination of
the mail to decide if they will accept it. Some ISPs are supplementing
this with the SMTP AUTH system, where in order to relay mail to another
machine, senders must provide a username and password. Unfortunately,
Telocity's idea of how this works doesn't quite match Exim's... If you
have any ideas, join in the thread on the debian-user mailing list.


**NewbieDoc News:**
We need more proto-newbies! If you've got a hurdle that you figured
out how to overcome -- maybe a configuration setting for Exim, or a
trick with Apache, or a command in vim -- we'd love to hear about it.
You'll be able to help someone tomorrow by documenting what you learned
today. Please help out -- see the [web site](http://newbiedoc.sourceforge.net/) or [mailing list](mailto:newbiedoc-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net) for more
details!


School finals have just about drained our talent pool dry recently,
so the NewbieDoc effort has been a bit quiet lately. Even so, Will
Trillich has been applying some PHP tricks to automate the NewbieDoc
listings, so our document listings are now generated on-the-fly, and
Romain Lerallut has re-wrapped the whole NewbieDoc set in tarball
form, and it's available for download now.


**Newbie Tip:**
If you haven't tried using Mutt to read your mail, you should give
it a whirl. First, "apt-get install mutt" and then run "mutt" to read
your messages. To see how powerful the customization features are, you
can visit a web site and [download some example configurations](http://linuxbrit.co.uk/mutt/) there.


**Security Advisories:**
Several have been issued this week for various Debian packages.
Take a look and see if you need to update your system:


* [fetchmail](https://www.debian.org/security/2001/dsa-060) -- buffer overflow
* [gnupg](https://www.debian.org/security/2001/dsa-061) -- printf format attack
* [rxvt](https://www.debian.org/security/2001/dsa-062) -- buffer overflow
* [xinetd](https://www.debian.org/security/2001/dsa-063) -- change default umask


As always, many thanks to the security team for their hard work.


**New packages this week:**


* [3dwm](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/3dwm-geoclient) -- a 3D user environment
* [kino](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/kino) -- a non-linear video editing tool
* [jfs](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/jfs) -- tools for managing (IBM's) JFS filesystem
* [bugzilla](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/bugzilla) -- Mozilla's bug tracking system
* [DBS](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/dbs) -- a debian build system with separated patchfiles


Also of special note, after a [heated thread](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0106/msg00245.html) on debian-devel,
last week Mozilla 0.9.1, the first new version since November 2000, was installed to non-US/main.
